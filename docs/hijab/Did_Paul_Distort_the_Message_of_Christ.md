### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUb8dxd63RI&t=0) - [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUb8dxd63RI&t=900)

 the YouTube user argues that Paul was not a reliable source of information about Jesus, and that the historical Jesus is more accurately revealed in the Quran. The user also argues that Muslims are the true followers of Jesus, as they have access to the original, undistorted message of him.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUb8dxd63RI&t=0)**  Paul is discussed, and it is shown that he has done a lot to shape conceptions about Jesus in the modern world. His biggest claim to legitimacy is the divine revelation he said he received from Jesus. Unfortunately, there is no way to independently verify his claims of mystical desert encounters with Jesus. However, what can be done to test his apostleship is to scrutinize his writings. It is shown that he made repeated claims of divine inspiration and since God is all-knowing and all-wise, it stands to reason that his writings should be free of error. A prophecy about the end of the world that can be found in both the Gospel of Mark and the Apostle Paul's own writings is examined, and it is shown that Paul clearly believed that the world's end was imminent. In order to make sense of his advice about living as bachelors and not feeling human emotions, and being detached from material things, if what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, then that prophet is not inspired by God. Therefore, it can be concluded that Paul himself did not qualify as an inspired prophet.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUb8dxd63RI&t=300)** , Paul is quoted from the Old Testament in order to argue that salvation is attained by faith alone, and that works are not necessary for righteousness. Paul's quote from the book of Isaiah is shown to be incorrect, as it mentions that the savior will come to Israel after they have repented of their sins.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUb8dxd63RI&t=600)**  examines the passage from Romans 2 which speaks about how "those who deny god are not righteous." Paul offers a reason for why god revealed the law to Moses and the Israelites, saying that it is so that we may realize that it is impossible to keep it. He contrasts this with what he claims is the original message - that those who say there is no god are not righteous. In the end, Paul takes four men with him and undergoes a public  shaving ritual derived from the law of Moses, which denies the rumors that he preached against the law of Moses. This raises the question of how truthful Paul's claims of apostolic authority and divine inspiration actually are.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUb8dxd63RI&t=900)** argues that, because the New Testament is full of inaccuracies, Paul was not the reliable source of information about Jesus that believers might believe. Furthermore, the author argues that the historical Jesus is more accurately revealed in the Quran, which unveils centuries of mythmaking around him. Muslims are, in fact, the true followers of Jesus, as they have access to the original, undistorted message of him.

[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=5) paul of tarsus has done more than any  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=7) other person in history to influence and  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=10) shape conceptions about the person and  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=12) message of jesus  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=14) in this video we are going to consider  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=16) the question is paul a reliable source  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=18) of information about jesus  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=25) the early followers of jesus were hunted  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=27) and persecuted by paul who started out  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=29) as a zealous enemy of christianity  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=32) then one day while on a sandy desert  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=34) road to damascus paul said they had a  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=36) mystical encounter with a disembodied  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=39) voice claiming to be jesus  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=41) from there paul went on to become a  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=43) super evangelist dedicating his life to  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=45) spreading what he claimed was the  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=47) message of jesus  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=49) paul's biggest claim to legitimacy as an  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=51) apostle is the divine revelation which  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=53) he said he received directly from jesus  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=56) for example paul wrote i want you to  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=59) know brothers and sisters that the  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=61) gospel i preached is not of human origin  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=64) rather i received it by revelation from  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=66) jesus christ  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=68) unfortunately there is no way of  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=70) independently verifying paul's claims of  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=73) mystical desert encounters with jesus we  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=75) just have to take him at his word  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=77) what we can do to test paul's  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=79) apostleship is to scrutinize his  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=81) writings  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=82) he made repeated claims of divine  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=84) inspiration and since god is all-knowing  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=86) and all-wise it stands to reason that  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=88) paul's writings should be free of error  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=96) in the following prophecy paul provided  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=98) a timeline for the world's end  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=101) we will not all sleep but we will all be  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=103) changed in a flash in the twinkling of  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=105) an eye at the last trumpet  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=108) for the trumpet will sound the dead will  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=110) be raised imperishable and we will be  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=112) changed  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=113) sleep here is being used as a metaphor  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=115) for death so paul seems to be saying  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=117) that not all of the believers in his day  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=119) would die before the return of jesus  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=122) obviously this is a false prophecy as it  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=124) has been nearly 2 000 years since paul  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=127) wrote these words and the return of  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=129) jesus still has not taken place  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=132) in fact many new testament scholars and  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=134) thinkers conclude that paul and his  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=136) followers expected the imminent end of  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=138) the world  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=139) for example the distinguished new  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=140) testament scholar professor c k barrett  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=143) wrote in his commentary on this prophecy  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=145) paul expects that at the parousia second  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=148) coming of jesus he himself will not be  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=150) among the dead of whom he speaks in the  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=152) third person but among the living of  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=155) whom he speaks in the first person he  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=157) expected the parousia within his own  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=159) lifetime  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=160) a virtually identical end-of-world  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=162) prophecy can be found in the gospel of  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=164) mark the renowned christian apologist c  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=167) s lewis wrote that it is the most  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=170) embarrassing verse in the bible  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=172) now some christians try to defend paul  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=174) by claiming that when he made the  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=176) statement we will not all sleep he was  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=178) not including the believers of his day  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=180) among those who will not taste death but  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=183) rather he was referring to believers at  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=185) some unspecified time in the future  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=187) so what did paul intend by a statement  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=190) shall we interpret it literally or  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=191) figuratively  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=192) we can look to paul's related prophecies  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=195) to help us arrive at the correct  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=196) understanding  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=197) in the following prophecy paul advised  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=199) believers with regards to how they  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=201) should conduct themselves going forward  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=204) but those who marry will face many  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=205) troubles in this life and i want to  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=207) spare you this what i mean brothers and  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=209) sisters is that the time is short from  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=212) now on those who have wives should live  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=214) as if they do not  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=216) those who mourn as if they did not  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=218) those who are happy as if they were not  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=221) those who buy something as if it were  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=223) not theirs to keep  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=224) those who use the things of the world as  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=226) if not engrossed in them for this world  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=228) in its present form is passing away  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=231) note paul's statements about marriage  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=233) emotions and materialism  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=235) believers are told that all such  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=236) activities are futile as time is short  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=239) and the world is passing away believers  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=241) are advised to avoid such things from  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=243) now on i.e with immediate effect going  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=246) forward  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=246) this is clear proof that paul genuinely  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=249) believed that the world's end was  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=250) imminent otherwise his advice about  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=252) living as bachelors not feeling human  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=254) emotions and being completely detached  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=256) from material things is nonsensical as  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=259) christians would have been unnecessarily  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=261) going about life as celibate emotionless  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=263) ascetics for nearly 2 000 years and  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=265) counting  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=266) this is highly problematic when we  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=268) consider the standard that the old  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=269) testament lays out for true divine  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=271) inspiration  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=272) if what a prophet proclaims in the name  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=274) of the lord does not take place or come  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=276) true that is a message the lord has not  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=279) spoken  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=280) we can see that according to the bible  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=282) itself anyone who makes a claim about  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=284) the future which then fails to come true  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=286) cannot be inspired by god  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=294) one of paul's core teachings is the idea  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=296) that salvation is achieved through faith  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=298) in jesus alone and not any kind of works  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=301) as paul informed us but what does it say  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=304) the word is near you it is in your mouth  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=307) and in your heart  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=308) that is the message concerning faith  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=310) that we proclaim  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=312) if you declare with your mouth jesus is  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=314) lord and believe in your heart that god  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=316) raised him from the dead you will be  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=317) saved  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=319) here paul is quoting from the old  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=320) testament in order to lend support to  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=322) his theology that we are saved by faith  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=324) alone and not works  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=326) let's take a look at the original  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=327) passage in the book of deuteronomy  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=330) the word is very near you it is in your  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=332) mouth and in your heart so you may obey  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=334) it  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=335) notice the problem paul has taken the  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=338) quarter of its original context he left  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=340) out the part that states so you may obey  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=342) it  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=343) in other words paul has omitted god's  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=345) command to obey the mosaic law  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=348) we can see that the original passage in  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=349) the old testament actually establishes  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=351) the opposite of what paul intended works  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=353) are indeed important  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=361) another of paul's core teachings is the  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=363) idea that all of god's covenantal  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=365) promises to abraham were fulfilled by  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=367) the coming of jesus as paul informed us  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=371) the promises were spoken to abraham and  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=373) to his seed scripture does not say  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=376) antecedes meaning many people but unto  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=379) your seed meaning one person who is  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=381) christ  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=383) here paul is making the argument that  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=385) god's promise to abraham did not speak  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=387) of seeds in the plural but rather seed  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=389) in the singular and concludes that the  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=391) single seed is a reference to one man  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=393) i.e jesus  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=395) let's take a look at the original  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=397) passage in the book of genesis  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=399) and i will establish my covenant with  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=401) him for an everlasting covenant and with  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=403) his seed after him  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=405) the original hebrew word used for seed  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=407) is zera which is a collective noun that  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=409) can be used to refer to both a single  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=411) descendant or many descendants it  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=413) depends on the context in which it  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=415) appears this is just like the english  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=417) language for example the word sheep can  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=419) mean one sheep or many depending on the  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=421) context  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=423) so how should we interpret the mention  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=424) of seed in the old testament we find an  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=427) answer in the same book of genesis  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=429) and i will make thy seed as the dust of  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=431) the earth so that if a man can number  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=434) the dust of the earth then shall thy  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=436) seed also be numbered  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=438) here god promised abraham that he will  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=439) be blessed with a multitude of  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=441) descendants  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=442) likening his seed to the dust of the  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=444) earth  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=445) therefore we can see that the correct  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=446) context for seed is not a single seed as  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=449) paul incorrectly interpreted it but  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=451) rather many  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=458) paul taught that the nation of israel  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=460) will be saved from its sins through  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=461) jesus as paul informed us and in this  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=464) way all israel will be saved as it is  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=467) written the deliverer will come from  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=469) zion he will turn godlessness away from  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=471) jacob  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=472) here paul has quoted from the old  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=474) testament book of isaiah  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=476) the redeemer will come to zion to those  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=478) in jacob who repent of their sins  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=480) declares the lord  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=482) note the clear mismatch paul's quote  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=484) mentions that the savior will remove sin  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=486) from israel whereas the book of isaiah  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=488) states that their savior will come to  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=490) israel after is repented from sin  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=493) just what is going on here  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=495) paul may have been quoting from the  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=496) septuagint a greek version of the old  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=498) testament  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=499) and the deliverer shall come for sion's  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=501) sake and shall turn away ungodliness  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=503) from jacob  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=505) we can see that paul's quote closely  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=507) matches the greek septuagint  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=509) it turns out that there are two variant  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=511) readings of the old testament the one in  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=513) hebrew and the greek septuagint that  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=515) paul seems to have quoted from  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=517) there is in fact strong evidence that  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=519) the greek septuagint contains a later  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=521) reading this is because the dead sea  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=523) scrolls the oldest surviving manuscripts  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=525) for the old testament support the  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=527) reading that is found in the hebrew  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=528) scriptures  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=529) this means that when paul chose to quote  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=531) from the greek septuagint he unknowingly  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=533) used the later incorrect reading god  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=536) obviously would not have inspired him to  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=537) make such a mistake  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=544) paul argued that nobody can achieve  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=546) righteousness through the works of the  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=548) mosaic law as paul informed us as it is  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=551) written there is no unrighteous not even  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=554) one there is no one who understands  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=556) there is no one who seeks god  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=558) their throats are open graves their  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=560) tongues practice deceit  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=562) the poison of vipers is on their lips  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=565) their mouths are full of cursing and  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=566) bitterness  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=568) their feet are swift to shed blood  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=570) there is no fear of god before their  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=572) eyes  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=573) therefore no one will be declared  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=575) righteous in god's sight by the works of  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=576) the law  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=578) what paul quotes here is a compilation  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=580) of six separate passages from the old  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=581) testament book of psalms and isaiah he  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=584) has strung them together to appear as  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=586) one quote  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=587) let's examine one of the passages that  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=589) paul referenced from psalm 14  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=592) the fool says in his heart there is no  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=594) god they are corrupt their deeds are  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=596) vile there is no one who does good  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=599) do all these evildoers know nothing  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=601) they devour my people as though eating  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=603) bread  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=604) they never call on the lord but there  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=606) they are overwhelmed with dread for god  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=609) is present in the company of the  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=610) righteous  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=611) we can see that the original passage is  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=613) talking about those who say there is no  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=615) god  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=616) it is these people who are said to do no  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=618) good such evildoers are then contrasted  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=620) with a second group of people referred  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=622) to as my people who are said to be the  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=624) company of the righteous  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=626) it turns out that paul has distorted  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=628) this passage it does not say as paul  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=631) quotes it that no human being is  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=633) righteous rather it says that those who  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=635) deny god are not righteous  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=642) paul offered the following reason as to  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=644) why god revealed the law to moses and  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=646) the israelites  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=648) now we know that whatever the law says  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=650) it says to those who are under the law  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=652) that for this purpose every mouth may be  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=654) stopped and all the world may become  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=656) guilty before god  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=658) according to paul the law was revealed  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=660) to make us realize that it is impossible  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=662) to keep and that we are therefore all  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=664) guilty before god  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=666) let's compare this to what god has to  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=668) say about the law in the old testament  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=670) now what i am commanding you today is  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=672) not too difficult for you or beyond your  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=674) reach no the word is very near you it is  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=677) in your mouth and in your heart so you  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=679) may obey it  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=680) we can see that god says very clearly  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=682) that the law is not too difficult to  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=684) obey or beyond our reach which is the  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=686) complete opposite of what paul claimed  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=689) paul even had some very negative things  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=690) to say about the law here he called it a  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=693) curse  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=694) for as many as are of the works of the  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=696) law are under a curse  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=698) paul also had bad things to say about  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=700) his past efforts of keeping the law  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=702) here he referred to it as garbage as for  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=704) righteousness based on the law faultless  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=707) but whatever word gains to me i now  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=709) consider loss for the sake of christ i  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=711) consider them garbage  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=713) again such negativity is at odds with  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=715) what the old testament teaches for i  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=717) command you today to love the lord your  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=719) god to walk in obedience to him and to  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=722) keep his commands decrees and laws  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=725) then you will live and increase and the  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=727) lord your god will bless you  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=729) here god stated that obeying the law  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=731) will bring one blessing and prosperity  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=734) we can see that paul's teachings about  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=735) the law completely contradict the old  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=737) testament on many points so paul cannot  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=740) have gotten his message from the same  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=741) god that inspired the old testament  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=749) the bible informs us that towards the  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=751) end of his ministerial career paul  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=753) visited jerusalem which was home to  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=755) thousands of christians who zealously  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=757) obeyed the law of moses we are told that  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=759) senior christians directly confronted  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=761) paul about rumors that he was preaching  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=763) against the law of moses  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=765) the next day paul and the rest of us  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=767) went to see james and all the elders  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=769) were present  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=770) then they said to paul you see brother  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=773) how many thousands of jews have believed  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=775) and all of them are zealous for the law  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=777) they have been informed that you teach  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=779) all the jews who live among the gentiles  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=781) to turn away from moses telling them not  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=783) to circumcise their children or live  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=785) according to our customs  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=787) if paul was a genuine apostle then we  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=789) should expect him to be forthcoming  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=791) about his true beliefs and teachings  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=793) let's now see how paul actually reacted  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=796) what shall we do they will certainly  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=798) hear that you have come so do what we  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=800) tell you  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=801) there are four men with us who have made  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=803) a vow  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=804) take these men  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=806) joining their purification rights and  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=808) paid their expenses so that they can  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=810) have their heads shaved  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=811) then everyone will know there is no  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=814) truth in these reports about you  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=816) the next day paul took the men and  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=818) purified himself along with them  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=820) we can see that the senior christians in  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=822) jerusalem commanded paul to undergo a  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=825) public head shaving ritual that was  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=827) derived from the law of moses  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=829) paul submissively complied with their  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=831) command thus denying the rumors that he  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=833) preached against the law of moses  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=836) now in the previous section we saw  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=837) examples of paul's negative attitude  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=839) towards a mosaic law labeling it a curse  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=842) and describing efforts to obey it as  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=844) garbage  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=845) by conducting himself in this manner  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=847) paul was being two-faced for he behaved  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=849) in one way to the faces of senior  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=851) christians and another way in his  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=853) writings  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=854) in the following examples paul wrote  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=856) that jews are the same as non-jews and  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=859) no longer bound to keep any of the  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=860) mosaic law  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=862) there is neither jew nor greek  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=865) we have been released from the law so  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=866) that we serve in the new way of the  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=868) spirit and not in the old way of the  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=870) written code  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=872) we can see that paul taught the very  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=873) things he was accused of and deceptively  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=875) denied  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=882) in this video we've examined a number of  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=884) paul's writings and found many issues  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=887) which seriously undermine his claims of  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=889) apostleship and divine inspiration  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=891) a big problem which arises from this  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=894) is the fact that paul dominates the  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=896) pages of the new testament with over  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=898) half of its books being attributed to  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=899) him  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=900) so when one reads new testament and  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=902) takes it at face value you are viewing  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=904) jesus through the lens of paul who has  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=906) been proven to be an unreliable source  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=908) sincere truth-seeking christians faced  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=911) the difficult task of peeling away  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=913) layers of myth in order to try and  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=915) arrive at the true historical jesus  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=918) god out of his mercy for mankind did not  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=920) leave us in a state of confusion  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=922) the quran was revealed and unravels  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=924) centuries of myth-making around jesus  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=927) muslims are the true followers of jesus  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=930) as thanks to the quran we have access to  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=932) and implement his original undistorted  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/FUb8dxd63RI?t=934) message
