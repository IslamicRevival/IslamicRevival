[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=38) i've done before about issues relating  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=40) to lgbtq  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=42) especially pertaining to the muslim  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=43) community the tradition is muslim oh you  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=45) just call it the muslim community and in  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=48) the previous video that i made i was  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=50) speaking particularly about some  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=51) approaches of  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=52) uh some dawah organizations  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=55) um i mentioned ikna i mentioned yakreen  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=57) i mentioned some figures  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=59) of dawah like  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=62) dr jonathan brown and other individuals  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=65) who are i would consider big players in  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=67) the tawa at least or in the public  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=69) discourse and rightfully so because they  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=71) have made many contributions which some  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=74) of their detractors  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=75) will never be able to make let alone  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=77) have made in the past for example  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=79) yesterday has done some great work  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=82) especially relating to the seerah that  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=84) he's put up in the english language i  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=85) think i don't think  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=86) almost anyone has done anything like  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=88) that in terms of the effort and the  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=90) output that was put into that and the  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=92) originality and the  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=93) research that must have been put into  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=95) such a thing  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=96) likewise  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=98) he's done really great work and when it  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=100) comes to the production quality of some  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=102) of the things that have come up from  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=102) japan i think everyone agrees that it's  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=104) really brilliant and excellent and when  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=106) he comes and  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=108) speaks especially when he storytells and  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=110) i have to say it's really really like  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=112) inspirational the way he speaks about  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=114) some of the prophets of the past and  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=116) some of the companions of the past  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=117) masha'allah is really it's excellent and  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=119) jonathan brown an excellent a star a  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=122) great academic who's done some really  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=124) great work in the past and i think a lot  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=125) of the detractors that do attack these  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=127) people may have perverse intentions  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=129) quite frankly i mean  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=131) and  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=132) i will repeat will not in the future  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=135) let alone have in the past be able to  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=137) produce anything like what these  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=139) individuals have produced in terms of  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=141) their contribution to the islamic  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=142) discourse for the muslim people  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=145) so we have benefited from that and i  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=146) think it's important to start with that  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=148) kind of recognition because these people  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=150) have been in the dawa and in the public  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=152) space much longer than we have and we  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=155) uh you know have benefited i have  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=156) personally benefited so much from all  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=159) three individuals i must say  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=161) and so i don't want anyone to think  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=163) that this is trying to you know cancel  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=166) them or something like this and  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=167) what do we gain from that they're our  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=169) friends we have a good personal  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=170) relationship with them i've spoken to  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=172) yesterday twice we've done two podcasts  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=175) together jonathan brown has done a  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=176) podcast with him we have a good personal  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=178) relationship there's no need or reason  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=180) or personal gain that i get from this at  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=182) all  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=184) at all the second thing i'll say is  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=187) they've done great work and they  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=188) continue to do great work and we don't  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=189) want to disturb that great work  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=192) not having said all that  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=194) what i will say is this  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=196) there are some approaches which need to  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=198) be examined okay there are some  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=200) approaches that need to be examined now  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=201) recently i was very encouraged to find  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=204) that after i done my first video  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=207) that jacquin actually done a webinar  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=210) uh  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=212) sorry they've done webinar we are  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=213) cleaned on a webinar  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=215) on lgbtq uh issues i think that was the  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=218) name of the webinar and they did clarify  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=221) a lot a lot of things they clarified the  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=223) ah cam of same-sex relationships and so  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=226) on and i was very encouraged to see this  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=228) uh clarification and unhappy and really  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=232) i i i salute the the effort and commend  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=235) it uh genuinely i'm not just saying i'm  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=237) not just saying that and even  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=239) came out and made a video about  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=240) transgenderism and the fetus on on that  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=243) and so on and honestly i really  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=246) appreciate the self-reflective nature of  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=249) the institute that you've been able to  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=250) do all that kind of thing  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=252) but what i will say is this  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=255) the level of clarification there's a  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=257) question i have to you  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=259) is the level of clarification  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=263) in line or commensurate with the level  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=266) of  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=266) doubt or shubha that has been created  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=268) this is a question for me to you is the  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=271) level of clarification that has been  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=272) provided  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=273) commensurate  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=274) or  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=276) with the level of subha that has been  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=277) created now you may ask why should there  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=280) be such a subha when we have  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=282) consistently made  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=284) you know our points clear on the ham of  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=286) same-sex relationships i'll tell you why  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=289) and since i've had these  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=290) conversations online public  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=292) conversations which are which are on the  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=294) public record which people can watch  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=296) i'll give you three examples of it in  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=299) fact  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=300) the level of shubha or doubt has been  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=302) created on account  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=304) of some of the stances that jacquin have  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=306) taken  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=307) for example jonathan brown made an  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=310) article  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=311) or has written an article that was then  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=313) put onto jaquin which argued for the  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=316) case of us supporting as the muslim  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=318) community same-sex marriage  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=320) now he says it wasn't an islamic case  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=322) and he put so many caveats it wasn't  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=325) quid pro quo and it wasn't this and so  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=327) on  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=328) nevertheless  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=329) it was an article that argued that  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=331) muslim people should vote for homosexual  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=335) marriage in america or maybe elsewhere  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=337) okay  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=339) and it was on a  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=341) website of an organization which was  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=343) meant to represent the interests of the  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=345) muslim people and it was really  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=347) an apolo it is really an apologetic  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=349) organization which was meant to deal  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=351) with the doubts of the people  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=353) if it is a political  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=355) article what is it doing  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=357) on  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=358) an islamic website  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=361) isn't that shopper that is being created  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=364) so the question now which begs itself  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=367) is  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=368) can muslim people support such a thing  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=369) which is antithetical to their own  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=371) beliefs are you telling me that such a  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=372) thing was not a supper it was a supper  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=375) and the evidence of that  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=376) is that it was removed subsequently  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=379) after these discussions were had in the  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=381) public sphere after we had him on the mh  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=383) podcast after the muslim community  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=385) wasn't buying quite frankly the series  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=387) of justifications that jonathan brown  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=389) has put forward  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=391) it was removed but was removed without  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=393) clarification  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=395) it was removed without consolation it  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=397) was removed without retraction formal  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=399) retraction it was just  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=401) inconsequent conspicuously removed  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=404) and is that enough is that sufficient  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=406) for the muslim community i i say no it's  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=409) not enough after you've done something  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=411) like that which no muslim scholar in the  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=412) history of islam has argued  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=415) you make an argument that no  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=417) precedent has been given for  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=419) jurisprudentially  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=421) and then you just remove it and then no  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=423) clarification is given i think that is  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=425) quite frankly not fair on the muslim  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=427) community  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=429) a second example is there's an entire  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=431) framework that  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=432) man has put forward on fruitful  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=434) coalition building he calls it and it's  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=436) still up there now and he's got levels  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=439) of it and we're seeing almost  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=441) you know shake hands and hold hands and  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=443) so on with members of the lgbtq  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=446) community  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=447) walking in the parades and doing these  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=449) practices and rituals and all these kind  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=450) of things which has been refuted for and  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=452) rightfully so quite frankly  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=455) and then  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=457) where is i mean is the level of  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=459) apology and the level of clarification  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=461) was it  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=463) was it in line with that you have to ask  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=465) yourself that question you have to ask  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=467) yourself that question  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=469) secondly  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=470) why is it the case that the only  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=473) relationship that the big players of  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=476) american da'wah have had with  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=478) homosexuals is one where they're a  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=481) either on the back foot or b trying to  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=483) build coalitions is this really the  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=485) quranic model  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=488) well it's not  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=500) is that we the only thing the muslims  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=502) are doing with  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=503) individuals who are self-proclaimed  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=506) happily homosexuals is this  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=511) i don't think you'd sorry to say i'm  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=512) sorry i'm so sorry i don't think you  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=514) would endorse that in the least  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=517) why have you never given doubt why have  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=518) we never seen any of you give dawah  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=521) to individuals who are exhibiting this  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=523) feeling  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=524) from the non-muslim community  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=526) true relationship building  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=530) is not having a phony relationship based  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=532) on disingenuous beliefs  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=536) or that you try and put the elephant  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=537) under the carpet or something  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=540) no  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=541) true relationship building is where you  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=543) agree to disagree  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=545) that is why  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=546) the homosexual community some of which  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=549) they have no problem with me  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=550) it's all for the public record to see  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=552) i've had conversations with them in the  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=554) public space  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=555) and after i've explained to them my  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=558) entire ethos and my all my beliefs  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=561) it's still agreed to disagree and it's  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=562) actually happy days because there is  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=564) tolerance in that community i mean it's  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=565) not like they're completely intolerant  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=566) to the muslim people do you have such  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=569) uh maybe  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=570) fear that they'll you'll be rejected by  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=572) them that you cannot even engage with  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=574) them in a positive manner telling them  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=575) what islam is  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=577) why have we not seen one  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=580) single video  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=582) or something on the public record where  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=584) you are challenging the beliefs  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=586) and the stances and the practices of  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=588) those individuals who we call brothers  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=591) and sisters in humanity  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=592) if you really want the best for someone  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=594) you share what you think you have with  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=596) them  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=597) it's not it's  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=600) that's the second criticism so this is a  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=602) weak  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=602) approach and this weakness was exhibited  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=606) for all to see  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=608) in the following clip which i found was  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=611) well when i first saw it i was very  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=613) upset and angered on behalf of shaykh  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=616) let's watch let's watch the clip  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=617) together do you see how that's  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=619) problematic for a lot of people  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=620) listening who'll say you say they're  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=621) welcome in your mosque but they're  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=622) welcome as sinners and that  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=624) well it's not it's not our it's not our  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=627) uh job to judge others i'm willing to  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=629) allow them their rights are they willing  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=631) to allow me my rights when you say  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=632) you're willing to allow them their  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=633) rights their political rights  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=635) do you support same-sex marriage i  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=636) support the notion that the american  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=638) government is not in charge of morality  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=640) so you're not opposed to same-sex  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=642) marriage  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=643) politically yes but but morally i i  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=646) don't agree with this so there's a  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=647) there's a difference  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=648) of the land you're not complaining  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=650) do you think  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=652) that  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=653) this is fair  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=654) that a member of the  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=657) so-called scholarly classes  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=659) the high echelons of islamic  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=661) intellectuality  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=664) is put in front of an individual  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=666) actually two of them but let's focus on  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=668) linda  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=669) an individual who is flirting with  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=672) clandestine apostasy  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=676) and that she's putting you on the back  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=677) foot  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=680) well it breaks my heart to see that  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=683) she's putting you on the back foot  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=685) and she's mentioning things which have  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=687) in them the potential for riddha  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=690) apostasy and they're going unchallenged  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=692) this is an individual who's wearing a  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=694) head scarf  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=695) she's in front of a man of deen religion  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=698) and she's saying we basically it's a  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=700) paraphrase that she thinks the cause of  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=702) homosexuality is the same islamic cause  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=704) you put that to linda you're an american  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=705) muslim civil rights activist you  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=707) campaign against islamophobia in favor  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=709) of muslim civil rights but you also  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=710) campaign against homophobia and in favor  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=713) of lgbt rights do you see that as all  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=715) part of the same struggle  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=717) absolutely and i will say this about  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=718) american muslims there has not been any  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=720) coordinated coordinated campaign  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=722) oppositional to the supreme court um  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=724) decision for same-sex marriage and  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=726) you're not correcting that in fact  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=727) you're just revere you're talking about  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=729) your own track record and defending  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=730) yourself yeah not even islam but quite  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=732) frankly yourself well let me put that  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=734) point to it well that's exactly what  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=735) i've been doing linda if you actually  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=736) listen to the lectures that are on  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=738) youtube uh i would say i'm one of the  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=739) very few clerics that have very publicly  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=742) said do you think this is going to give  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=744) islam and muslims  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=749) it is a failed approach and it's not an  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=752) approach that is going to yield any uh  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=754) positive effects  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=756) and it's likely to  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=758) mark all of the good work you've done  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=760) elsewhere  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=761) and i see that as a real tragedy in fact  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=763) and it hurts me to say it  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=766) it hurts me to say it but i'm angered  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=768) and disappointed  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=770) and i never saw this video before i only  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=771) saw this quite recently when i saw it i  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=773) was very disappointed when i  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=775) to see a woman like that yeah  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=778) a woman like that  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=780) yanni put you on the back foot yes  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=783) in that way  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=784) yeah and you couldn't even ask a couple  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=786) of questions that would have put her  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=787) directly on the back foot do you  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=788) consider homosexuality as a sin  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=790) it would have it would have if she said  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=792) yes  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=793) then it would so how do you  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=795) then you can follow up if she said no  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=797) then you can excommunicate her you can  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=800) excommunicate from the fault of islam  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=802) after you do it kamas alhaja and then  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=804) you put her in the back foot again you  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=806) you strip her of the fake identity that  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=808) then she would be putting upon herself  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=810) this is the isa we require this is the  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=813) clear-cut  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=814) straight talking kulu kola and sadida  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=816) that we need  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=818) it's not fair that the muslims have this  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=821) level of representation quite frankly on  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=823) issues so  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=824) topical as these  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=826) and then you know and then confusion is  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=829) put in the atmosphere so i've given you  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=830) three clear cut examples  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=834) of why the shah as is as it is  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=837) why the doubt has been created in the  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=840) minds of the muslims the issue is not  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=842) just an issue of ideology  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=845) or belief  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=846) the issue is also an issue of attitude  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=850) what made the civil rights movement so  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=852) successful was not just the arguments  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=854) that  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=855) black people were making say for example  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=856) in the 1960s  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=859) it was the spirit that they came with  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=860) the attitude that they came with  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=862) the confidence that they came with  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=865) if they had placid and docile and timid  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=868) and weak attitudes and their temperament  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=871) wasn't fit for purpose the civil rights  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=873) movement wouldn't be what it is  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=876) no change would have been made  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=878) if they had shaken hands with the wrong  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=880) people or tried to take protection and  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=882) seek shelter from individuals who in  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=885) their reality don't want the best for  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=887) the for their own communities  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=889) it wouldn't have been as successful as  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=890) it is he tell you and all of us  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=894) that these people are the sheep  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=896) or the wolves in sheep sheep's clothing  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=900) and he would tell us  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=902) if you take inspiration from him  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=906) to seek self-sufficiency  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=909) after  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=910) allah  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=912) so this is my final advice  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=915) my final advice to you guys  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=917) is don't just change your approach which  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=920) of course you do need to change  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=923) you need to be more polemical forthright  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=925) you need to put your position forward  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=928) put them on the back foot  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=930) but not just that change your attitudes  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=933) because if you don't start  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=935) having a confident attitude to these  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=938) issues  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=940) our people will suffer  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=943) our people will suffer  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=945) more than they have already suffered  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=951) your brothers and sisters in islam net  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=953) from norway are establishing a masjid a  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=956) dhawa center

[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=960) institution will act like a beacon of  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=963) light calling the muslims in norway back  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=966) to the essence of islam so give  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/i3VL7t5kt54?t=968) generously and allah will give you even
