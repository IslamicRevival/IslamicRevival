## Description

The main proof of Muhammad’s Prophethood, peace and blessings be upon him, is and forever will be the Miraculous Qur’an which was revealed by God to him through the Angel Gabriel. God Almighty, out of His mercy for the Jews and Christians (respectfully referred to in the Qur’an as the People of the Book) also provided an additional proof to mankind of his Prophethood. This can be found in their very own scriptures, the Torah and Gospels. This video discusses the 42nd chapter of the Old Testament Book of Isaiah which clearly foretells the coming of an Arabian Prophet, specifically Prophet Muhammad.

 Muhammad discusses the similarities and differences between his hometown of Mecca and the city of Jerusalem in the Bible. He highlights the importance of both cities to Muslims and highlights the similarities and differences between the two.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpny44O0eEQ&t=0)** The 42nd chapter of the Book of Isaiah foretells the coming of an Arabian prophet, specifically Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him. The chapter describes this prophet as "my servant whom I uphold my chosen one in whom I delight." Three of the Prophet Muhammad's names are mentioned- servant chosen one and in whom I delight, and beloved of God, Habib Allah. The Quran reveals the location of this special person as being within Arabia, specifically Medina in Saudi Arabia. The importance of this revelation is that it confirms that the Prophet Muhammad was not a new prophet, but rather confirmed the law of Moses which was already present. The new song mentioned cannot refer to Jesus, as he did not bring about anything new, but rather followed the law of Moses throughout his life.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpny44O0eEQ&t=300)**  Muhammad is compared to Jesus, and it is shown that Jesus did not accomplish the same things that Muhammad did. It is also mentioned that Christians persecuted Muslims for hundreds of years after Jesus. Finally, God warns people that if they do not listen to Muhammad, they will not listen to him in time to come.

[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=9) clearly foretells the coming of an  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=11) Arabian prophet specifically Prophet  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=14) Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=16) I say it describes itself as a prophecy  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=19) about the future God states that the  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=22) former things have taken place and new  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=24) things I declare God starts the chapter  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=27) by drawing our attention to a very  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=29) special person that he was send he  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=31) describes this person as my servant whom  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=34) I uphold my chosen one in whom I delight  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=38) at least three of the names of the  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=41) Prophet Muhammad I mentioned servant  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=43) chosen one and in whom I delight I say  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=49) it is originally written in Hebrew  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=51) Arabic and Hebrew sure a lot of common  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=53) words because they are both Semitic  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=55) languages I say it uses the Hebrew word  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=58) Abed for servant the Arabic word for  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=62) servant is Abaddon Prophet Muhammad is  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=64) known as God's servant in Arabic  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=67) Abdullah chosen one is Mustafa in Arabic  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=72) this is another of the names of the  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=74) Prophet Muhammad the one in whom God  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=76) delights in shows that this person is  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=79) beloved to God Habib Allah in Arabic  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=82) which means beloved of God also happens  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=85) to be one of the Prophet Mohammad's  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=87) names  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=90) and I say God also reveals the location  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=93) of this special person he states let the  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=96) wilderness and it's towns raise their  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=98) voices let the settlements where kadar  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=101) lives rejoice out of all the nations on  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=105) earth that God inspired Isaiah to  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=107) mention he chose to highlight Kedar  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=110) location so we should pay special  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=112) attention throughout the Bible ke Dodd  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=116) and his sons are linked to Arabia for  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=118) example The Book of Ezekiel tells us  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=120) that Arabia and all the princes of Kedar  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=124) were your favorite dealers and lambs  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=126) Rams and goats in these they did  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=129) business with you  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=134) and I say a God goes on to narrow the  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=137) location down further to a specific city  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=140) within Arabia  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=141) he states that the people of Silla  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=144) should sing for joy let them shout from  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=147) the mountaintops the place Allah  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=149) pinpoints the exact location in Arabia  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=152) the place being spoken of is the city of  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=155) Medina in Saudi Arabia because Salah is  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=158) the name of a famous mountain in Medina  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=163) Medina was the city of the Prophet  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=166) Mohammed  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=166) an important point worth mentioning is  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=169) that historically we know there was a  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=171) presence of various Jewish tribes in  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=174) Medina before the advent of the Prophet  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=176) Muhammad both Jewish historians and  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=179) Islamic history records this fact the  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=182) question then arises why were the  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=184) numerous Jewish tribes within Medina the  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=188) answer is that the Leonard Jews were  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=190) aware of this prophecy in Isaiah and  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=192) were anxiously awaiting the coming of a  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=196) new prophet Islamic history records the  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=199) fact that whenever a dispute arose  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=201) between the Jews and the Arabs in Medina  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=204) the Jews used to taunt their pagan Arab  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=207) neighbors by saying when our prophet  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=210) arrives we shall obliterate you the  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=214) Quran also affirms this God says is it  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=218) not a sign to them that the learned men  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=220) of the children of Israel knew it as  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=222) true  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=227) in i say 'god informs us that the  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=230) special person will bring something new  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=232) mankind is told that we will sing to the  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=235) Lord a new song his praise from the ends  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=238) of the earth the statement a new song  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=240) means a new law a new way of worship  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=243) this is exactly what Islam represents  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=246) the emphasis on the new song here is  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=249) singing the praise of God all over the  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=251) earth the Quran opens with the statement  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=253) praise be to God Lord of the Worlds and  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=256) is recited by Muslims all over the world  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=259) during prayers every day the new song  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=262) cannot refer to Jesus because he did not  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=266) bring about anything new rather he  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=268) confirmed the law of Moses that was  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=270) already there in the Gospel of Matthew  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=272) Jesus said think not I am come to  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=274) destroy the law or the prophets I am not  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=277) come to destroy but fulfil Jesus obeyed  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=281) and followed the law of Moses throughout  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=283) his life Jesus didn't sing a new song he  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=286) sang the same song of Moses the Torah  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=289) moreover the disciples of Jesus also  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=291) follow the law of Moses even after Jesus  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=294) departed in the book of Acts we are told  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=296) that the disciples look to the Torah for  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=298) guidance  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=299) for the law of Moses has been preached  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=301) in every city from the earliest times  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=307) in i say 'god emphasizes the universal  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=311) mission of the coming person by  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=313) mentioning that he will be made a  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=315) covenant all the people and a light for  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=318) the Gentiles Gentiles means non-jews the  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=322) Quran confirms the Prophet Muhammad  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=324) peace be upon him was sent to the whole  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=326) of mankind Jews and Gentiles alike in  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=329) the Quran God tells us we have sent you  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=332) a prophet as a bearer of glad tidings  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=334) and a Warner for the whole of mankind  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=337) but most people have no knowledge the  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=340) verse in Isaiah can not apply to Jesus  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=343) because in the Gospel of Matthew Jesus  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=345) said I was sent only to the lost sheep  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=348) of Israel and I say a God further states  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=351) that he will lead the blind byways they  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=353) have not known along unfamiliar paths I  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=356) will guide them the pagan Arabs at the  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=359) time of the Prophet Mohammed fit this  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=360) description perfectly because they had  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=363) not been sent a messenger prior to  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=365) Muhammad the Quran bears witness to this  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=367) God states that Muhammad was sent to  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=370) Warner people to whom no Warner has come  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=372) before the verson I say cannot apply to  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=376) Jesus because his people the Israelites  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=379) had already received a multitude of  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=381) prophets from God in Isaiah God  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=385) emphasizes that this special person will  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=387) be sent to those who trust in idols who  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=391) say to images you are our gods the whole  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=395) of Arabia at the start of Muhammad's  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=397) prophethood consisted of idol  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=399) worshippers again this cannot be a  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=401) reference to Jesus because his people  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=403) the Israelites were monotheists and not  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=406) Island worshipers  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=408) moreover Jesus explicitly told his  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=412) disciples to stay away from the  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=414) idol-worshipping Gentiles the exact  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=416) opposite of what God prophesized in  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=419) Isaiah the Gospel of Matthew tells us  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=421) that these twelve Jesus sent out with  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=424) the following instructions do not go  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=426) among the Gentiles  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=429) in Isaiah God states that this special  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=431) person will be a warrior and will go  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=434) forth as a mighty man he shall stir up  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=437) jealousy like a man of war he shall cry  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=440) yay roar he shall prevail against his  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=443) enemies throughout history God has dealt  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=446) sternly with those who are sent guidance  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=448) and persist in disbelief Prophet  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=451) Muhammad peace be upon him had to engage  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=452) in many battles with the  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=455) idol-worshipping enemies of God and  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=456) ultimately prevailed against them by  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=459) comparison Jesus did not triumph over  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=462) his enemies according to Christians he  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=464) was crucified by them moreover Jesus  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=466) wasn't interested in fighting he was not  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=469) a man of war he was a pacifist according  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=472) to the Bible he said such things as for  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=475) all who draw the sword will die by the  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=477) sword and my kingdom is not of this  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=480) world if my kingdom were of this world  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=482) then would my servants fight  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/hpny44O0eEQ?t=488) in Isaiah God gives us a list of
