**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The Bible is a library of books written over a period of a thousand years or more, by mostly unknown authors. Today, Christians still disagree about which books should be in the Bible. There are many different canons of the Bible, a biblical canon or a canon of scripture is simply a set of books which a particular jewish or christian religious community regards as authoritative scripture. The English word canon comes from the greek word canon meaning rule or measuring stick. Roman catholics think their bible should contain 73 books including the book of tobit the book of job the book of judith, i should say the first book of maccabees, the second book of maccabees, the book of wisdom, otherwise known as the wisdom of solomon and the book of sirach which is also called ecclesiasticus. Protestant Christians think the bible contains just 66 books and none of the books I've just mentioned are part of their bible.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('45')">0:00:45</a> which a particular jewish or christian religious
community regards as authoritative scripture and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('53')">0:00:53</a> the english word canon comes from the greek
word canon meaning rule or measuring stick
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('61')">0:01:01</a> roman catholics think their bible should contain
73 books including the book of tobit the book of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('68')">0:01:08</a> job the book of judith i should say the first
book of maccabees the second book of maccabees
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('75')">0:01:15</a> the book of wisdom otherwise known as the wisdom
of solomon and the book of sirach which is also
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('81')">0:01:21</a> called ecclesiasticus protestant christians think
the bible contains just 66 books and none of the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('89')">0:01:29</a> books i've just mentioned are part of their bible
then there are orthodox christians you get the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('96')">0:01:36</a> russian orthodox church the greek orthodox church
and so on they say the bible contains 78 books in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('104')">0:01:44</a> addition to one and two maccabees in the catholic
version they have three and four maccabees
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('110')">0:01:50</a> however the ethiopian orthodox church believes the
bible contains 81 books the highest figure of all
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('119')">0:01:59</a> and the ethiopian broader new testament canon
has eight additional books in addition to the one
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('126')">0:02:06</a> the canon we normally uh aware of it has the four
books of cynodos the two divisions of the book of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('133')">0:02:13</a> the covenant the ethiopic clement and the ethiopic
didascalia this is what they're called if you
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('141')">0:02:21</a> google uh the ethiopian new testament canon
you'll see all these books detailed and discussed
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('148')">0:02:28</a> now if we go back in time
uh to the codex sinaiticus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('153')">0:02:33</a> this is the oldest complete bible in the world
and it's uh in the british library uh just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('159')">0:02:39</a> a couple of miles from where i'm sitting
and it's a fourth century christian bible
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('165')">0:02:45</a> and the canon there reflects probably most closely
the roman catholic canon but in the new testament
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('173')">0:02:53</a> we find the epistle of barnabas and
portions of the shepherd of hermas
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> so these are two texts that no one today thinks
is the word of god but uh in the fourth century
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> uh they were accepted as the word of god so
it's not just a different but it's not just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('191')">0:03:11</a> a different bible we have today different bibles
teach different christian doctrines for example
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> the question whether it's permissible to seek the
intercession of the living for the dead and the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('204')">0:03:24</a> existence of purgatory there's an old testament
book called two maccabees this is accepted by the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('210')">0:03:30</a> catholic church and the orthodox churches but not
by the evangelical churches and if you look at 2
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('216')">0:03:36</a> maccabees chapter 12 verse 43 onwards this speaks
explicitly about the prayer of the living for
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('225')">0:03:45</a> the dead and it's where the roman catholics also
get the doctrine of the purgat of purgatory from
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> as i say this book is in the roman catholic and
the orthodox bible but is rejected by protestants
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('237')">0:03:57</a> and all evangelicals so when a christian
tells you you must believe in the bible
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('245')">0:04:05</a> you must always ask them which one there
are so many they teach different things
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('253')">0:04:13</a> given there is so much confusion amongst the
people of the book about their scriptures and what
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('260')">0:04:20</a> they actually teach what does the quran
say in response to this well according to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> muhammad assad's message of the quran
translated and explained by muhammad assad
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('273')">0:04:33</a> in verse 48 of surah number 5 it says and unto
thee o prophet we have vouchsafed this divine
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> writ setting forth the truth confirming
the truth of whatever there still remains
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('288')">0:04:48</a> of earlier revelations and determining what is
true therein judged then between the followers
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('296')">0:04:56</a> of earlier revelation in accordance with what
god has bestowed from on high and do not follow
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('303')">0:05:03</a> their errant views forsaking the truth that has
come unto thee so this passage seems to clearly
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('311')">0:05:11</a> imply that the quran as a criterion as a quality
control is to be used to discern what is true and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('319')">0:05:19</a> what is false in the scriptures of the people of
the book and to confirm the truth of what remains
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('327')">0:05:27</a> in those earlier revelations clearly implying
corruption and change and alteration of the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('333')">0:05:33</a> original scriptures given to moses and given to
jesus and so on so the quran is as a footnote here
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('340')">0:05:40</a> is is described as the determinant factor in
deciding what is genuine and what is false in the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('347')">0:05:47</a> earlier scriptures that's muhammad assad's note
so i hope that was of interest until next time
