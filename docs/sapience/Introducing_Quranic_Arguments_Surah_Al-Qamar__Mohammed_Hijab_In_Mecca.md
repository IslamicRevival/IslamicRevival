 introduces Qur'anic arguments, which are used to support points made in the Surah Al-Qamar. The Surah is full of repetition and similes, which characterize the style and linguistic field of the text. The main point of the video is that the human being is like a tree that is pulled out of the ground by an event that is cataclysmic, serious, or enormous.

* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=600)**  introduces Qur'anic arguments, which explain Surah Al-Qamar's ending in terms of its content and structure. Each Ayah contains references to Allah, and the ending of the Surah is symbolized by the abruptness of its rhyming and sound.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=900)* Discusses Surah Al-Qamar, in which Allah speaks to Prophet Mohammed about withdrawing from certain people because they will come home "humbled eyes" by the way. This Surah also discusses the concept of tashvih, or "perfect wisdom." points out that this concept is illustrated by the fact that insects are scattered about when the Allah tries to make them feel insignificant.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=1200)** The story of Noah is mentioned in the Quran to emphasize the insignificance of human beings. Noah's people rejected him and said he was a madman, and he was rebuked and threatened. The story of Noah is summarized in a short space of time and it emphasizes the importance of prayer and the effect of a prophet's supplication.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=1500)* Discusses the different relationships between Allah and humans, discussing how Allah is responsible for all of the Great Inventions humans have ever made, while humans are only responsible for the actions they themselves take.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=1800)**  introduces Qur'anic arguments, which state that Islam does not intend to destroy the non-Muslim population until they receive a prophet. This is important to remember because someone might think that because there are so many Christians in the world today, Islam must be a violent religion. Yanni is critical of this idea, pointing out that many Christians have memorized the Quran, something which he claims is not a common occurrence among religious people.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=2100)**  introduces Qur'anic arguments, which focus on Surah Al-Qamar.

The main point of the video is that the human being is like a tree that is pulled out of the ground by an event that is cataclysmic, serious, or enormous.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=3000)* Discusses the Qur'anic argument that if there is something rather than nothing, then it must be because God exists.  points out that the people of Samud were accusing Mohammed of being mad after he claimed to be a prophet, and then Allah gives them further evidence that he is a true prophet. If Mohammed were not a prophet, then it would be a lie for them to believe this.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=3300)* Discusses Surah Al-Qamar, which discusses the importance of parental guidance and admonishing children to pray. points out that if one's job is only to tell their children to pray, then the term "stubborn" would not be used. The Arabic words used in the Quran have specific meanings which are important to understand in order to properly raise one's children.  points out that today's world is full of challenges and that the easy thing to do is to do nothing, but to instead be mindful of what our Lord is saying through the Quran. urges viewers to remember the Quran and to be diligent in studying it.

* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=5400)**  introduces Qur'anic arguments, which are very powerful Hadith. The Hadith includes Muslims and non-muslims, and animals.

The arguments explain that the Prophet Mohammed was a truthful prophet who received guidance from Allah. The Prophet's followers, including the people of Quraish, were arrogant and rejected all of his signs. However, Allah punished them with a penalty that was greater than what they could have ever imagined.  also mentions the Battle of beta and predicts that the Muslims will win. This prediction is important because it shows that the faith of the Muslims is always correct.

C.S. Lewis, a famous Christian author, discusses this same verse in his book "The Bible." He claims that the Bible got the prediction wrong, and that the Qur'an is the only source that accurately predicts this event.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=6600)* introduces Qur'anic arguments, which he says are better than the evidences given by prophets in the past. He also discusses two views among scholars of the compilation of the Quran. One view says the Quran was compiled from the Prophet's companions, while the other view says it was compiled from Allah. Regardless of the source, the author says that this does not really matter because the content of the Quran is the same.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9nXw8hfds&t=6900)** argues that the Quran is structurally coherent, and that evidence points to Muhammad being the one who put it in its present order. They also mention that the existence of something rather than nothing necessitates the existence of a cause, and that this cause is God.

[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=144) structural currents of the Quran  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=150) yeah  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=153) yeah perfect so there's a there is a

[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=164) then you go closer and actually looks  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=165) like constellations because they relate  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=166) together in some different ways like

[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=285) legend for example that is mentioned  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=287) like there's a cosmological theme the  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=289) beginning it starts with a measure and  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=291) it ends it starts with kind of like a  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=292) legend a Shara is one of the it's one of  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=295) those and in the beginning  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=297) so there is a connection between the two  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=300) here we're still in the summer we're  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=302) still in the sky

[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=305) particular here the comma when you look  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=307) in the sky what you see you see the  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=309) legend on the drum and you see the  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=311) camera as well so it's a night time  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=313) theme  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=315) it's a nighttime theme you see so I  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=317) covered that when Chuck I'll come up so  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=319) the translation is the hour has drawn  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=321) near and the moon has been cleft asunder  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=323) we're talking about one of the Miracles  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=325) of the Prophet Muhammad which is in  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=327) Chicago all the splitting of this of the  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=329) karma now interestingly it's been used  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=332) on both sides of the argument here in  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=334) the world of apologetics some people  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=336) they come and say well actually this is  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=337) an argument for the prophet of prophet  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=339) Muhammad because they say that look I  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=343) mean this is one of the physical  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=344) Miracles you guys demand physical  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=345) Miracles it was witnessed by the sahaba  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=347) of the of the Prophet The Companions of  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=350) the prophet and so therefore I mean for  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=353) example look at the Christian tradition  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=354) the Christian tradition their strongest  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=355) Miracles or their strongest evidence is  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=357) other Miracles they say look Jesus done  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=359) this Jesus was resurrected this is their  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=361) strongest arguments I mean I was reading  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=364) a book  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=365) I think the guy's name is Lee Strobel  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=367) it's one of the ones that William Lane  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=368) Craig recommends one of the top guys  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=370) from the Christian world top guys and  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=373) one of the key arguments they always use  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=376) is the resurrection of Jesus Christ a  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=377) historical incident so imagine this is  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=380) the highest level of argumentation  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=381) historical incidence  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=383) and so here we have in Chicago we say  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=385) look you got you think you've got you  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=387) know Miracles we've got miracles and in  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=389) fact not only do we have Miracles our  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=391) Miracles are something which is  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=394) testified by sanit which is what has an  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=397) authentic transmission whereas your  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=399) Bible is not transmitted authentically  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=401) however they will say this and this is a  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=403) you know counter argument I want you to  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=404) be aware of it  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=405) they'll say look you know the moon if it  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=408) was sight it was really cleft asunder  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=411) and split into two surely there would  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=413) have been so many people that would have  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=414) seen this how how comes you know uh we  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=418) only find a few people that see see that  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=420) they see this and it's only in the  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=421) Arabian peninsula  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=422) you see the argument here they will say  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=424) that how comes it's only these people  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=425) here that have witnessed it why don't we  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=427) find so many scattered reports in  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=430) history now the answer is twofold  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=432) some people have attempted to find this  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=434) Indian Prince or this and that and  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=436) historical things which are problematic  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=438) are absolutely honest with you and say  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=440) the better answer is this what's the  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=443) population of the world today 8 billion  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=445) let's say eight billion that's 2022.  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=447) what was the population of the world 100  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=449) years ago  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=451) what about 1 billion  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=453) maybe less than that so the population  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=456) of the world has gone up almost 10 times  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=458) it's kind of 100 years now how the  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=461) question is what would be the population  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=462) do you think of the world we don't have  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=464) exact figures historical guess but what  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=467) do you think the population of the world  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=468) is going to be a thousand four hundred  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=470) years ago before globalization before  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=472) technological advancements before Planes  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=474) Trains automobiles maybe if we're lucky  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=476) if we're lucky 80 million the whole  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=478) world is a population of one country  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=480) which is not one of the biggest ones  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=482) you're lucky you get 80 million 100  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=484) million and I think that's an estimates  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=486) that's a fair guess now let's just say  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=488) for the sake of argument that you're an  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=489) Arabian Peninsula and it's night time  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=492) yes there are people that are obviously  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=493) going to sleep but then there are people  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=495) in countries where it's not even night  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=496) time yet like we know we're Saudi Arabia  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=498) now right what time is it here it's like  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=500) 8 10 yes okay what time is it in the UK  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=504) it is like you know I don't know five  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=506) o'clock or something maybe it's back up  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=507) now it's not a great example because  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=509) it's a short night but no but for the  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=511) most part of the year it will be night  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=514) time in one place and it'll be daytime  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=517) and another so they don't even see the  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=518) night  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=519) in Australia there wasn't even a  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=521) civilization there probably and if there  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=522) was they didn't see the night there are  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=524) places in the world they didn't even see  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=525) the night so the idea that okay of let's  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=528) say 80 million 100 million people maybe  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=531) 50 maybe 60 of people they won't even  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=534) seeing the night and the rest of the  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=536) people  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=537) okay they were omis  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=539) they weren't all historians because the  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=541) idea is that everyone's a historian  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=542) waiting to see the cosmos and the  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=544) question is I mean how long did this in  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=547) Chicago take place for how long do you  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=548) reckon it took place for five hours  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=550) three hours  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=551) it took place for a very short period of  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=553) time three seconds if I saw something or  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=556) I thought would be the moon going like  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=557) this  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=558) in three seconds I wouldn't think oh  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=561) yeah that happened then I would doubt  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=563) myself I'll say I think I saw something  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=564) but I'll go to you know my friend said I  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=567) saw the brother what you've been  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=569) drinking at that's what would happen I  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=571) mean that's the real situation so the  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=573) the strongest argument is I think our  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=575) argument we are saying that this  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=577) happened we have witness testimony all  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=579) of it is all of these kind of things and  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=582) it Rivals any of the strongest things  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=583) that these guys say they have for  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=585) example the Christian tradition  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=588) I want you to um and I was reading this  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=590) Surah and a very interesting thing about  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=592) the structure of the Surah  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=595) we talked about the structure  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=597) I'll tell you now out of break I'll  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=599) break the Ashley I'll ask you first  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=602) every Heir in this Surah  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=605) there's something significant about its  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=607) ending  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=608) I want to give you 30 seconds to try and  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=609) work this out look at each Surah  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=612) each eye and this is something  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=614) significant about the ending of each  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=615) area tell me tell me what you think it  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=617) is I'll give you one minute yeah  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=623) huh  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=633) this one ends with oh  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=640) yeah every single a I I've only well I  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=643) only recognized this the other day again  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=645) every Ayah in this Surah every single  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=648) one  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=649) films  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=651) now this is quite an interesting  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=653) situation because here if you heard how  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=655) this was being recited it's all very  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=657) abrupt  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=660) meaning it's all very choppy it's all  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=662) very simultaneous it's all very instant  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=664) it's all happening straight away and  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=666) what's the theme of it you'll you'll  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=667) find as we'll come to the end of the  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=669) Surah it's the ins is the simultaneurity  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=672) or it's a spontaneous nature or it is  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=675) the southern abrupt nature of what that  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=677) their judgment we're in there  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=681) it's going to happen more like one  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=683) second  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=684) this thing's gonna be one second it's  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=685) gonna come so look the structure of it's  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=688) almost onomatopoietic meaning it's  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=691) almost like the words and the the  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=694) rhyming  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=696) now it's meant to symbolize the content  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=698) of the Quran  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=700) and you'll find this is very regular  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=701) like it  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=702) sounds like a shaking  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=705) you know  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=706) yeah  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=707) it sounds like a whispering you see and  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=711) here it's all choppy why because you  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=713) want to get to the point quickly  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=715) you see  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=716) and you see subhanallah in the previous  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=717) Surah it was ending in an alif  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=721) and this one is  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=723) changing but it's similar at the same  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=726) time you'll see the similarity it  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=728) maintains some of the characteristic  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=730) Integrity of Allah and the style of it  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=732) but it's actually different and by the  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=734) way just on a side note this idea of the  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=737) Falafel or the ends of thesaurus ending  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=739) in a certain letter is something which  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=741) is very common in the Quran for example  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=742) every  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=745) Ayah ends with the alif except for one  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=747) air  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=748) which is the word Sabine in the third or  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=750) fourth air and the same thing which was  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=752) last up chapter 33 of the Quran every  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=754) Aya ends with L except for the same word  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=755) by the way  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=757) very interesting things  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=759) yes  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=762) small that's why I'm giving you the like  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=764) a smaller it's a bigger Surah but the  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=766) another one just because since we're on  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=767) the theme of it  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=769) Chapter 58 every single area has the  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=773) word Allah in it  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=775) every single area you can go and check  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=777) this out and try and prove me wrong huh  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=779) I'm saying every a every a has the word  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=782) a lot why because there's a there's an  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=785) on the air in that Surah which says he  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=791) got them or he he overpowered them so he  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=794) made them forget the mentioning of Allah  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=796) so in order to counteract the shaytan  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=798) Allah he puts Allah in each and every  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=800) Ayah  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=801) now tell me now imagine if a man here  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=802) the Prophet Muhammad  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=805) he is narrating this Sur instantaneously  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=808) sometimes he's narrating them as an  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=809) answer to certain questions  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=811) so he's not doing it Yani he doesn't  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=813) have time to write and edit and send it  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=815) to the editor and see this and that  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=818) so how could it be I mean it's too  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=820) detailed it's too complicated it's too  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=823) precise and this is what we say  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=826) yeah  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=828) let them bring something like it  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=831) try and bring something like this  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=832) structurally linguistically rhythmically  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=835) syllabilistically historically  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=838) this is the challenge when you start to  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=840) realize that the challenge is no joke  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=842) here it's a serious challenge  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=844) and imagine they weren't able to meet us  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=846) so we'll go to the next um  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=848) yes change phones  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=851) you want to change  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=858) that's why I'm saying but they're saying  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=859) it's only the same tradition yeah  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=866) and if they see a sign they turn away  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=868) and say it says continuous Magic  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=872) in the previous Surah this was the same  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=873) allegation  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=876) but here there's once again they're  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=878) saying it's magic which shows it's an  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=879) admission of what what did we say it was  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=881) the mission of who remembers  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=883) if you're saying something is magical  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=885) what does what does that mean yes  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=888) you're admitting to the supernatural  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=891) external extraordinary remarkable nature  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=893) of the thing  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=895) and this theme continues  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=898) you see Allah  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=901) he's removed this idea that he could be  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=904) here is saying no they're the ones  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=908) double  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=914) they belied him whatever why did they do  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=918) that what's the reason psychologically  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=920) because they want to follow their  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=921) hedonistic desires  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=924) because they know Islam is a religion  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=926) you need to do had you need to do  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=929) fasting years they're praying this is  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=930) headache for them I'd rather just drink  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=932) candy and eat like an animal yes  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=941) uh each chapter like relates to the  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=943) other but then what someone brings the  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=945) argument that okay the quran's like that  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=947) because it was compiled like that yeah  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=949) I'll come to that okay just remind me  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=951) yeah don't forget  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=953) foreign  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=957) and every matter will be settled every  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=960) single matter will be settled yeah  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=964) and indeed there has come to the news  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=967) wherein there is  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=969) enough warning to check them from evil  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=971) in other words  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=973) this is interesting because especially  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=975) in remember this Ayah it's a number four  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=976) yeah this is going to come about when we  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=981) have a discussion about home loot in  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=982) particular and this is a very very  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=984) important discussion for today's world  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=986) because as we'll find  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=989) you know the Allah says to Prophet Lord  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=993) yeah he says the prophet Lord that he'd  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=995) done something that he was successful in  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=998) doing something and this is connected to  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1000) that so just bear that in mind  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1003) a perfect wisdom  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1006) but the Warner's benefit not them not in  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1009) other words people come this is perfect  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1011) wisdom it makes sense but these guys  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1014) they're not interested in it  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1017) so now Allah is telling the prophet  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1019) speaking to him directly says  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1021) withdraw from these people  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1025) and this time  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1028) keep coming in two in two times in one  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1030) hour have happened before as well  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1036) even the the fact that you have certain  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1039) letters that are this wasn't two sutures  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1041) ago here you have  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1045) um  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1050) to something which is terrible  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1053) it's the same kind of Reflections as we  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1056) had  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1058) so now it's the punishment being  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1060) mentioned  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1062) that they will come home forward with  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1064) humbled eyes  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1070) by the way in this Surah this term  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1074) keeps coming up is as if as if simile to  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1078) simile in in English language in Arabic  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1080) language is the same thing you have my  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1081) jazz and you have you have a simulator  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1083) you have a metaphor  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1085) if you say someone is like someone else  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1088) a metaphor if I say this man he is a  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1092) lion yeah and if I say I went into the  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1093) mosque and I saw someone  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1096) right  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1099) I saw a lion doing a hotbot on the  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1104) windward No One's Gonna think that  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1105) there's actual lion you know came from  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1106) the zoo  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1107) you're going to think it's Yani  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1109) it's a it's a brave man yeah  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1117) foreign  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1126) so this as if they are Locus spread of  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1129) uh abroad  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1131) Yani have you ever seen Locus how they  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1134) look especially when they're together  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1136) they look like they are yeah it looks  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1138) kind of  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1139) uh  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1141) it looks kind of um disturbing actually  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1143) horrifying yeah it looks kind of  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1145) disturbing it does they're scattered  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1147) about it's like muscle these insects and  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1149) sorry to say and you'll find this  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1153) speaking about human beings he always  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1155) uses insignificant  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1157) he brings them down and you're nothing  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1160) basically telling us you're nothing your  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1162) Muslim and non-muslim all of you are  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1164) nothing you're basically nothing you're  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1165) like insects you know how you see  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1166) insects I see you like that actually  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1168) worse than this we already spoke about  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1171) in the previous Surah I was talking  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1172) about how Allah he took the prophet  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1173) sallam to the high places and yeah  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1175) nothing compared to the Hulk of Allah  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1178) we spoke about that now imagine here  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1181) yes we're talking about his Allah is  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1184) trying to make us feel how insignificant  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1186) we are by presenting the insects as a  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1189) point of tashvi  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1192) insects don't even know where to go  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1194) don't know what to do have you ever  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1195) played a bat with an inset insect and  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1198) when I was a kid I used to see and that  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1200) going this way I used to put my finger  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1201) like that and then they used to go there  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1202) and put my finger down just playing  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1204) around with the insect and this is very  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1205) cruel I don't want to encourage it kind  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1207) of behavior  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1208) okay but the point is is that we  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1210) consider them easy crush this that throw  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1212) put my foot on them  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1215) it's a big foot as well smash them you  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1218) know whatever I mean  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1220) so the way we consider insects this is  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1222) how really we are we're insignificant  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1224) insect type and it's on the day of  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1226) judgment and subhanallah the day of  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1228) judgment had just been dominant and  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1230) stuff like that had your number if you  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1232) look at people in hajiramra even with  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1234) the two pieces of garments the like plus  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1236) and stuff like that as if as if they  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1238) come out of the graves actually because  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1240) this is the garments are meant to  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1241) signify as if you come out of the Grave  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1243) because you'll be wrapped with the same  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1244) garments  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1245) you know and you're there all of you and  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1247) you see it from the bird's eye view even  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1248) we have now on TV how it looks like you  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1250) don't even know who's who  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1253) and by the way the Americans they use  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1255) this kind of uh programming to the  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1258) foreign policy  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1260) because they look like yeah these people  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1261) here look at all of them it's so easy  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1263) when you have a distance to dehumanize  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1265) press the button you know you press they  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1266) don't care about every single one is a  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1268) human being like so in a sense Allah is  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1270) showing us you're nothing  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1272) you see and on the day of just but  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1273) you'll you'll realize that Hasting  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1275) towards the caller do this Believers  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1277) will say this is a hard day  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1279) they will admit that time it's a hard  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1280) day ending  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1284) now we're going into the stories  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1291) the people of Noah denied there before  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1294) them  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1296) their messenger they rejected our slave  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1298) and said he's a madman and he was  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1299) insolutely rebuked and threatened  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1302) now the story of Noah has mentioned is  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1305) mentioned  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1306) in many different parts of the Quran  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1308) he's one of the most mentioned uh  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1310) Messengers in the Quran  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1314) but here is very interesting because  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1316) it's kind of summarizing  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1318) everything in an evil Anka boat actually  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1321) it's summarizing many different things  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1323) in in short space of time  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1325) so firstly it's telling us what his  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1327) people said about him  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1328) and we know he was around for a very  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1330) long time  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1331) okay with his people  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1333) fantastic yeah  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1335) he said  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1337) he he evokes his daughter I have been  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1339) overcome so help me  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1341) he made Dua and then here is  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1348) it happens as a result when a prophet  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1351) makes a Dua it's a very different kind  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1353) of level of God  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1355) he made a law against them and he said I  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1357) am overcome I've had like in a sense  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1360) I've had enough so help me which shows  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1364) you that  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1365) we can all make such a Dua that when we  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1368) feel overcoming our own lives when we  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1369) feel like things are too difficult it's  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1372) too much unbearable  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1375) that we should make a similar to that  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1377) like all of the prophets if you look at  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1379) their their they have a very similar way  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1381) of doing it  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1382) Allah  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1388) and all the prophets have a way of of  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1390) doing it  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1396) the Gates of Heaven with a water pouring  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1399) forth yeah and it rains started to come  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1401) down  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1402) thunderous rain  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1405) you know you imagine the scene  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1408) it's a very serious you know the war is  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1411) coming down and  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1412) it's flooding from the from the bottom  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1414) as well  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1416) this is a scale one of the scariest  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1417) things for human beings to see a tsunami  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1420) type situation we've seen tsunamis we've  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1422) seen how that looks like imagine a heavy  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1424) tsunami and a rain from the sky this is  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1427) serious  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1432) and we caused the Earth to gush forth  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1436) with springs so the Waters of the  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1438) heavens and earth met for MATA predis  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1441) distant  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1443) and this word comes up in the Quran on  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1445) this very Surah many times actually  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1448) so once again there's repetition of  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1450) words sometimes to let you know that  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1453) no matter who you think you are and  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1454) we're talking about this in the previous  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1455) session we were saying like whoever who  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1457) you think you are whatever civilization  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1459) you have been able to construct  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1462) you're really insignificant  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1464) all it takes is one command and I'll  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1465) destroy you and flatten you in one  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1467) second  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1468) but once again as modern people we  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1470) should be very well aware of that  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1471) because we have nuclear weapons of mass  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1473) destruction  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1474) we've actually seen  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1475) whole cities and towns be destroyed with  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1478) one button with one human being pressing  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1480) a button imagine in the Second World War  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1483) you had Hiroshima Nagasaki yeah two  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1486) cities in Japan all it took was a person  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1488) to do that human being and then the  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1490) whole place was flattened out and if you  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1492) think a human being can do that press a  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1494) button and then flatten out human beings  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1496) like I'm insects  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1498) then imagine if you don't believe Allah  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1500) can do that  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1501) if a human being can do it then what  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1503) about Allah he can flatten you out in  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1505) less than these times  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1506) and in a way which is more  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1509) you know it's more grueling it's more  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1510) punishing it's more humorous than that  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1516) and we carried him on a ship made of  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1519) plaits and nails why did Allah mention  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1521) planks and Nails he's showing that this  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1524) insignificant things  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1526) which human beings use Allah  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1530) can help his profit using these things  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1532) to create an invention  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1534) like a ship which can withhold such a  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1536) situation and I actually believe  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1539) and this is something interesting  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1540) actually my children sometimes they ask  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1543) me who invented this thing like this  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1545) building here who made it and we've got  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1547) to be careful with the answer here  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1548) because there's two answers in one sense  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1550) we the human beings invented yes but  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1552) there is Allah invented it because  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1556) he created you and what you do whatever  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1558) good we do  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1560) we should ascribe that to Allah he  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1563) created us did you know so in a sense  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1565) indirectly Allah created  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1568) us  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1569) our actions even he he invented the  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1572) things we invented everything Allah is  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1574) responsible for  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1576) well there's a difference between  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1577) because I mean he'd done all the bad  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1579) things as well because I know what you  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1581) know the thought process is going to be  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1582) this is  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1583) the created you actions that you've done  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1584) your actions  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1586) and this distinction is a very important  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1588) one that even Tamia mentions  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1590) he has a whole  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1593) section on it on the eighth volume  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1596) the eighth volume he just speaks about  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1598) these kind of things and he speaks about  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1600) how this works and basically in the  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1603) eighth volume of much Michael Patel he  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1605) he makes this distinction an important  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1607) distinction where he says that  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1609) on the one hand Allah creates everything  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1612) including your actions and everything  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1614) you've done Allah is the creator of it  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1617) yes but he does not do everything  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1618) including your actions let me be  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1621) provocative a bit  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1622) sorry to say Let Me Be provocative I'm  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1624) going to be very provocative in this  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1626) session because he's going to be talking  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1627) about different groups and different  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1629) issues but let me let me start the  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1631) qualification if I say that there's a  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1633) rapist Daniel or a you know a thief  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1637) say you say didn't you say that Allah is  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1640) responsible and he created the thing and  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1642) he invented it how the atheist may say  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1644) well you want to have it your way when  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1646) it comes to the good things but what  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1647) about the bad things huh how about that  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1649) one I say listen  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1651) two things number one  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1653) it's impossible for Allah to do those  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1655) things anyway  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1656) why because Yani for example let's take  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1659) an easy example theft what is theft  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1662) theft is to say something it doesn't own  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1663) to you  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1667) because he owns everything  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1670) so theft is not even applicable to Allah  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1672) so that's from one General another Janet  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1675) another idea is  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1677) that this distinction between we are the  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1680) doers of the action Allah is the creator  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1682) of it he's got an indirect relationship  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1684) with that action  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1687) he has an indirect issue with that  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1689) action  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1690) but he has a direct relationship in the  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1692) creation of that action this is an  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1693) important distinction so when something  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1696) bad we do something bad that's because  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1697) we've done it  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1698) we're to blame for it did Allah create  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1701) the bad things yes he created everything  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1703) but what is bad anyway  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1705) and this is another discussion for  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1706) another day which we can't go into  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1708) details but some said that doesn't exist  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1711) even tell me I had that view uh Aquinas  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1713) had that view Thomas Aquinas a Christian  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1716) guy  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1717) Augustine had that you said actually the  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1720) bad thing is just the the lack of the  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1722) presence of the good thing  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1724) foreign  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1731) anyway that's another discussion for  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1733) that but the point I'm making to you is  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1734) Allah is responsible for all of the  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1737) Great Inventions anybody has ever made  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1739) at any time in human history  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1742) and it's ironic that we use those  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1744) inventions to feel like we feel  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1746) self-sufficient  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1748) from Allah and we say look what we've  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1750) created look what we've done we've done  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1752) this big building here we've got this  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1754) clean streets here  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1757) and in a sense that makes us feel like  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1760) we are Everlasting or Eternal creatures  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1763) Immortal creatures  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1765) but actually even that Allah is  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1767) responsible foreign  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1772) floating under our eyes a reward for him  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1776) who has been rejected  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1780) we have left as a sign then is there any  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1783) that will remember or receive admission  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1789) then how terrible was my torment and  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1793) warning  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1795) Allah doesn't destroy a people until he  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1797) sends them a message  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1802) that he does not destroy your people  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1804) until he sends him a messenger and this  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1806) is very important because someone will  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1808) say well there's so many people in the  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1809) world today they're Christian they are  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1811) you know they're this they're that but  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1813) they have never heard the message of  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1814) Islam or in fact they may have heard the  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1816) message of Islam but it might have been  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1817) distorted  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1818) Yanni or their mouth all they know about  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1820) Islam is that Islam is a religion of  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1822) terrorism is it fair that they will be  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1824) put into the Hellfire the Islamic cancer  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1826) is no it's not actually Fair  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1828) and that's why Allah says  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1831) we're not going to destroy them until we  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1834) send them  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1834) a prophet  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1837) and so  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1841) because if you really think about it  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1845) you know he says  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1855) yeah that when Allah took from a pledge  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1858) or Covenant from the people of the  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1860) children of Adam he took a covenant from  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1863) them am I not your road and they say yes  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1864) we are  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1866) so in other words we have this fitra or  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1868) this thing we have this thing  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1871) this idea of Iman already in US embedded  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1875) software  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1877) yeah for example a child  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1879) a baby  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1881) a toddler  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1883) whatever happens he knows kind of who  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1885) his mom is he knows he has a mum  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1887) he knows the idea of motherhood all  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1890) these things are  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1891) clear in the mind of the child  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1893) and what we're saying is that the same  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1895) thing the filter is the same thing as  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1896) this  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1897) you see  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1898) it could have been sufficient for Allah  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1900) to destroy us  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1901) because we're not going we're not even  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1902) searching for the future we're not  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1904) searching for Allah  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1906) but Allah he made a condition which is  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1909) that you have to hear it first so that  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1911) you come back to the truth  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1914) so when you hear these  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1916) punishments and stuff you have to put it  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1918) in that context  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1919) that we put it in the context of they  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1921) were sent a messenger and they have a  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1923) photograph two things they are well  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1925) deserving of that punishment why else  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1927) would they yes why else would they  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1930) reject the situation I would be reject  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1932) it the evidences are there all the  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1934) prophets came with some kind of evidence  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1938) and then Allah says yes  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1942) we have certainly made the Quran easy  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1945) to understand and remember then is there  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1948) anyone who remembers and this is itself  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1950) kind of a miraculous verse  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1952) the Quran is the most memorized book in  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1955) the world  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1957) of a science there's no other book I  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1959) have not I've met many Christians many  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1961) Jews in my life spoken with them debated  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1964) with them discuss with them I have not  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1966) met a single Christian or a single Jew  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1968) who has memorized the holy book  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1971) ever  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1974) to be honest with you I've never even  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1976) met somebody who has attempted it  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1980) have you I know why do you think that  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1982) that is what it's hard to even memorize  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1984) that stuff  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1985) yeah I mean what are you going to  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1986) memorize anyway is look at this listen  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1989) to this area look at look at the solar  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1991) we just told you like everything is so  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1992) rhythmic that I was reading a book by  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1994) some guy called Tony buesan a long time  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1996) ago how to remember oh memory the secret  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=1998) memory or something he said one of the  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2000) most important aspects of memory and  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2001) most people will tell you this  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2003) is risen  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2005) rhyme it's syllables there's all these  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2007) things  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2008) the the Bible's not fit for purpose as a  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2011) book to be memorized  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2013) neither is any other book a religious  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2016) book it's not take a look at it  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2019) take it I mean read it if the Genesis is  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2021) a story it's a fable like yeah  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2023) for example Genesis chapter six or  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2026) chapter nine the whole thing is the  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2027) whole thing is he was the son of him he  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2029) was the son of him he was the son of him  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2031) what kind of information is that it's  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2033) like you're going to the Future  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2034) Euro or something and getting someone's  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2036) answer and retest or something  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2038) it's not something to be memorized yes  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2040) what's wrong with that  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2042) that it's not a book to be memorized I'm  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2044) we're not saying there's anything wrong  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2045) with it we're just saying that because  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2047) the question is  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2050) saying that he has made the Quran easy  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2052) to remember so so this is a this is  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2055) something  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2056) special about the Quran and you'd expect  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2058) for a book which is meant to contain the  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2062) words of God  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2064) to be implemented to be spread  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2068) to be easy to memorize because if not  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2071) then anyone can change it anyone can  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2073) it's part of the preservation mechanism  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2076) it's hard  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2077) sorry go first go first I mean do you  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2079) think it's hard to memorize it because  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2080) it was changed like they put some things  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2082) that are not from God exactly exactly  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2086) guys let's uh let's try and keep it down  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2088) please yeah  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2090) let's try and keep it up  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2092) yeah so as I was saying it's uh yeah I  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2095) mean it could be sorry it could be yeah  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2096) because it was changed it could be  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2098) because it was changing and because it  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2100) was not only just changed like let me  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2102) get I'm not gonna go into deep detail  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2103) about this but like for example the Old  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2105) Testament one of the main sources of it  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2107) is a Greek Source the Septuagint it's a  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2110) Hebrew Book they have to translate it  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2112) from Greek to Hebrew first  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2115) Johnny this is the problem of not having  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2117) a book that's easy to memorize if you  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2119) don't have a book that's easy to  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2120) memorize then it's then you rely on even  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2123) another language Source it's another  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2125) language imagine if I say to one of the  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2127) earliest qurans is is in this place or  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2129) that place and it's in it's in French or  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2132) another language  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2134) William the French is relatively new  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2136) let's say a language access at a time  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2139) Hebrew and I had to translate it from  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2142) Hebrew to Arabic  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2143) first  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2144) then you rely on the translator you rely  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2147) on this and you're right there you  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2148) cannot compare the Quran with any other  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2150) book full stop  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2152) but the fact that Allah keeps repeating  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2154) this  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2156) itself is is kind of as if he's trying  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2158) to encourage us to memorize the Quran  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2160) because  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2161) doesn't just mean understand it it means  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2165) remember it  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2168) yes yeah and like you said earlier about  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2171) this  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2172) he was like a warrior he was under  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2175) similar to the Quran people can always  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2177) say oh so what for each individual  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2179) aspect but they're missing the whole  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2181) picture like it's compounded like  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2182) probabilities okay I flip heads once I  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2185) can't clip heads 506  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2187) 000 billion times and get heads always  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2189) it's like there's something else going  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2191) on if I made a YouTube video  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2193) for 30 40 hour long video yeah  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2198) I've never done that I don't plan to do  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2200) that but let's say I do a 40 it takes  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2202) about 30 hours to recite the Quran the  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2205) whole thing 30 to 40 hours let's just  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2207) say 35 hours  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2208) I'll make a 35 hour video I claim to be  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2211) wherever I claim to be yeah  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2214) and then that whole video is memorized  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2217) a thousand years later  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2219) by a quarter of the you know not a  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2221) quarter of the world but a big chunk of  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2222) millions of people  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2223) what kind of success would you call that  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2225) video  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2226) do you see yeah it's the most successful  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2228) video of all times  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2230) if I if I made a 25 30 hour 35 hour  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2234) music track  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2235) there's not one musician one poet  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2239) one you know astounding  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2243) writer of literacy Shakespeare anybody  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2246) who's ever achieved anything like that  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2249) how could that not be worthy of notes  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2252) my question to the fair-minded Cafe  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2255) is you cannot tell me this is not worthy  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2258) of note because well like if you had  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2260) been the if you have been the author of  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2262) it you would know that it's worthy of  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2264) notes  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2266) there's no other book in the world that  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2268) has actually achieved that  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2269) it has an Accolade that no other book  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2273) has and that's an empirical thing  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2276) it is a sociologically empirical thing  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2279) it's a historical thing it's a  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2280) cross-cultural thing  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2282) you can't lie out you can't um uh  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2285) distort the faculty  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2286) the Quran has an Accolade which no other  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2289) book has which is it's the most  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2292) memorized book in human history  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2296) so what  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2300) it's not what they say when they're  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2302) watching  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2303) Netflix shows  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2305) because they look at the ones that  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2306) everyone recommends everyone wants or  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2308) the movies that everyone watch what  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2310) everyone uh watches these things there's  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2312) something called the perito principle  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2314) which is that I don't know what exact  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2316) percentages are but let's just have a  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2318) sake of argument two percent of people  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2320) make 98 of the content  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2323) yeah and if I ask you the question  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2327) who makes the majority of music in the  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2329) world really so 100 people getting 100  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2331) people 150 people today and living human  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2333) beings  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2335) how many people are doing music  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2338) so many people  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2339) how many A-list celebrities are the  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2341) highest level out there  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2343) 300 maximum  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2345) highest level 100  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2346) I'm not going to say anything more than  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2347) that now what I'm saying is is that not  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2350) significant of course it's significant  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2351) Society has hierarchized that as  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2354) something which is significant otherwise  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2356) when you walk in the street and when I  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2358) will conestrate it's the same thing I'm  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2359) joking no but that's the idea you see  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2363) Society rates Things based on views  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2365) based on effects based on that I'm  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2368) telling you this book is the most  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2370) memorized book  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2372) in the history of the world  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2374) and there's there's no there's no second  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2376) place  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2377) of a size  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2379) there's no second place  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2380) so this is a it's an Evidence  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2383) for the veracity of Islam and if someone  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2385) says it's not well they are deluding  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2388) themselves  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2392) yes  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2393) important I kind of know the question  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2395) but they just want to look down so that  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2397) they want to hear it from you how  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2399) important is memorizing Quran  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2402) um  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2403) today to the person in doubt I know it's  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2406) very important like significantly you  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2408) don't need to do that but how much do I  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2411) invest okay that's gonna discoke this  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2414) and I don't wanna hold on to that  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2416) question like his one yeah just hold on  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2417) to it and if we have time at the end  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2419) I'll have to deal with that  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2421) but one more thing linguistically  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2423) stylistically this is a question that is  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2426) continually awesome  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2428) foreign  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2454) have a question continually asked that's  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2457) a stylistic feature of the Surah  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2459) the next to a lot you have one question  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2461) continually ask as well  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2462) so this the stylistic feature of this  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2465) Surah which in a sense is continues to  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2467) the next  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2469) cancel  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2473) by the way  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2476) and how terrible was my atonement and my  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2478) warnings  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2484) this is the second time has been used in  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2487) the Quran  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2488) verily we sent down  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2491) Furious wind  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2494) of a harsh  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2495) voice on the day of evil Omen and  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2498) continuous calamities Bill mouthful this  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2500) translation  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2501) but we have something look all the  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2503) elements are being described first we  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2505) have the water  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2507) if you think about it right yeah the  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2508) water it destroys Allah  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2512) Allah  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2514) only knows  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2517) the water we use it for drinking for  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2519) living without it we wouldn't be alive  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2527) but you use it to destroy the people  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2529) likewise  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2532) now we're going to the Furious when the  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2534) loud noise that destroyed other people  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2537) so you're moving from element to element  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2539) meaning you don't even know where it  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2541) could come from which goes back to the  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2543) theme of simultaneurity instant abrupt  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2546) endings and all these kind of things you  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2548) don't know how this fight is going to  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2549) end  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2550) you don't even know  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2554) you know you could be you swallowed up  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2556) it could be your bird it could be this  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2558) it could be unlocking the stream  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2559) whatever he wants you think this is  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2560) something which is only applicable to oh  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2562) this is a as well in  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2565) look at for example how people die go to  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2568) your country and how people die on a  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2570) yearly basis  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2572) I was on cancer research website some  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2574) time ago  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2576) and I read something on there which I  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2579) found quite disturbing  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2582) it said one in every two people will die  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2584) from cancer  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2586) and I thought this must be a super  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2588) inflation or some kind of caricature but  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2592) then they said no actually what is is  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2593) that most of these people are going to  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2594) be over the age of 65 and they're going  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2596) to die from cancer how many cancers are  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2598) there is Leukemia are the skin cancer  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2600) there's  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2601) all kinds of cancers sound  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2604) so we think we're safe  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2606) we have a man that we believe  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2609) we think that is not there a luck  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2613) industry one look at Comfort weapon  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2616) government shut themselves down and  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2617) we're all stay in our homes and stuff  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2619) like that and animals were in the  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2620) streets  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2622) well that's what happened and the things  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2625) were being unpolluted and these kind of  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2627) things  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2628) one one virus from some cow plant and  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2631) whatever it was in China move on  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2634) well this it was a battle Yeah that can  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2637) destroy all of us  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2638) one basket just for all of us first it  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2640) was one man that pressed the button that  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2642) was one but what's next  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2646) I'm saying yeah  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2648) the point is you can be destroyed from  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2650) anything cancer can hit you  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2653) and we have anxiety over things in life  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2655) because Allah  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2660) we have created the human being in a  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2662) sense in a state of anxieties  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2665) where essentially anxiety-ridden  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2667) creatures  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2668) yeah we have anxiety all the time oh  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2671) what's going to happen or what is going  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2673) to happen or is this good yeah I'm gonna  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2675) lose money and I can't get here and the  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2676) money's not gonna be enough and this and  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2678) that is not gonna get through school uh  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2680) actually I'm gonna get the grades and  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2681) I'm gonna get married and what if I  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2682) don't get married and what if I my kids  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2684) turns out disabled and what  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2688) what if you just died what if something  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2690) happened to you immortal Fajr what if  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2692) something yeah you drink or you walk the  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2694) street someone hits you someone stab you  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2697) someone shoot you you live in America  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2699) there's a shooting inside them  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2701) walk in the street  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2704) anything can happen  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2706) so there's a level of tawakul you have  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2708) to have  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2709) and there's also a level of fear of the  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2711) marker of Allah  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2713) you have to ponder over the consequences  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2715) that lack important place for you  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2717) these people they were walking as freely  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2719) as we were  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2720) you think they didn't drink and eat and  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2723) laugh and joke if you saw some people  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2725) from come north and I did a a  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2728) documentary on him maybe you'll feel  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2730) sorry for the guy  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2731) this was one of the guys walking and  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2734) he's got his kids and they're laughing  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2735) and smiling and then one day destroyed  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2737) why because he had the arrogance in him  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2740) he had um  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2742) he didn't care  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2744) they left he thought everything was okay  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2747) maybe we think everything is okay  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2751) and look at this  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2754) plucking out men as if they were  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2756) uprooted stems of day problems  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2760) once again so as I said this this Surah  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2762) is going to have continual mention of  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2766) and so on  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2768) similarly similarly similarly similarly  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2771) the Surah is filled with repetition of  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2773) the same thing and simile these are the  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2775) two things which characterize the style  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2777) and the linguistic uh lexical field of  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2781) this particular Surah  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2783) but look at the itself  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2786) because it's very I was thinking about  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2787) this actually I was thinking  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2792) you got trees  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2794) now a tree is very  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2797) firmly rooted into the ground  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2801) the What would  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2802) pull out a tree from a through some  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2805) cataclysmic event some enormous events  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2808) some serious event  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2812) but these trees  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2814) are being used  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2815) to describe the human being  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2818) because the human being thinks he's  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2821) stable he's okay  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2823) I've got enough money in the bank  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2827) he thinks his money has made him okay  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2829) now you see when when there's more and  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2832) more money in a society that Society  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2835) becomes less and less God-fearing  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2837) that's a strength  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2839) they don't need it around the flip side  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2841) I'm puke this is a correlation if you  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2843) see the most religious countries in the  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2845) world that War uh places where this wall  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2847) for example look at Somalia  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2850) look at one day when they answer about  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2852) the Sharia questions they usually get  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2854) very Afghanistan when they ask about  
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2855) Sharia question is very high would you  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2857) implement God's law yes yes and then  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2859) Pakistan yes  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2861) listen that yes Kosovo actually that's  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2864) they've changed they've got their own  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2865) situation I'm not going to mention  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2867) because they had to have a walk  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2870) but then when you ask the people in uh  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2872) England for example they don't even have  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2875) natural disasters  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2876) we don't even have natural disasters in  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2878) England  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2879) from time to time we're not in a  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2881) tectonic area is pretty safe for  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2883) countries to go honestly I'm not trying  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2884) to you know take you away from the gang  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2886) crimes and the shootings and all this  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2887) kind of things  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2888) you know  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2891) we've got snack Prime as well actually  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2894) but you think you're stable then you  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2896) think you're okay you're all right I'm  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2897) all right I'm doing okay yeah yeah yeah  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2899) whatever you know you're looking around  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2901) strutting and stuff  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2904) and then one day you get destroyed you  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2905) get humiliated  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2907) we've seen it in popular culture we've  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2909) seen it with celebrity culture we've  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2910) seen it with dictators we've seen it  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2912) with everything yet  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2913) because these people that why is Allah  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2916) comparing them with  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2918) these trees  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2919) because he is showing you that the tree  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2921) is stable or at least it seemed there  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2924) was the illusion of stability  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2927) all of us  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2931) only have an illusion of stability  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2935) and then he took them out of the ground  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2937) like they were  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2940) and once again this iron is coming out  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2944) it's almost roaring house  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2953) that how terrible was my torment and my  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2955) warnings  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2959) once again we have made the Quran easy  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2961) to remember for who's going to remember  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2963) it  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2964) who's going to remember it  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2967) and questions  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2969) in the previous sort of were commonplace  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2970) as well  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2973) actually this was in uh  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2977) um  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2981) or is it this or is it that is question  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2983) question which shows us what what do we  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2986) say about questions  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2989) it's a challenge it's a challenge but  
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2991) what is it why yeah I mean  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2993) you have an assertion I make a point and  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2996) you have a question is it their  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=2998) admission exploring yeah this is the  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3000) same  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3003) to think yeah so it makes you it makes  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3005) you think  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3006) yeah yes you said that sometimes it's  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3008) more powerful it's more powerful  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3009) sometimes because you always think about  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3012) follow the quranic method  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3014) if you ask someone a question sometimes  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3016) it's more powerful than making a point  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3019) for life  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3020) a question  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3022) can really shake somebody one question  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3024) just one question they'll say yeah I'll  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3027) give you one question now that you can  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3028) use in that one  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3030) and I've read some atheists saying about  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3033) this question  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3034) that it was one of the it haunted them  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3036) this question I'm going to give you some  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3039) and you'd be thinking why would this  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3041) question haunt an atheist  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3044) but think about that you'll see why  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3046) but obviously from a Muslim perspective  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3048) we may not appreciate it  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3050) the question is why is there something  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3052) rather than nothing  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3055) why is there something rather than  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3057) nothing  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3060) if the atheist  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3063) something yeah why is there something  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3064) not nothing that's like and it can make  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3066) him go mad  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3067) then he's going to try and what find an  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3069) explanation and the explanation is gonna  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3071) have to be what an ultimate cause and  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3072) that's it we've got God  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3074) on the as an option on the table yeah  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3079) so this is the question if we really  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3081) believe in Allah and you really believe  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3082) in this story  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3084) actually  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3086) people in history then with this Quran  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3088) easy to remember made it easy for you  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3092) so why don't you remember it  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3094) now we have samud also belite the  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3097) warnings foreign  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3103) as well these four sometimes a lot of  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3106) times are coupled together why because  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3109) they were so similar in their behavior  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3110) and their culture and their behavior  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3118) they said a man alone from Among Us that  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3121) we would follow  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3123) truly them would be error and in  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3124) distress or Madness  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3127) remember they were accusing him of  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3128) Madness  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3129) and now they're saying we would be mad  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3131) if we follow you  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3133) so they've changed the goal post a  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3134) little bit  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3136) but what's the problem with it I mean I  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3137) was thinking about this myself  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3142) if it's one person  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3145) why should we follow one man  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3149) say yeah  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3153) no I mean this is what the Quran these  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3155) guys yeah the people of samud yeah  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3157) they're saying should we fall why should  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3159) we follow one man  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3161) foreign  
[0:52:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3168) the idea is they don't want to just  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3172) follow one person  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3174) actually it's a herd mentality we're  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3176) seeing our father's doing this we're  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3178) seeing these people doing this well why  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3179) should we follow this one guy  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3181) what do you mean why should we follow  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3183) this one back  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3184) it's not a rational argument if you  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3186) think about their arguments is  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3188) it's a weak argument actually  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3194) and then they go further actually  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3196) foreign  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3210) from Among Us and by the way he was one  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3213) of the Arab Prophets  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3215) and they say and he is an incident liar  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3218) they're speaking about a prophet as he's  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3219) alive Allah  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3223) so as if Allah  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3225) they'll know tomorrow  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3228) Yanni later on they'll know  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3230) it's not exactly tomorrow but later on  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3232) they'll know who the liar is  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3234) which shows you something  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3236) they knew he was a true prophet  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3238) otherwise it wouldn't be a line  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3241) it would be taxi but it wouldn't be a  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3243) lie because why would it be a lie if  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3245) they actually believed that he wasn't a  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3247) prophet  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3248) so Allah didn't destroyed them just on  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3250) the basis  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3252) that they belied the prophet no they  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3254) they knew he was speaking  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3257) and then they rejected him  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3259) what kind of arrogance is this  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3262) and then Allah continues because even  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3264) after this Allah gives them additional  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3266) evidence  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3272) verily we are sending the she camel as a  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3276) test for them so watch them and be  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3278) patient and it's not worth  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3282) which is a lesser form of the word Sabah  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3288) seriously patient of it  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3297) same word is used here  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3299) that tell your your family to pray and  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3303) Be watchful over them man  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3305) it's not enough to tell your son or to  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3306) tell your daughter go and pray  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3309) you have to keep telling them to pray so  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3312) I've had enough I've told them already  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3313) no no because if your job was just to  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3316) tell them one time  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3317) he wouldn't have used such a strong term  
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3319) in the Quran your job as a parent is to  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3323) continually tell your parents your kids  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3325) to pray and your and your family  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3330) so this is the importance of the word  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3332) stubborn one part one letter changes the  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3336) dynamic completely this is why the  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3338) importance of the Arabic language  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3341) we have said this Napa this she camel  
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3345) as a fitness as some kind of a trial for  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3348) them  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3349) so watch them was established  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3353) all they're saying is do not kill he  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3355) says don't kill this this camel  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3359) uh yeah I mean what do you think about  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3360) it  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3361) that's the easy thing to do  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3363) all I have to do is nothing  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3368) I don't have to do anything  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3371) but imagine the arrogance  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3373) yeah imagine like they want to prove a  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3375) point  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3376) they're coming up  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3382) and even now I'm telling them look you  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3384) want to drink every one of you has your  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3386) turn  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3387) meaning you're still going to give them  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3388) provision Allah is  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3391) he gives a chance of the chance  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3394) look you want a drink you can drink  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3399) Fernando  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3400) this is the word that they use with the  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3402) Prophet Muhammad  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3404) remember in the previous Surah Allah  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3409) your friend did not did not go astray  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3411) the same language is being used now of  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3414) the previous prophet  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3415) they liked him they liked the guy can  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3418) you imagine this you have a friend of  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3419) yours yeah if you got my friend of yours  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3421) good friend I want you to imagine one of  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3423) your best friends  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3424) yes and now he's telling you some very  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3427) important thing to him  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3429) and you know he's a community of people  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3431) maybe it's 500 a thousand two thousand  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3433) we don't know what the population of  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3434) that kind of places  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3435) he's telling them please you know this  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3437) is something I'm  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3438) he's a friend of this  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3440) and all he's saying is don't kill this  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3446) he's not even telling us to give the  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3447) money nothing just don't kill this one  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3449) here  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3450) and he said  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3452) they gave a sword to this one guy he  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3454) killed the camera  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3456) this is wrong with these people  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3458) well like what's wrong with these people  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3459) you feel that they're sick in the mind  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3461) when you think about them what the hell  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3463) is wrong with you  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3465) why would you do that yeah  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3468) and imagine they know he's a true  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3470) Prophet what kind of Africans because  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3472) remember  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3475) they believe he's a true prophet  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3479) and he's telling them don't kill this  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3481) one and they kill him  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3482) they give them they all give them like  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3484) like a ceremony they're giving him a big  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3486) sword to kill the camel no one's saying  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3488) stop stop don't kill her you don't know  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3490) what could happen to us  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3491) although these people are sick in the  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3493) mind  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3494) but we think that this is an ancient  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3496) story which doesn't have any application  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3497) today well life is has so much  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3500) application today  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3502) people are sick in the mind  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3504) they have now deluded themselves into  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3506) thinking that they're in control of the  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3508) world  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3510) they're offended  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3513) when we say that you have to there's a  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3514) control above your own desires they're  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3516) offended by it  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3518) they are offended  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3522) every one of them  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3525) so how was how terrible was My  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3527) Punishment and my warnings  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3529) and that tells us what it is  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3536) we sent them a single site  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3538) which is like a torment or an awful cry  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3541) and they became like dry stubble  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3544) of fold Builder now this is a very  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3546) horrible translation let me just change  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3547) up  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3549) basically in the farmer when he gives  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3551) food to the animal and it crunches up  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3554) it's like now you're not even like an  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3556) insect or an animal you're like the food  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3557) that the animal eats yeah you're crushed  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3560) up your crumbs of the earth you're  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3561) nothing  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3563) so imagine that you you thought you're  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3565) all this now you're just like some  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3566) crumbs on the ground  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3567) you you're going You're sick-minded  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3569) people coming out stabbing the the the  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3571) shoe camel  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3573) you're coming out you're hurting your  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3575) friends feelings  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3576) going you know who's the true Prophet  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3577) you're doing all this stuff now you're  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3578) nothing you're you're a footnote in  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3580) history  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3582) you're in the trash heap of History  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3587) we have made  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3588) the Quran easy to remember so who's  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3590) going to remember it now we're going to  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3592) come Lord and I'm going to spend a  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3594) little bit more time with him I've done  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3595) this on purpose because I feel like this  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3597) is very applicable to us not like the  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3599) other ones weren't I actually think that  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3601) all of the Russell when they came to  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3604) their people and all of the problems  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3605) that they had  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3606) today's age is almost like a combination  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3609) of all of those problems  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3613) so like for example  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3614) uh  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3615) uh the the  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3617) crystals and and the the you know  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3621) business fruit basically  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3623) some prophets came with that some  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3625) prophets came with blue art or was  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3627) referred to Miss Lee yeah  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3629) whatever  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3631) LGBT community and not just that it's  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3633) what they come with the ideas that they  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3635) come with which we're going to speak  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3636) about in detail some detail here  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3638) everyone's going to wake up please  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3642) okay well I'm saying is that yummy  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3646) all of the prophets oh I believe for us  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3649) so when we're looking at these we should  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3651) be looking at how we should be giving  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3652) dollar to  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3653) homosexuals  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3656) because this is  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3658) and obviously there's one sort of money  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3660) uh that speaks about Commodore let's get  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3662) involved the first thing that Allah says  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3664) is  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3668) that we sent them a violent tornado  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3672) with showers of stones which destroyed  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3674) them except for Luke's household  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3677) uh that we delivered them by early Dawn  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3680) we know from the other parts of the  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3681) Quran that in fact the wife of Lord  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3684) was destroyed as well some officers even  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3686) say that she was joining the lgbtq  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3689) and there is some indication that she  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3691) was herself lesbian  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3694) how's this the case yes maybe  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3697) some some indication there she joined  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3699) them  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3700) and she was destroyed actually and  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3702) imagine subhanallah imagine this is a  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3704) this is a wife of a prophet  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3708) so sometimes some of us man and woman  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3711) I'm not this is not a general specific  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3712) issue because in the Quran you have a  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3714) man example of that  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3715) which is it there's two main examples  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3722) you know that they were underneath two  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3725) righteous like enslaves and then they  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3727) betrayed them  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3729) and then you have  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3730) who had a very horrible husband  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3733) so sometimes you can have a great person  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3735) she was seen as one of the best people  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3737) of all time actually  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3739) the wife of firoud but she had one of  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3742) the worst people of all time as a  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3743) husband likewise this is one of the best  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3746) people of all time we had one of the  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3748) worst women of all time as his wife  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3750) so you never know it's always not sleep  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3752) you cannot control all the variables who  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3756) you married is that  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3757) I mean imagine someone coming to Luther  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3759) and say look how comes you married this  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3761) woman here and he is mother or his  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3764) auntie or something how could you not  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3766) know this beforehand  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3767) and look at her how's your behavior  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3769) Annie  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3770) the point is  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3772) you can't control the hearts of mankind  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3774) people will go straight your kids could  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3777) go straight your family could go astray  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3779) your spouse could go straight  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3781) and if it happened to the prophets could  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3783) happen to all of us we're all  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3785) susceptible to this point  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3787) this is fasting  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3789) so Allah says obviously this is  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3792) referring to the fact that the najat  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3794) that has been referred to not the  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3796) destruction  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3797) that it's a Grace from upon us that  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3799) Allah saved these people  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3802) that the the people of Lord he saved  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3806) them and that's  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3808) and we talked about gratitude previous  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3811) Surah and it shows you how important  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3813) gratitude is we will reward the people  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3817) that that not just praise Allah but  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3820) thank Allah  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3821) with a removal of Affliction it's very  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3823) important which shows you that from the  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3826) benefits of doing chakra of Allah  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3828) is  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3829) the removal of affliction  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3832) and this is what Allah said  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3834) he said put together all of the  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3837) blessings of Allah  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3839) with the Gratitude of Allah is what he  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3842) said  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3843) the Quran also says  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3845) if you're thankful I'll give you more so  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3847) two main things that the Quran is  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3849) telling us that you'll get as a benefit  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3850) in this Dunya for doing gratitude number  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3853) one is that you'll be saved from  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3854) Affliction and number two that Allah  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3855) will give you more blessings  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3857) so this shows you the power of sugar  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3861) and that extends as we know to the Hulk  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3864) because  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3868) whoever doesn't thank the people has not  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3870) thanked Allah  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3872) so this is the importance of sugar  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3876) and  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3878) a lot did warn them of our punishment  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3881) but they disputed about the warning  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3883) now this is very important  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3885) I was thinking about this for some time  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3890) this shows you the minimum requirement  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3891) of Dao of homosexuals  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3894) that you have to at least warn them of  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3896) the consequences  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3898) because what did Allah praise the Lord  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3900) for him he said  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3902) uh what do I just say  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3906) we he did warn them  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3910) so they didn't pay attention to it the  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3912) point is this is that Allah is praising  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3915) Lord  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3917) he is praising him for telling them the  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3920) consequences of their homosexuality  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3924) now a lot of people in Tower they don't  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3925) even want to mention the consequences of  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3927) homosexuality they'll say it's Muslim  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3931) in America  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3933) yeah I don't mind mentioning names we  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3935) have to tell the truth  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3936) like they'll make this they don't speak  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3938) to homosexuals in a way that lot spoke  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3940) to his people  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3941) this is the biggest criticism and it  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3943) could be the Achilles heel of that  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3944) organization  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3945) because Lord he told the people at least  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3950) he said that you know uh  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3955) are you coming to the men with desire  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3959) this stuff you don't find it in some  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3961) aspects of American dawah at all is  
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3962) absent  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3964) in fact if someone did that I promise  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3966) you part of the community would reject  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3967) him but say this guy is being too rough  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3969) with that with the homosexuals no it's  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3971) not being rough he's doing exactly what  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3972) the prophets do  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3974) now it doesn't mean that's the only  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3975) thing you do  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3976) because that's not the only thing Luke  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3978) did and I'll give you an acronym here  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3981) that can help doing that autism I've  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3983) made This Acronym myself  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3985) see  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3987) stands for consequences the first thing  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3989) with homosexual that you should do is  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3991) tell them the consequences  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3993) now the consequences are divided into  
[1:06:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3995) two  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=3997) this life and the Hereafter this life  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4000) there's undoubtedly studies that show  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4003) homosexual parenting they produce kids  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4006) that have pathology psychological  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4007) pathologies it creates for example  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4010) homosexual people by almost all studies  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4013) that have ever been done including the  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4015) NHS National Health Service you know in  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4017) England the main body they say that they  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4019) have 10 times 10 to 15 times more likely  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4022) to to contract  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4025) a sexually transmitted disease than a  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4028) normal person  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4029) you can easily make a consequentialist  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4031) communitarian argument that what you're  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4032) doing is affecting the whole Community  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4034) we shouldn't allow this thing  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4036) yeah you can ease it's the easiest  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4038) argument that you can make  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4040) it affects your children it affects your  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4042) bodies it affects everything bad is  
[1:07:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4044) everything bad  
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4047) but that's not the only thing we should  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4048) do obviously we believe in the Hereafter  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4050) they might not believe in here after but  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4052) we tell them as well  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4054) at what point in the conversation you  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4056) decide to tell them  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4057) that's going to be a matter of personal  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4059) choice but consequence is c for  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4062) consequence A is for Alternatives  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4063) because he says  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4066) now the thing is people they don't  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4068) realize look he said these are my  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4070) daughters you can marry them  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4073) these are more pure for you and someone  
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4076) would ask how can the prophet offer  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4078) homosexuals I wouldn't I wouldn't offer  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4081) homosexuals to my how could the prophet  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4083) do it so some have done that will of the  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4085) Quran says  
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4086) the girls of the Town it wasn't really  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4088) like any how you say my jersey way  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4090) that's all I think this is a week ago  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4092) Yani I don't believe in that just to be  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4094) honest because then why why would you  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4096) give  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4097) these homosexuals it was such a bad  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4099) thing why would you do it for other  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4099) women mostly women for example yeah it's  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4102) still a problem man  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4105) when he said  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4107) these are my daughters  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4111) he's not saying you can marry them  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4112) straight away  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4113) because we know that if you want to  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4114) marry a chaste person you have to go  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4116) through a whole Rehabilitation process a  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4118) repentance a spiritual repentance and we  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4121) we I mean the converts and for example  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4123) in Africa communities and stuff some of  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4125) them have done worse than Amazon you  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4127) know in our understanding  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4128) some of them have killed people some of  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4130) that but so long as they've gone through  
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4131) a rehabilitation they've repented you  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4133) can see that they now know have the same  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4136) views they've changed so why not give  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4138) them the alternative because let me tell  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4140) you something  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4141) the truth of the matter is that  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4143) sexuality  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4144) is like a wave  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4147) yes and  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4149) a wave is huge  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4152) you can't stand in front of it like that  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4154) and say stop because you'll just get  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4156) washed away with it you can't stop  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4157) someone's sexuality and you can't if  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4159) someone has a sexual desire  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4161) cannot say stop and the person is going  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4164) to say I've made a rational decision I'm  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4166) going to stop  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4167) you can only really redirect and this is  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4170) the idea  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4171) you can redirect to sexuality but you  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4174) can't stop it  
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4175) and sometimes when you try and stop it  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4176) it gets worse like for example let me  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4179) give you a yanny this might be a  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4180) character chore  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4182) but some Fringe members and I'm being of  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4185) the clergy in the Christian World they  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4187) have been found  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4190) to engage in pedophilic practices with  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4193) children  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4194) it's not a representation of the clergy  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4196) it's not representation the priests it's  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4197) not representative however why this  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4199) actian in particular  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4201) is it because the child won't tell is it  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4204) because this is because that  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4206) we don't really know exactly why this  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4209) pathway in particular but what we can  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4210) say is you told them to stop doing  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4212) something now they're doing something  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4213) worse  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4217) sometimes when you try and stop  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4219) something  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4220) you produce a worse result now there's  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4222) many different schools of thought in  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4223) psychology  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4224) there's a cycle analytics school it's  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4227) the behavioral school there's this  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4228) school there's that school whatever  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4231) and all of them have some share of the  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4233) truth about cycle analysts would say if  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4236) you try and tell someone to stop  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4237) thinking of something sexual you're  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4240) actually making them think more about it  
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4243) and they would say that and the moment  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4246) even in the payment Jose mentioned that  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4248) in this book  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4249) so if you just tell them stop  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4252) there's consequences you're going to go  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4253) to hell the likelihood of success is  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4256) very low actually  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4258) you should do that should be a part of  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4259) the package but it's not the only thing  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4260) you can't just do that  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4262) so you have to give them an alternative  
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4264) and the question is is it possible now  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4267) once you free up in the mind of any  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4269) homosexual whether by the way there are  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4272) many Muslims who suffer from these kinds  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4273) of feelings  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4275) once they free up the possibility that  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4277) yes I can change my sexuality  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4281) because the question is can you change  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4282) your sexual preference  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4284) the answer is yes there's a good deal of  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4287) evidence that you can change your sexual  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4289) preference and you know who will tell me  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4291) that the the main people ironically  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4293) ironically ironically he will tell you  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4295) that you can change your sexual  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4296) preference  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4297) are the queer theorists in the lgbtq  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4299) lobby why they say because sexuality  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4301) just like gender is fluid  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4305) it's very interesting you're saying this  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4306) to me huh  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4308) you say that sexuality is fluid so yes  
[1:11:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4311) and so are you gay yes so can you change  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4318) so it's not fluid  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4320) it's either fluid it's not fluid you  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4321) can't have both ways  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4323) Yani the one question you ask the  
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4326) homosexual who is whether the Muslim or  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4328) not is sexuality fluid  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4330) just like you're saying gender's fluid  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4332) yes I'm gender fluid  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4335) I'm saying it's sexuality fluid you say  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4337) yes I say if sexuality is fluid it means  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4340) there's a possibility you can change  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4341) your sexual preference  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4343) now the question is does one want to  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4345) change their sexual preference  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4347) that's all it boils down to there's one  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4349) want to change their sexual preference  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4351) what I'm saying too is if there's a will  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4353) there's a way  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4355) if there's a will then there is a way  
[1:12:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4359) now  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4361) before there was something called  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4363) conversion therapy which actually is  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4365) outlawed and I think the UK and many  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4366) other countries in Europe I don't know  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4368) about the United States of America but  
[1:12:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4370) people used to come into the  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4371) psychologist's office and they used to  
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4373) actually  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4374) uh you know want to change their  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4376) sexuality to becoming heterosexual now  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4378) they're saying it's an offensive which I  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4380) think is nonsense because actually this  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4382) is an affront to Liberal individualism  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4384) like if you believe in Liberal  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4385) individualism yes if you believe in  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4388) Liberal individualism you should allow  
[1:13:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4390) the person to change his whatever he  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4392) wants to change  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4393) yeah I mean if you wanted to become a  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4395) homosexual you've got to say stop to him  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4396) as well  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4399) at what extent are you going to try and  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4401) encroach the rights of the people like  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4403) this anyway  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4405) the alternative thing is a very  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4407) important component and it's it works  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4410) with almost any sexuality  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4413) what I'll say is on this point as well  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4418) the question is I'll go into a little  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4420) bit more detail  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4421) yeah why not  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4424) the question is this is that how does  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4426) sexuality work  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4429) it's a very complicated question I can't  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4430) answer it this time no chance  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4432) but it's important for us Muslims to  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4434) have a proper discussion about this  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4435) because a lot of it right like a lot of  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4438) the stakes are high now in the society  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4439) that we live in the six or two high for  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4440) us not to understand this stuff  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4442) sexuality Works in a very complex way  
[1:14:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4445) where physiology and psychology and  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4447) biology are all connected  
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4450) and the truth of the matter is that  
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4452) there is something called the  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4453) sympathetic nervous system you've got  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4455) the autonomic nervous system right and  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4458) it's just divided into two the  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4459) parasympathetic and the sympathetic  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4461) nervous system the sympathetic nervous  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4463) system it deals with fight or flight  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4465) responses and  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4467) excitement stuff like for example  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4469) sexuality is in that domain  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4473) because we're living in the age of  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4474) boredom we are living in the the age of  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4477) border in fact one philosopher very  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4480) famously said that we oscillate between  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4482) two different ages ages of war and ages  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4485) of border  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4486) because if you're not going to war you  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4488) get bought there's no fight there's no  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4489) survival you get bored you're staying at  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4491) home what am I doing I just let me see  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4493) flick flick flick flick and watch watch  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4495) flick flick flick that's your life  
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4496) you're living in the age of boredom  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4500) so what does someone who's both want to  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4502) do tell me now like they want to not  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4504) necessarily just fight that is one of  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4506) the things  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4507) excite they want excitement  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4510) now imagine up someone has built up a  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4513) tolerance  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4514) built up a tolerance to anything this is  
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4517) the biological element  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4518) at one point I was doing some studies  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4520) and stuff I started taking Ritalin if  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4522) you know what written I haven't got ADHD  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4524) so ADHD thing it gives you a bit makes  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4526) you think it makes you like concentrate  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4528) it's not it doesn't make you high-end  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4530) just in case anybody understands  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4531) thinking it makes you concentrate gives  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4533) you more power  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4534) but it gave me this uh how do you say it  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4537) it made me very bored when I stopped  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4540) taking it I was thinking why am I  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4541) yawning all the time what's wrong with  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4542) me man  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4543) and I realized it's because it increases  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4545) your dopamine levels to such a level  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4546) which is Yanni is surges and then the  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4550) crash is big  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4551) it's the same thing when you use your  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4554) phone and when you use this in  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4555) pornographies and there's films and all  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4556) that it increases the dopamine to such a  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4558) high level that to keep it high  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4561) you need some new excitement  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4565) and some psychologists have said that in  
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4567) order to get that sexual excitement you  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4568) need they refer to it as transgression  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4571) something which you know or at least you  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4573) think morally According To You Is Wrong  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4576) which by the way I did a study uh not  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4578) not through using anything illicit I was  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4581) looking at where homosexuality  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4582) pornography is consumed the most  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4585) and you'll be very surprised a lot of it  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4587) is in African countries where you know  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4589) like Kenny and so on here there's lots  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4591) of countries like this yes you think why  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4593) is that they're they're up they're  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4594) opposite to homosexuality they're  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4596) against it but because  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4599) it's a transgression everyone knows  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4601) what's wrong in that country  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4602) every sometimes when you know something  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4604) is wrong you want to do it more  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4605) yeah  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4606) the point is is that it's a  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4609) transgression now how do you solve this  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4610) issue therefore  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4618) okay  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4630) so the point I was making is this is I  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4632) was saying that  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4633) how do you moderate this point like how  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4637) do you moderate if you if you know that  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4638) what excites you is these transgressions  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4640) and these kinds of things yeah how do  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4641) you moderate the point  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4643) actually there's two ways of moderating  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4644) yeah and it technically and logically  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4646) there's only two ways of doing it  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4649) number one is to increase in the  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4651) behavior  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4652) at number two is to decrease in the  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4654) behavior hey honey there's only two  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4656) things you can do increase or decrease  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4658) there's no third option  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4661) now what do I mean by that like say for  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4663) example if you're addicted to drugs  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4664) you're not getting the high that you  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4666) wanted to  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4667) yes with this level of drugs so you go  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4671) higher  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4671) that's one way you can get the high  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4673) again feel good again another way is to  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4675) stop taking the drugs all together and  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4677) then you'll feel good  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4678) when you do when you take coffee or  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4680) something you drink coffee you'll feel  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4681) good from other things other than the  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4682) drug people that are drug addicted  
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4684) because the truth is why am I comparing  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4686) drug with sexuality because a big part  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4688) of the brain that works with sexuality  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4690) is the same part of the brain which  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4691) works with the drugs many have said this  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4693) The Reptilian core and this kind of  
[1:18:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4695) things in the brain and the yes one  
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4697) second let me just here so do you see  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4698) the point I'm saying there's two ways  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4700) you can either reduce or you can  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4702) increase  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4704) what we can do therefore a good  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4707) therapeutic method for somebody who's  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4708) suffering from homosexuality  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4711) is to wean them off their behaviors  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4715) clearly you offer them alternatives  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4718) and you win them after behaviors like  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4720) any other drug  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4723) someone wants to stop  
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4725) doing any Behavior you win them often  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4726) offer them an alternative  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4729) and yes you remind them of the  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4730) consequences we said I've got a new  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4731) acronym for you to how to deal with  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4733) homosexuals C is for consequences and we  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4736) said that that's Hereafter and Dunya we  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4738) said A is for Alternatives and we  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4739) explain the mechanics behind this  
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4742) and then the third thing is very  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4744) important is purpose because when you  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4746) which is p yeah P for purpose which is  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4749) when you offer them a purpose now  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4751) you've got to give them a reason you've  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4752) got to give anybody  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4754) you're doing anything at all  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4755) and if you give someone a strong enough  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4757) reason they 'll stop like for example if  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4759) I say Yani if you do this if you call  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4762) your boyfriend Daniel sorry this Tomball  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4765) is going to take this out of context but  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4767) if I say let's just say you if you I get  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4770) a gun someone says and say if you call  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4772) your girlfriend I will shoot your head  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4776) you call her yeah let me give you a more  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4778) X example because I want you to remember  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4780) this  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4781) imagine you are in you are just about to  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4784) engage in zinner sorry to say not you  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4785) somebody else  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4786) Yanni or you're just about to watch  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4788) something Hala on the internet just  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4790) about to watch pornography or something  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4791) like that yes you're very excited your  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4793) sympathetic nervous system your your  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4795) heart racing you're ready to do it  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4798) you're gonna watch it now someone comes  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4800) into the door boom puts the gun on your  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4802) head in two seconds you know what's  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4804) gonna happen all of your shower  
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4808) okay  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4811) why because the situation the fear has  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4814) overpowered your Shuffle I'm saying to  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4816) you if there's a will there's a way and  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4818) if you can do it in that context you can  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4820) do it in any context so it's a matter of  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4822) motivation therefore  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4824) because fear produces a motivational  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4825) drive I'm saying that you can produce  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4827) the same motivational drive without the  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4829) extraneous variable  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4831) it's going to be hard there's no one's  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4832) going to say it's going to be easy but  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4834) the fact that it's possible is also that  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4836) someone needs to know  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4837) one second let me just finish this out  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4840) because the Sheikh also wants to get  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4841) involved in it yeah so we said C is for  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4844) what  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4845) consequences it was A4  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4848) Alternatives very important was people  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4851) the purpose and there's another P CAP  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4852) with two P's yeah the other p is  
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4854) purification  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4857) because one of the things which is the  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4859) fifth threat of the human being is that  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4861) he wished to be purified yeah let me  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4863) give you an example  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4864) most of you I don't know about the the  
[1:21:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4866) service of this hotel for you guys but  
[1:21:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4868) for us we've had a problem with the you  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4870) know people haven't cleaned the roots  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4871) put your hands up your rooms have been  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4872) cleaned no if they have been cleaned so  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4874) the problem isn't it we should go and do  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4876) a major complaint but that's inside the  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4877) point now I'm being serious  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4880) but no I'm saying how do you feel about  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4882) that  
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4883) you feel very upset about that aren't  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4884) you you go to somewhere where you see  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4886) dirty on the floor this and that your  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4887) towel is over there your trousers here  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4891) you don't no one bill filter there's  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4894) good evidence to show that no one likes  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4896) to be in a dirty and messy environment  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4897) no one likes that  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4899) so blacks that therefore the person  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4901) likes to be cleaned  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4902) yeah we like to clean ourselves we like  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4904) to brush our teeth brushing our teeth is  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4906) common to everybody it's common to every  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4908) civilization on the face of the Earth it  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4910) I don't know actually maybe I shouldn't  
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4912) say but at least some form of brushing  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4914) the teeth getting rid of bad smells like  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4916) we don't like good to bad smells we're  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4918) trying yeah every rubber section in the  
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4920) world will say I brush my teeth yeah  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4922) there's not every single one yeah you  
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4923) get on point why because they like to be  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4924) purified you see  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4926) homosexual has a shower  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4929) doesn't he the person who has  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4932) homosexual desires also has a shower  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4935) because they want to get the dirt of  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4936) their bodies  
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4937) so when you offer purification to people  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4940) people they take it  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4942) if they believe in that purification  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4945) what we're offering is not a sea  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4947) purification though what we're offering  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4948) is a manner with purification it's a  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4950) spiritual one it's a cleaning you're  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4952) cleaning will be saying because when you  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4954) bring the purification in it we don't  
[1:22:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4955) bring that enough  
[1:22:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4957) you know these things we need to and the  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4960) Quran is Malik with these kind of things  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4962) you see it's it's like a test key yeah  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4967) he's already succeeded the one who has  
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4969) purified himself so we offer them  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4971) purification  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4974) and this is very important so I'm going  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4975) to let the chef do the uh the Hadith  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=4977) okay

[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5402) which is very powerful Hadith actually  
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5405) because it even includes this men's  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5406) includes Muslims non-muslims animals

[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5420) which is first of all my jebus who is  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5423) one of those Hobbies he came through

[1:31:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5481) I don't know I think it might be 10  
[1:31:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5483) minutes  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5490) well basically this hadiths are  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5493) basically like you know there's lots of  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5494) them there's like a bit more sofa like  
[1:31:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5497) sometimes the chef will teach the  
[1:31:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5499) student and you say I'll shake your hand  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5501) too so shaking his head and then he the  
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5503) person shakes the other guy's hand and  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5504) he goes on like that until our times  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5512) anyway we move on  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5514) so just to repeat what was the what was  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5516) the acronym that we just learned  
[1:31:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5518) all right who wants your brother yeah

[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5547) we can see that Allah he affirmed that  
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5549) this is enough that offer them  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5552) you know he said this is he did he did

[1:33:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5624) because I'm just thinking now  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5627) did I did I says  
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5644) I'm sorry let me just mention that  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5647) because this kind of helps with the  
[1:34:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5649) answer and they sought to statuate his  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5652) guests now who was guess who remembers  
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5655) the angels that came now it's beautiful  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5657) because in the previous Surah we talked  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5659) about an angel which is Angel Gabriel  
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5661) and in fact he was described as being  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5663) pure from all defects talking about  
[1:34:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5665) purification I imagine you have three  
[1:34:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5667) angels in the form of men who came to to  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5670) Lord's House and these guys the first  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5673) thing they thought about is I want to  
[1:34:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5674) have intercourse with disguise  
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5677) what kind of what kind of baby is that  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5679) yet  
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5681) walking in the streets and they're very  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5684) well you know imagine how Angels would  
[1:34:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5685) have been presented yet very clean very  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5688) perfect Annie and there must be like the  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5690) whole beautiful stuff you see someone  
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5693) like even now if you see someone  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5695) presenting himself in a very respectable  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5697) way  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5697) the last thing you'll do is say you know  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5700) something like that  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5703) it's not normal  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5706) like they have they have objectified the  
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5709) men look in fact you know we'll talk  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5711) about justification of women it's it's  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5712) true women objectified unfortunately  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5714) into their society  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5716) but especially in in homosexual circles  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5719) men are also objectified don't forget  
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5721) like if you think about it if men are  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5724) prone to of justification  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5726) and then they're attracted to other men  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5727) then objectification continues  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5730) so the first thing to think about is  
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5732) they think about as sexual opportunities  
[1:35:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5734) they don't look at men they look at them  
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5736) as sexual opportunities  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5739) and they are angels  
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5742) and this is actually it's interesting  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5744) for like women who get harassed and  
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5746) stuff that even their angels will have  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5748) sexually harassed like can I think about  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5750) that  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5752) by the the Angels they came to the house  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5754) of Lord they were and how did Lord he  
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5757) was very very troubled by that how did  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5760) he respond to us like he was shocked by  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5761) it even by his standards what they're  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5764) doing like which by the way it shows you  
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5766) that  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5767) we think lgbtq and homosexuality is a  
[1:36:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5770) new phenomena it really isn't this is a  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5771) good evidence that it's not it's always  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5773) been there in history  
[1:36:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5774) oh by the way I want to make another  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5776) Point since we're on the top of Canada  
[1:36:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5778) it's an interesting  
[1:36:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5779) it's an interesting one  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5782) you know how the galley in modern  
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5785) explanations biological explanations  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5788) they use evolutionary psychology  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5790) a lot of the time they say this has  
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5793) happened because of this evolutionary  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5794) reason in life what is the evolution  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5796) reason for this yeah if you think about  
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5798) it  
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5799) this this behavior is not even  
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5801) explicable on an evolutionary level  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5804) it doesn't help with reproduction it  
[1:36:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5805) doesn't help with  
[1:36:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5807) survivability these are the two things  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5809) like why would you need to do this  
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5812) you see the point so it's it's an  
[1:36:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5815) anomalous kind of behavior if you think  
[1:36:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5817) about the the uh to go into these angels  
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5820) of this bathroom sexual opportunities  
[1:37:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5822) they're gone now they're finished they  
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5824) have shahua they're addicted they don't  
[1:37:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5826) see humans anymore  
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5828) because a lot of people wanted to it's  
[1:37:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5830) so ironic isn't it that one of the  
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5832) greatest criticisms of these stories  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5834) both in the Old Testament and in the  
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5835) Quran is that look they dehumanize  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5837) homosexuals not actually the human in  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5840) these stories the homosexual the  
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5842) homosexuals are dehumanized elements  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5844) and then they will dehumanized as a  
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5846) result  
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5847) yes so when you say sexual opportunities  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5850) I mean it almost seems  
[1:37:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5852) uh the second quarter I think is diverse  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5854) is something is that when they come to  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5856) Saint Luke's house they're not asking  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5859) for permission they're literally saying  
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5860) we're stashing these people and yes  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5862) they're willing to like it or not so  
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5863) this is not even looking at is like you  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5865) know we start talking to them there  
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5867) could be an opportunity whether they  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5869) like it or not we're gonna be doing this  
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5870) so like it's actually it's a crime it's  
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5872) real and it's sexual entitlement to the  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5874) highest level and by the way this this  
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5875) crime is is not left the minds of people  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5878) like  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5884) it's not your right  
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5887) their body their choice yeah it's even  
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5889) their Angels yeah what can we do yes  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5893) um so there was a type of  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5896) basically the person said that they and  
[1:38:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5899) they like lift up this article that had  
[1:38:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5901) said that  
[1:38:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5902) these ayads were about rape and  
[1:38:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5905) foreign  
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5930) different places here  
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5933) so this is very weak because then they  
[1:38:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5936) would not be able to answer all of these  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5937) things  
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5941) yeah I know the liberal guy I forget his  
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5944) name is  
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5949) and they early on tomorrow and abiding  
[1:39:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5953) punishment system  
[1:39:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5954) so taste my wrath and warning you must  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5958) taste it because seeing it hearing it is  
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5960) no longer a thing for you now you must  
[1:39:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5962) feel it  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5963) now you must feel it that's the only  
[1:39:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5965) recourse with you we tried our best we  
[1:39:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5968) brought a prophet in fact Lord was  
[1:39:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5971) connected to who which of the prophets  
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5973) yes yes  
[1:39:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5975) does everyone know the connections  
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5987) exactly you know he was connected to him  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5992) yeah  
[1:39:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5995) I have to make sure  
[1:39:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5997) but yeah you see that's another thing  
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=5999) now we're going to move to the next one  
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6002) another to the people of pharaohs came  
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6006) Warners  
[1:40:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6014) the people rejected all our signs but we  
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6017) seized them with such a penalty as comes  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6019) from one exalted in power able to carry  
[1:40:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6021) out his will he's a very wordy  
[1:40:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6022) translation it's good yeah  
[1:40:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6026) they imagine how many ayat they were  
[1:40:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6028) given it's sort of their mentions it's  
[1:40:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6032) nine this is it's actually nine major  
[1:40:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6035) ones that they were given the splaying  
[1:40:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6037) of the sea the hand coming out yeah  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6039) imagine seeing all of that all of that  
[1:40:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6041) you know it's not the magician stuff  
[1:40:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6042) because the magician even The Magicians  
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6044) came without such that the top  
[1:40:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6046) suggestions everything and then you're  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6048) still rejecting everything why because  
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6050) you're arrogant that is the top reason  
[1:40:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6053) why you're doing it  
[1:41:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6062) your unbelief is better than they are or  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6064) have you immunity in the sacred books  
[1:41:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6067) so basically Allah now is speaking to  
[1:41:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6070) the people of quraish is the people of  
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6072) quraisha you guys better than them Yani  
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6074) do you think you did better than them  
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6075) meaning their civilization well it was  
[1:41:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6077) better than yours actually  
[1:41:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6079) or it could mean that you're the same in  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6082) your careful your Catholic that's it  
[1:41:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6085) that's what it means yeah  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6089) are you guys yeah are you guys do you  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6091) think you're really better than these  
[1:41:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6093) guys you're the same  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6094) you rejected a prophet you rejected a  
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6097) prophet  
[1:41:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6098) you're walking around strutting around  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6100) thinking that you're stable in finances  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6102) and civilization they did the same they  
[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6104) are the major one as well  
[1:41:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6106) Pharaoh was arrogant you guys are  
[1:41:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6108) arrogant  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6109) and and therefore  
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6112) don't think you're any different  
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6116) what did I say  
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6118) we can act together to defend ourselves  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6125) is referring to the Battle of beta and  
[1:42:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6128) this is actually a prophecy  
[1:42:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6131) could mention this okay when he was in  
[1:42:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6134) the tents before the Battle of brother  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6136) he would say say  
[1:42:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6139) he would continuously repeat it  
[1:42:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6143) he's basically saying that in the Battle  
[1:42:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6145) of better you guys are going to run away  
[1:42:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6147) the Quran is saying that you guys are  
[1:42:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6148) going to lose this battle  
[1:42:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6150) bear in mind this this didn't come about  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6152) enough  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6154) this is a prediction of the Quran  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6156) it's a very dangerous production he's  
[1:42:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6158) the brother's wearing a Moroccan t-shirt  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6160) yeah so for example if I right before  
[1:42:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6162) the Morocco match with uh with the  
[1:42:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6166) Portugal yes I say Morocco is going to  
[1:42:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6169) be Portugal it's a big climate they had  
[1:42:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6171) the Cristiano Ronaldo like it was almost  
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6172) finished his career those kind of things  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6175) it's a big claim if they win that's a  
[1:42:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6176) that's a big our shock when they scored  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6178) that goal  
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6180) I want to tell you for it more of that I  
[1:43:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6183) was absolutely ecstatic I couldn't  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6185) believe it  
[1:43:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6187) because we don't have it's the first  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6189) time an Arab team you know or an African  
[1:43:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6191) team has reached the semi-finals of the  
[1:43:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6193) World Cup it's a big deal  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6195) there's 300 people fighting a thousand  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6198) it's it's the betting favorites the  
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6203) pagans on paper it's a three to one  
[1:43:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6205) Underdog or something I don't know  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6208) the Quran  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6210) understood that as we are going to be  
[1:43:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6214) Victorious and better  
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6217) and he was saying it he was by the way  
[1:43:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6221) this shows you that the faith the man  
[1:43:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6223) has whenever there's a prediction of the  
[1:43:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6225) Quran he comes out and he's so happy  
[1:43:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6227) about it he knows what he means like for  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6230) example you know with the Hollywood  
[1:43:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6231) rooms  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6239) where it says that the Romans have  
[1:44:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6240) beaten the Persians and after three to  
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6242) nine years they will come and they'll  
[1:44:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6243) beat them again  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6244) he went because at that time gambling  
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6246) was not Haram because gambling became  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6248) later on he took all of his candles and  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6251) money and he said let me he went to find  
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6253) somebody to put because remember what we  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6255) said last time  
[1:44:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6256) we said that if the fortune tellers were  
[1:44:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6259) true fortune tellers where would they be  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6260) in the casino  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6264) he was a casino  
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6266) [Music]  
[1:44:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6269) he went and he said this is my money he  
[1:44:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6272) put all cash into it  
[1:44:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6274) he believed it this shows you that this  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6276) is however they believed the religion of  
[1:44:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6277) Islam but it also shows you that the  
[1:44:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6280) dangerous level of the predictions of  
[1:44:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6281) the Quran they're all dangerous the  
[1:44:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6283) predictions of the Quran are so  
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6284) dangerous  
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6286) because if you get this wrong your whole  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6288) prophethood or the claimant to  
[1:44:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6290) prophethood is put into question  
[1:44:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6293) imagine I'm saying I'm gonna beat you  
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6294) guys in a how could you know  
[1:44:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6298) how do you know they're gonna win  
[1:45:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6301) how do you know you are the betting  
[1:45:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6302) underdogs  
[1:45:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6304) it is too dangerous to say you're going  
[1:45:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6305) to work and to connect that with  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6306) Revelation a true prophet  
[1:45:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6310) does this a false prophet never does  
[1:45:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6312) this and if a false prophet does this he  
[1:45:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6313) always gets caught  
[1:45:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6315) like this  
[1:45:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6319) is a man who claimed to be a prophet  
[1:45:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6322) after the prophet and then you have a  
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6325) group called The ahmadis and he said  
[1:45:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6328) I am going to marry a woman her name is  
[1:45:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6331) Muhammad I begum  
[1:45:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6332) that's what he said imagine this he goes  
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6334) and listen he got excited because he's  
[1:45:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6336) in love now yeah  
[1:45:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6339) he goes if I don't marry her I'm not a  
[1:45:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6341) true prophet  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6342) he went that far he went that far you  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6345) know what happened to him he didn't  
[1:45:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6346) marry him  
[1:45:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6350) that's it you're finished it's done  
[1:45:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6353) it's finished  
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6356) but on the flip side whenever the Quran  
[1:45:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6358) makes a prediction about a future event  
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6360) it happens exactly as it's mentioned and  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6364) the sahaba are so expressly abubakar  
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6367) because he is a Sadiq he is so ecstatic  
[1:46:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6369) and excited about the situation he goes  
[1:46:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6371) and puts all his mind on the situation  
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6372) he's willing to put his life on the line  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6374) actually  
[1:46:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6377) and he had to fight his son in the  
[1:46:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6379) battlefield  
[1:46:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6380) this is the level of belief he had his  
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6382) son was in the same Battlefield as that  
[1:46:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6383) and then his son became Muslim  
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6385) thereafter  
[1:46:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6386) and then you know his son said to him I  
[1:46:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6390) have to look at your sentence on the  
[1:46:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6391) fonticity of it he goes you know that  
[1:46:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6393) we're in the we're in the battlefield I  
[1:46:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6395) was trying to avoid you you know you  
[1:46:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6397) know what you say he said I was trying  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6398) to look for you  
[1:46:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6400) I was trying to find you  
[1:46:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6405) this is a next level of Faith  
[1:46:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6412) you don't find somebody who really  
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6414) believes in Allah  
[1:46:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6415) love the ones who go against Allah is  
[1:46:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6418) Messenger he had the true belief he  
[1:47:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6421) doesn't care is that he loved Allah  
[1:47:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6423) messenger more than his children more  
[1:47:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6425) than his wives more than everybody this  
[1:47:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6427) is the highest level after the prophets  
[1:47:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6429) so he was saying this Ayah and he was  
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6433) excited he was like after he was the  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6436) most excited person after because he  
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6438) knew what's going to happen  
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6440) there's a big victory and it's one of  
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6441) the biggest victories of Islam oh it was  
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6443) a small Skirmish only a few people died  
[1:47:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6445) comparative to the wars that happened  
[1:47:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6447) today but it was so symbolic  
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6450) that it changed the course of history as  
[1:47:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6451) we know it  
[1:47:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6457) is  
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6461) that the time the hour is damn right  
[1:47:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6463) Allahu Akbar because whenever Allah  
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6466) makes a prediction or not every single  
[1:47:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6467) time but commonly he connects it to  
[1:47:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6471) NASA  
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6478) after he says  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6481) connected to the afterlife now he's  
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6484) saying just like I predicted this thing  
[1:48:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6485) which is so dangerous to predict which  
[1:48:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6487) no other book would have predicted C.S  
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6490) Lewis who wrote a very famous Christian  
[1:48:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6492) guy  
[1:48:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6493) he was talking about something in the  
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6495) Bible called the Olivet discourse  
[1:48:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6498) it's a it's a passage in The Book of  
[1:48:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6500) Mark which said that the whole world  
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6502) will end in one generation  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6504) and you know what he called it he said  
[1:48:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6506) this he said it's the most embarrassing  
[1:48:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6508) verse in the Bible  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6511) C.S Lewis if you almost all Christians  
[1:48:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6514) know who he is he is the biggest figure  
[1:48:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6518) Bar None no doubt about it  
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6521) when I went to the University of Oxford  
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6523) his pictures were everywhere  
[1:48:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6525) C.S Lewis  
[1:48:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6532) by the way C.S Lewis I believe you know  
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6536) this formulation is either deluded or  
[1:48:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6537) deceptive or a liar or speaking the  
[1:49:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6540) truth a lot of it he I think he took  
[1:49:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6543) this from the Quran because he put that  
[1:49:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6544) in his book he had like a an apologetic  
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6547) material talking about why he believes  
[1:49:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6548) Christianity is true he also mentions by  
[1:49:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6551) the way he also mentions the uh the  
[1:49:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6553) resurrection is the biggest evidence and  
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6554) the Miracles the biggest evidence C.S  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6556) Lewis also mentions those things  
[1:49:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6558) point I'm making is that he is one of  
[1:49:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6561) the biggest figures and he's he is  
[1:49:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6562) saying we have a verse in the Bible  
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6565) which is trying to tell us the future  
[1:49:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6566) and is the most embarrassing verse in  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6569) the Bible why is it why is it  
[1:49:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6570) embarrassing C.S Lewis it's embarrassing  
[1:49:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6573) because you got it wrong the Bible got  
[1:49:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6575) it wrong  
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6577) and this is one of the biggest Scholars  
[1:49:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6578) that he's universally accepted Catholics  
[1:49:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6580) accept him and Protestants Etc you've  
[1:49:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6583) you rarely find the unifying figure like  
[1:49:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6584) this guy and he is admitting candidly  
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6587) and openly this verse the Olivet  
[1:49:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6589) discourse you can check out online  
[1:49:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6592) Wikipedia page is no one can read on it  
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6595) is the most embarrassing verse in the  
[1:49:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6597) Bible you don't have like that in the  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6598) Quran that's why our book we talk about  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6600) memorization we were talking about but  
[1:50:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6603) this is why our book is the best it's  
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6605) the truth  
[1:50:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6606) it's too much well when you compare it  
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6609) it's done the deal is done if someone is  
[1:50:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6611) sincere the evidence is and as we said  
[1:50:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6613) the evidences in the Quran are better  
[1:50:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6615) than the evidences that any of the  
[1:50:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6617) prophets have been given before  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6619) because those evidences were what  
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6621) time-bound they favored those who saw  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6623) them and so on whereas the Quran can be  
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6626) examined today we have a retrospective  
[1:50:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6628) hindsight perspective where we can look  
[1:50:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6631) back and say well let's look at the  
[1:50:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6632) predictions of the Quran we see all of  
[1:50:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6635) them are actually true we saw all of  
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6637) them are not only true but they're  
[1:50:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6638) dangerous as well in the first place to  
[1:50:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6640) make  
[1:50:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6647) and then  
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6650) that certainly those who are in sin or  
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6654) the criminals are strained and strength  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6658) in mind and mat  
[1:51:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6660) remember they were accusing the prophet  
[1:51:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6663) of this Allah is now saying they're  
[1:51:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6665) projecting it's them that have this  
[1:51:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6667) problem  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6668) it's not the problem it's you guys that  
[1:51:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6670) you're the Mad ones  
[1:51:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6679) they will be pulled on their faces in  
[1:51:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6681) the Hellfire taste  
[1:51:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6683) taste the punishment of the Hellfire  
[1:51:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6687) they will be just like the people of  
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6688) Noah and the people of Lord and the  
[1:51:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6690) people of ayat and the people of samud  
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6692) and the people around all of them you're  
[1:51:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6694) going to be like inshallah but yeah I  
[1:51:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6697) mean those guys would be like the  
[1:51:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6699) message are going to be just like them  
[1:51:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6700) they're going to be learning and in pain  
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6702) I didn't  
[1:51:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6703) yes  
[1:51:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6706) this is not a joking laughing matter why  
[1:51:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6708) this is a serious and they will they  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6709) will fade they will taste it  
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6713) in their collection  
[1:51:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6715) means proportion and measure although it  
[1:51:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6718) has been translated as predestination by  
[1:52:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6720) Martin Khan  
[1:52:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6725) and our Command is not just but one  
[1:52:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6729) command like a twinkling of the eye  
[1:52:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6736) and we have destroyed the gangs this is  
[1:52:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6739) what kind of translation limitation The  
[1:52:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6742) Gangs the gangs  
[1:52:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6743) and indeed we have destroyed your likes  
[1:52:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6745) in the past and will there be any uh  
[1:52:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6747) remember will any of you remember just  
[1:52:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6750) look at the books that are written on  
[1:52:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6751) civilization the rise and fall of great  
[1:52:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6754) Empires  
[1:52:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6755) where are the Romans where are the  
[1:52:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6757) Greeks where are the Egyptians  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6759) where are these great civilizations  
[1:52:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6761) where have they gone now  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6764) the Roman Empire was in Italy the other  
[1:52:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6766) day and I was looking at the Coliseum  
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6768) and looking at the Museum upstairs and  
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6770) this kind of things look at these people  
[1:52:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6771) now well they know well they know  
[1:52:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6775) and the Julius Caesar and this one  
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6778) where are you now  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6782) Napoleon came uh what was his name no  
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6784) sir Mussolini he changed the  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6785) architecture outside of the Colosseum he  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6787) messed it everything up  
[1:53:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6789) he made himself the center of attention  
[1:53:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6793) where is Mussolini where's Hitler  
[1:53:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6796) where are most of the presidents of the  
[1:53:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6798) United States of America  
[1:53:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6802) they all finished actually they're all  
[1:53:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6803) done  
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6805) and that is the reality  
[1:53:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6810) and each and every thing they have done  
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6814) is noted in the rest of the Deeds  
[1:53:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6818) everything big and small is written  
[1:53:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6825) that  
[1:53:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6827) certainly now the pious ones will be  
[1:53:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6831) in gardens and rivers  
[1:53:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6834) in a sea of truth in Paradise near the  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6838) omnipotent King the most high  
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6842) and then in the next Surah which will  
[1:54:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6844) not be doing together but  
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6845) there's more discussion in the beginning  
[1:54:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6847) of our heaven  
[1:54:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6849) and less about hell so it kind of  
[1:54:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6851) inverts the situation and this is part  
[1:54:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6853) of the symmetry of the Quran in one soul  
[1:54:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6855) I talked more about Helen Evans and the  
[1:54:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6857) other one  
[1:54:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6857) more heavens and hell and it kind of all  
[1:54:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6860) weighs itself  
[1:54:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6861) I know it's been two hours actually it's  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6864) been as we said it would be any  
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6866) questions any questions yes can you just  
[1:54:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6868) answer this question about the  
[1:54:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6870) compilation of the Quran yes  
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6873) so basically there's two views among the  
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6875) scholars yeah all the other son of the  
[1:54:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6877) Quran are they put in place like that  
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6879) from The Scholar from the sahaba or they  
[1:54:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6882) put like that from Allah in the  
[1:54:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6883) messenger and it was something  
[1:54:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6886) some say it's so creepy some say actions  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6891) the truth of the matter is either way it  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6893) doesn't really matter because let me  
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6895) just give you an example of what this  
[1:54:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6896) means let's say for example you have you  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6899) know the jigsaw puzzle a jigsaw puzzle  
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6901) is made up of certain way whatever  
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6902) whether you put it whether it's already  
[1:55:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6905) pre-made I in the case of tokif or  
[1:55:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6908) whether it doesn't have I have to figure  
[1:55:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6910) out where to put Watts  
[1:55:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6912) it doesn't really matter because the  
[1:55:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6913) jigsaw Remains the Same either way and  
[1:55:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6915) so the Quran is as it is now  
[1:55:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6919) is as it is now the fact that it's  
[1:55:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6921) capable of being structured in this way  
[1:55:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6923) is evidence that it's structurally  
[1:55:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6926) coherent now the second thing I'll say  
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6927) is I actually do believe  
[1:55:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6929) I believe  
[1:55:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6931) that the uh  
[1:55:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6933) he told he was told by the angel Gabriel  
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6935) what to put what in what order now for  
[1:55:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6938) sure we know that's the case with the  
[1:55:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6939) sword  
[1:55:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6940) with the ayat which that is actually  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6945) for example you find this  
[1:55:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6947) famous hadiths that you know if you read  
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6949) the first 10 areas of the last 10 years  
[1:55:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6952) how do you know what's the first 10 or  
[1:55:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6954) the last 10 unless the prophet salaam  
[1:55:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6956) himself he told us what was going to go  
[1:55:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6958) where  
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6962) if you read the uh the the the for  
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6965) example  
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6969) combined together in Hadith  
[1:56:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6971) if you read this Hadith and that if you  
[1:56:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6973) read this Surah together  
[1:56:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6975) so it would seem like it was topify and  
[1:56:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6978) don't forget the prophet salaam would be  
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6979) given the Quran as a whole in Ramadan  
[1:56:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6982) and he would recite it in Allah what all  
[1:56:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6985) did he put him if there is too much  
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6988) evidence to show us that he put it in  
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6990) the order that was where we're reciting  
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6991) now  
[1:56:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6993) so those who say it's not oh it's not  
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6995) covered to believe that this Hub has put  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6997) in that order but I think the  
[1:56:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=6998) overwhelming way of evidence is on the  
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7000) other side  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7002) and even if it wasn't the case it still  
[1:56:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7004) was like that either way in the local  
[1:56:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7006) muscles  
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7007) and it's like a jigsaw puzzle and it's  
[1:56:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7009) like what I just mentioned yeah  
[1:56:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7011) anything else  
[1:56:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7013) yes assistant  
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7019) why  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7029) [Music]  
[1:57:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7035) I mean obviously God doesn't need us to  
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7038) worship Him the life he made us and  
[1:57:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7042) other creatures and like wants us  
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7044) basically to worship him because even  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7047) atheists agree that an all powerful and  
[1:57:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7050) a self-sufficient God doesn't need us to  
[1:57:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7053) worship him so alive  
[1:57:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7055) like what's the reason that they're the  
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7057) government yeah so there's it seems like  
[1:57:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7060) there's two two in one in there so the  
[1:57:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7062) question of why is there something  
[1:57:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7064) rather than nothing is is important for  
[1:57:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7067) an atheist to think about because the  
[1:57:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7069) existence of something cries out for an  
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7071) explanation  
[1:57:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7073) if you have anything in existence the  
[1:57:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7075) question is  
[1:57:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7077) from once did it come how did it get  
[1:57:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7079) there what is generating it what is this  
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7081) cause  
[1:58:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7083) the fact that you have something rather  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7084) than nothing  
[1:58:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7085) you're going to have to ask these  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7086) questions where they come from how did  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7088) it get there and these questions  
[1:58:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7090) themselves are catalysts to start  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7091) thinking about the first cause the  
[1:58:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7092) ultimate cause or the idea of God  
[1:58:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7095) so that's the first thing that's why  
[1:58:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7096) it's a very important question to ask  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7098) on the second point that you made about  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7100) why does God need us to kind of worship  
[1:58:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7102) him so obviously we don't believe that  
[1:58:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7104) he does Allah says  
[1:58:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7107) foreign  
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7117) except that they may worship me I don't  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7119) need them to uh I don't need any  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7122) provision from them nor do I need them  
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7124) to feed me yet  
[1:58:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7126) meaning I'm not gaining from this  
[1:58:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7128) Allah is not gaining from us worshiping  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7131) him  
[1:58:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7132) and that Allah says  
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7133) he is in fact the one who gives  
[1:58:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7137) a very powerful agent  
[1:59:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7140) now the question is why would Allah  
[1:59:03](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7143) create us  
[1:59:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7144) to understand why Allah will do anything  
[1:59:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7148) we have to look at the attributes of God  
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7150) so if you look at the attributes of God  
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7152) what are the attributes of God of them  
[1:59:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7154) is that he is  
[1:59:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7157) he's the best of creators he is the  
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7160) perpetually creating and he is  
[1:59:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7162) the Creator in general these are some of  
[1:59:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7164) his attributes he is alive he is the  
[1:59:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7167) all-knowing he is a Hakeem he is the  
[1:59:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7169) wise  
[1:59:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7170) so what the question is  
[1:59:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7173) does it or does it not befit  
[1:59:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7176) an agent with these characteristics  
[1:59:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7179) to do that which these characteristics  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7182) entails like for example if I say I'm a  
[1:59:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7185) painter but this I don't what's the  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7187) evidence of your painting I have no  
[1:59:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7188) evidence  
[1:59:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7189) I've not painted a single painting the  
[1:59:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7192) point is is that it makes sense for the  
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7194) Creator and who is the best of creators  
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7197) to create  
[1:59:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7199) to create what the best of creation you  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7201) see the idea of a human species which  
[2:00:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7204) has free will  
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7206) which can decide what's right and wrong  
[2:00:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7209) which which is living in a  
[2:00:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7211) environment where I have to cooperate  
[2:00:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7212) where it has to make decisions where  
[2:00:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7215) the best possible idea of a creation  
[2:00:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7218) so so  
[2:00:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7219) amazing is that we don't even know how  
[2:00:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7222) this stuff works the mechanisms of how  
[2:00:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7224) does determinism work with free will how  
[2:00:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7226) does Allah determine it boggles the mind  
[2:00:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7228) that's how powerful  
[2:00:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7231) Allah's creation is so in other words  
[2:00:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7233) the reason why Allah creates this  
[2:00:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7234) because it's a manifestation of his  
[2:00:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7235) attributes it's a manifestation of his  
[2:00:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7238) attributes to create  
[2:00:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7239) because he's the Creator it only makes  
[2:00:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7242) sense for him to create and not only for  
[2:00:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7243) him to create but to create something  
[2:00:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7245) which is the best of creation because  
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7246) he's the best creator  
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7247) so the point I'm making is that  
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7250) you know it's  
[2:00:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7252) not just as creative capacity but other  
[2:00:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7254) attributes it it's a manifestation  
[2:00:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7257) anything that is a creation anything  
[2:00:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7259) that Allah has put into existence  
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7261) its ultimate explanation is that it  
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7265) manifests one of God's attributes in  
[2:01:07](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7267) some way shape or form easily  
[2:01:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7271) what's that makes sense  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7273) okay if not just think about it and  
[2:01:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7276) again yeah would that be like the same  
[2:01:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7278) explanation for why we all don't go to  
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7280) heaven  
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7281) like because some people are like oh  
[2:01:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7283) God is so um merciful and goddess of  
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7286) this and that like the positive  
[2:01:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7288) attributes why is it just sent you all  
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7290) that you know without having to give the  
[2:01:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7293) same explanation because like like the  
[2:01:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7295) thing is total of evil right yeah  
[2:01:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7298) the problem of evil was first put  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7300) forward by someone called epicurus and  
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7302) he said look if God is all powerful and  
[2:01:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7304) he's all good it doesn't make sense for  
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7306) there to be evil in the world because if  
[2:01:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7307) there's evil in the world that means he  
[2:01:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7309) could he could have removed it for his  
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7310) power yeah  
[2:01:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7311) oh he's not actually all good but we  
[2:01:53](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7313) don't believe in a god with two or three  
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7315) attributes yeah we also believe Allah  
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7318) he is the old wise he is and he's got  
[2:02:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7322) other attributes now the point is is the  
[2:02:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7324) Hakeem aspect of God's attributes is  
[2:02:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7326) what is  
[2:02:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7330) is putting the place something in its  
[2:02:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7332) rightful place in our position to volume  
[2:02:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7335) which is yeah it opens of hecam actually  
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7337) the volume of linguistically the  
[2:02:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7339) opposite of Hackman is  
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7343) putting something in this wrongful place  
[2:02:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7345) what I'm saying therefore is it doesn't  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7348) it doesn't negate God's wisdom for him  
[2:02:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7351) he says this to me like I find that  
[2:02:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7354) almost laughable  
[2:02:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7355) in fact some philosophers William Rowe  
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7359) for example atheist he's an atheist he  
[2:02:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7361) said that I don't believe him  
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7363) he said this problem of evil argument is  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7365) morally he said this intellectually  
[2:02:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7367) bankrupt  
[2:02:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7369) even atheists admit that this is a  
[2:02:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7370) nonsense argument because there's no  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7372) Corridor there's no uh it's a  
[2:02:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7375) non-sequito  
[2:02:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7377) it's a non-sequence it doesn't follow  
[2:02:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7379) that just because God is good that there  
[2:03:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7381) should be no pain or suffering  
[2:03:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7384) and I would say to an atheist what is  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7386) what is evil anyway  
[2:03:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7388) are you not the one who says God doesn't  
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7389) exist because you can't find some  
[2:03:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7391) scientific evidence for him so what is  
[2:03:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7393) this even evil that you've got that you  
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7395) can put under a microscope that I can  
[2:03:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7396) see it with you on the laboratory  
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7398) because he won't be able to find such a  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7399) thing  
[2:03:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7400) so in other words evil doesn't exist  
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7402) there's no evidence that evil exists at  
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7404) all  
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7405) what is evil evil is what you don't like  
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7408) evil is the suffering that you have  
[2:03:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7409) what's the difference between pain and  
[2:03:31](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7411) suffering pain  
[2:03:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7412) is  
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7414) the sensory information that you get and  
[2:03:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7416) then but suffering is what you make of  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7418) that sensory information  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7420) if I do 10 push-ups right now  
[2:03:43](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7423) maybe not 10 maybe 20 or 30 let's say 40  
[2:03:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7426) for the sake of argument  
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7429) no but let's just say  
[2:03:51](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7431) no I'll I'll I'll consider it painful  
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7436) let's just say I'll consider it painful  
[2:03:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7437) but I would I could what I call it  
[2:03:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7439) suffering  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7440) like for example when I went up to this  
[2:04:02](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7442) job today I consider that pain and  
[2:04:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7444) suffering you know because I thought  
[2:04:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7446) this is no but really is it suffering  
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7448) though what's suffering suffering is  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7450) what your mind makes of the pain  
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7453) so the point is is that look the the  
[2:04:15](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7455) evil and suffering in the world  
[2:04:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7456) suffering is a test yeah if you consider  
[2:04:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7459) it as a test if you go to the gym you  
[2:04:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7460) consider it as I'm improving myself  
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7462) self-improvement you don't say I'm  
[2:04:23](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7463) suffering I'm suffering ah please don't  
[2:04:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7465) awesome let's go doing this to me  
[2:04:28](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7468) no one does it  
[2:04:30](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7470) but no it's the same concept though  
[2:04:33](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7473) you see it's the same concept Allah is  
[2:04:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7475) putting you through a an adverse  
[2:04:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7477) condition so you can develop yourself  
[2:04:41](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7481) so that's uh there's no argument there  
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7484) and I think they admit it they admit  
[2:04:45](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7485) that the problem of evil there's no  
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7486) actual argument there  
[2:04:48](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7488) any any other questions especially from  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7490) this is to miss out so yes  
[2:04:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7494) so this cap  
[2:04:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7495) methodology doesn't actually work for  
[2:04:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7497) any  
[2:04:59](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7499) yeah yeah any kind of  
[2:05:12](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7512) then yeah the final alternative the  
[2:05:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7514) alternative is marriage you know  
[2:05:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7517) so that's what the limitations is  
[2:05:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7519) because sometimes you can't find the  
[2:05:21](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7521) alternative you  
[2:05:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7522) but you have to try and wait and the  
[2:05:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7524) alternative for by the way the  
[2:05:25](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7525) alternative for uh sorry to say about  
[2:05:27](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7527) excessive masturbation if you're not  
[2:05:29](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7529) married and pornography is not marriage  
[2:05:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7532) it's actually uh is actually it's  
[2:05:34](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7534) actually wet dreams  
[2:05:36](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7536) because the body has a way of flushing  
[2:05:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7537) all that stuff out  
[2:05:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7540) the fasting is not really an alternative  
[2:05:42](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7542) it's more it helps the idea obviously  
[2:05:44](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7544) the process on the device  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7546) myself  
[2:05:47](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7547) and so on but what I'm saying is that  
[2:05:50](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7550) yeah your body will find a way to get  
[2:05:52](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7552) rid of this stuff  
[2:05:54](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7554) but eventually you have to get Pagani  
[2:05:57](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7557) we have to but you should get married  
[2:06:01](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7561) and by the way yummy let's be real some  
[2:06:04](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7564) people get married and they still have  
[2:06:06](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7566) these addictions  
[2:06:08](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7568) so you kind of have to work on yourself  
[2:06:09](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7569) because some people I think to this  
[2:06:10](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7570) because I think I'm going to get married  
[2:06:11](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7571) to be all right they get married and  
[2:06:13](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7573) they continue the stuff why because  
[2:06:14](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7574) you've already programmed yourself to  
[2:06:16](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7576) this thing  
[2:06:17](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7577) so you you kind of have to purify  
[2:06:19](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7579) yourself you have to work on yourself  
[2:06:20](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7580) you have to monitor yourself you have to  
[2:06:22](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7582) hold yourself to account you have to  
[2:06:24](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7584) work on it  
[2:06:26](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7586) yeah any other questions yes  
[2:06:32](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7592) okay well we had a very long discussion  
[2:06:35](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7595) today oh like before  
[2:06:37](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7597) yeah that's fine but we can have more  
[2:06:40](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7600) it's fine anything else

[2:06:55](https://youtu.be/no9nXw8hfds?t=7615) probably be awake as well
