### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=0) - [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=1200)

 discusses the differences between Christianity and Islam with regards to their ideas about love. Dr. Craig argues that, in Christianity, God loves everyone unconditionally and this is contrary to the idea of love in Islam, where God loves some people and not others. However, Dr. Uthman argues that, when looking at verses in the Qur'an that talk about God loving certain people, it is important to understand that these verses are not unconditional in the same way that love is in Christianity. Ultimately, the video makes the case that Islam does not have a "sense of love" towards other people, similar to how Christianity teaches that we are to love our enemies.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=0)**  Dr. Uthman discusses the differences between Christianity and Islam with regards to their ideas about love. Dr. Craig argues that, in Christianity, God loves everyone unconditionally and this is contrary to the idea of love in Islam, where God loves some people and not others. Dr. Uthman argues that, when looking at verses in the Qur'an that talk about God loving certain people, it is important to understand that these verses are not unconditional in the same way that love is in Christianity.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=300)** argues that the love of God in Islam is like this and in Christianity it is an all-encompassing, impartial, and unconditional love. He goes on to say that this is an incorrect premise and incorrect analysis of the Islamic position.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=600)**  Dr. Craig discusses the Bible's teachings on love, and how these teachings are similar to those found in the Qur'an. He also makes the case that Islam does not have a "sense of love" towards other people, similar to how Christianity teaches that we are to love our enemies.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=900)* Discusses Craig's third argument, which is that the quran does not have concepts like perfect love and forgiveness. Craig's argument fails because it is selective quoting, fails to analyze the bible, and is based on a false premise. Islam stresses that the primary thing about faith is having the correct belief about God. If your belief is incorrect, your good deeds are in vain.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFkGbBAgy1s&t=1200)* Discusses the difference between Islam and Christianity, and points out that while Christianity teaches that salvation comes solely from God's grace, Islam teaches that salvation comes from Allah's mercy as well. Additionally, the video points out that while Christianity teaches that we are saved through our good deeds, Islam teaches that all of our good deeds are a result of Allah's grace.

[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=6) assalamualaikum welcome to sapient  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=8) thoughts this is dr uthman native and  
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=9) we're going through my book divine  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=10) perfection christianity and islam on sin  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=13) and salvation a very important topic a  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=15) very crucial understanding christianity  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=18) in its light in this right light and  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=20) islam in this right light as well of  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=22) course the book is also answering back  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=24) against detractors made by destructions  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=26) made by christian mission ethiopia and  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=28) apologists like william lane craig and  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=30) others before and after him as well  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=33) we've been through  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=34) two main arguments made by dr william  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=37) lane craig already about the concept of  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=39) the trinity in the quranic framework  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=41) about humans salvation in the quranic  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=44) model as well  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=46) in contrast to the christian  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=48) idea about atonement represents through  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=50) atonement theories and other things as  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=52) well now the the third argument made by  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=55) dr craig in light of islamic theism is a  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=58) bit similar to the second one but this  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=60) time it's about the idea of love  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=62) so he argues therefore that god can't be  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=65) worthy of worship in islam because he's  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=67) not maximally loving in that he doesn't  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=70) love  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=70) everybody and the christians in fact not  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=73) all christians but he and perhaps people  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=75) like him  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=76) focus on the idea that god loves  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=79) everyone  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=80) god loves everybody  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=82) and therefore if god loves everybody  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=85) then that's the god that we should be  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=86) worshipping as opposed to islam where  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=89) god loves some people and not other  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=91) people and craig therefore in his in his  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=94) works and literature in his debates he  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=96) isolates particular verses in the quran  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=98) where it says that god loves the  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=100) the doers of god those of good god loves  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=103) the repentant god loves the you know the  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=106) ones who make peace god loves so god  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=108) loves particular people uh but god does  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=111) not love other people god doesn't love  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=112) the boastful god doesn't love the  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=114) arrogant god doesn't love the the  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=116) unbelievers for example god doesn't love  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=118) the mischief makers for example or the  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=120) unjust for example so we have those that  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=122) god loves and go that god and those that  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=124) god does not love  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=126) in the quran for example whereas he says  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=128) in in christianity god loves everybody  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=132) and the key verse that christians love  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=134) to cite like him and others is  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=136) for god so loved the world loved the  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=138) world that he gave his only be or he  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=140) sent his only begotten son that he  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=142) whosoever believes in him shall have  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=144) everlasting life and shall not perish so  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=147) therefore since god so loved the world  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=149) meaning the whole world  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=151) that means god loves everybody including  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=154) sinners this is the key thing for us to  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=156) remember about what christians say  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=158) god loves sinners and therefore  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=161) and in contrast the quran in islam the  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=163) god of islam or the quran does not love  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=166) sinners that's the key thing but the  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=168) first thing of course is for us to  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=169) understand this very very clearly number  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=171) one  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=172) christians of course they make this  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=174) argument about god loving everybody but  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=176) there is no agreement in fact amongst  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=178) christians or theologians that god in  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=181) fact loves everybody does god love  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=184) the murderer does god love  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=187) hitler does god love genocidal maniacs  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=190) does god love everybody and does god  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=193) love them exactly the same way now i say  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=195) that because dr craig for example says  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=198) the love of god is three things it's  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=200) impartial it's universal and it's  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=203) unconditional remember those three words  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=205) it's impartial  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=207) unconditional and it's universal whereas  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=210) the love of the god in islam it's  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=213) partial not universal not unconditional  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=215) either therefore the god of uh  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=217) christianity he argues wins the day now  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=220) let's think about this very carefully  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=221) what does it mean to say that the love  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=222) of god is impartial in christianity that  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=225) means it's the same that means god loves  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=228) everybody the same what does that mean  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=231) that means god loves  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=233) hitler like he loves moses that god  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=236) loves the mass murderer like he loves  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=239) the peacemaker that means god love is  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=241) impartial he loves everybody the same  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=244) which means in essence god loves nobody  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=247) because there's no gradients of love for  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=249) us to consider what does love actually  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=251) then mean  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=253) what does love even mean if god loves  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=255) everybody the same and there are no  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=257) gradients of love loving less not loving  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=260) loving more these are all gradients of  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=262) love that we find in the quran in  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=263) islamic  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=265) narrative but in christianity if god  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=267) loves everybody the same impartially  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=269) that means how do we even have a way of  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=271) approaching god or know what god wants  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=274) us to do if he loves us all impartially  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=277) anyway from the get-go from the outside  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=280) and what does it mean is love is  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=281) unconditional that means there's no  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=283) condition placed on god's love that  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=284) means  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=285) the psychopathic murderer she could feel  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=288) secure and happy knowing that god loves  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=290) him anyway because it's an unconditional  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=293) love like the craig therefore presents  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=295) but this again is contrary in fact to  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=297) the bible itself because in the bible  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=299) itself we do find verses where god does  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=302) not love some people in the book of  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=304) hosea for example chapter 9 verse 5 5 it  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=307) says because of their wickedness in  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=309) gilgal i hated them  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=312) right because of this wretchedness or  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=314) their rebellion i do not love them very  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=317) unequivocal language in psalm 5 5. god  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=320) does not love those who transgress and  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=322) do wrong in psalm 5 5 in psalm 139 it  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=326) says something similar right that  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=329) what do i do with those who hate you i  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=331) hate them i have all full hatred for  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=334) them in fact eric peel the dutch  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=336) theologian says that the most  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=338) absolute form of hatred is used in this  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=341) verse even thomas aquinas in his  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=343) comments from psalm 5 5 says that god  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=345) hates sinners  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=347) right that they're not sufficient  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=349) before god's majesty before god so  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=352) therefore it seems these are like newer  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=354) kind of trends coming from christian  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=355) missionaries about god loving everybody  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=357) maybe  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=358) maybe it's a ploy  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=359) in order to propagate their faith and to  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=361) invite more people to christianity but  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=363) but the bible isn't saying that and nor  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=366) are christian theologians particularly  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=367) of the past saying that that god loves  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=369) everybody the same way impartially that  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=372) means even me as a muslim who denies  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=375) christianity and denies of the core  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=377) tenets of christianity of incarnation of  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=380) jesus as a savior uh  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=383) god would love me as as he loves other  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=385) people  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=386) unconditionally i mean i don't have to  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=388) change or anything of course christians  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=389) wouldn't argue they said no there has to  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=390) be change and you have to whatever but  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=392) the point is not just through my service  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=394) of anybody really so  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=396) that wouldn't really work in light of  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=398) the bible or in light of just  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=399) logical sense and what about god  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=402) therefore loving universally that means  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=404) the same thing that god loves everybody  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=406) and everything the same way  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=408) of course this wouldn't make much sense  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=411) to say that because it wouldn't give  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=413) human beings that incentive that drive  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=415) to want to do good things in order to  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=418) love god or be loved by god because if  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=422) god loves them already anyway then what  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=424) really would the point of that be  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=426) and some people in fact would argue some  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=428) people would argue against it by saying  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=429) well you know people's love for god  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=431) should drive them to want to do good  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=433) things for them and i understand that  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=434) point as well but other people would  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=435) argue  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=436) what's the point anyway and anyway islam  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=438) doesn't have that problem  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=440) it doesn't have that problem because  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=442) what does islam actually say  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=443) it says number one the thing that is  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=446) universal from god to all of humanity is  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=449) the divine mercy of god remember we've  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=452) discussed it already in light of the  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=454) adamic conundrum in light of human  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=456) salvation model  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=457) god's divine mercy and that divine mercy  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=460) is in everything so the prophet of allah  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=463) says that that in the lillahi  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=465) allah has a hundred parts of his mercy  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=470) allah has sent one part of his mercy  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=472) between humans and jinn and even beasts  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=475) right even animals even the hadith says  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=478) well hawaiian even insects share from  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=480) that one part of that divine mercy that  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=482) means that mercy of god really is in  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=484) everybody  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=486) and people when you see  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=488) you know acts of goodness or kindness or  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=490) mercy or sympathy or empathy or love  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=492) uh  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=493) or you're only seeing a small tiny  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=496) fragment of something that's in your  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=498) life but think about the whole of  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=500) creation from the beginning to the end  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=501) of time and all of everything that you  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=503) see and you will never see in your life  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=505) is all from that one part of allah's  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=507) divine mercy that's mercy isn't  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=509) everything even those who disbelieve in  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=511) him allah is still merciful unto them  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=513) how is allah merciful and to all people  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=515) that allah allows and shows even the  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=518) wretched most wretched person at any  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=520) time a chance to come back to god  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=524) right that's that's powerful that  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=526) allah's mercy is such that even the most  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=528) wretched individual has at any point in  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=531) time any point in his life to go back to  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=533) god through repentance and he will find  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=535) god forgiving allah says  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=541) i am forgiving  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=544) for the one who repents  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=546) and believes and works good deeds and  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=549) then follows a life of righteousness i  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=552) am forgiving on that person so therefore  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=554) that that path is always open for  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=556) anybody the path of forgiveness and  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=558) mercy and closeness and love of god but  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=561) to say therefore at the outset god loves  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=563) everybody it wouldn't really it's i mean  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=564) it might sound nice on the tongue but it  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=566) doesn't really make that much actually  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=567) of sense and christian theologians would  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=569) argue i mean some people in fact really  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=572) argue against william craig for saying  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=574) such things because the bible in fact  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=575) doesn't teach that doesn't preach that  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=578) and therefore it's really an incorrect  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=580) way of of of interpreting the christian  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=583) faith as well  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=584) uh so that's one thing therefore that he  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=586) says in his argument that the love of  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=588) god in islam is like this and in  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=590) christianity it's an all-encompassing  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=592) it's a universal impartial and  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=594) unconditional love we've shown therefore  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=596) that that actually is is an incorrect  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=598) premise and incorrect  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=599) analysis of the islamic position as well  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=602) the second thing that he argues in fact  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=604) in the same section or same area is he  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=607) says you see the love of god  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=609) is such that  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=611) god calls on christians to be loving to  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=615) be loving to their enemies  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=617) and he says you see that's unique  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=618) because in islam you don't have loving  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=620) your enemies  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=622) and again it might sound nice on the  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=624) tongue while loving your enemies okay  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=626) what does that actually mean it's  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=627) important for all of us to look closely  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=629) at every argument being made and to  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=630) dissect it and to unpack it and to  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=632) unpeel it and to look closely because  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=634) these are our major problems and i  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=636) believe that if christians are sincere  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=638) and they look closely they'll see the  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=640) fallacy of these of these own arguments  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=642) so he says for example in the book of  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=644) matthew it says that you know jesus says  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=646) love your enemies  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=648) love your enemies like you love  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=649) yourselves love your enemies  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=651) now what does love actually mean how do  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=653) you define does the bible define love  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=657) how do you love i know i know how to  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=658) love me i could say i love god i love my  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=661) mother i love my wife my children i you  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=663) have you know what love might mean  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=665) what does it mean to love your enemies  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=668) and what must your enemies be doing or  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=670) not doing in order for you to love them  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=673) or not love them  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=674) right do you love the one who is  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=676) murdering your family do you love that  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=677) person and how do you show that love as  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=680) well  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=681) it's one thing to verbalize in fact it's  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=683) one thing to feel not even verbalizing  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=685) is wanting to feel and say i love a  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=687) person if that love is not verbalized  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=690) it's a problem if that love isn't  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=692) actualized it's another problem so what  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=694) does love actually mean therefore now of  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=696) course in the bible we're also taught  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=698) and shown the way that loving one  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=700) enemies is demonstrated in fact in the  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=702) bible it says which means which means  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=705) that when your enemy is hungry feed him  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=708) when your enemy is thirsty give him  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=710) drink no i could understand that  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=712) but then for craig to make an argument  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=714) that islam doesn't have something  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=715) similar  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=716) is again a gross gross error and this is  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=719) too many of them from our christian  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=721) friends because in the quran we have  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=723) something similar in fact allah praises  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=726) those companions of the prophet muhammad  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=728) in the quran  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=739) it says that they the prophet's  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=741) companions feed believers feed  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=744) right  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=746) out of their love for allah  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=749) their if their motivation is the love of  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=751) allah right who do they feed  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=754) the poor miskin the orphans and the  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=758) prisoners of war  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=760) prisoners of war of course are enemy  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=762) prisoners of war right and they say we  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=765) feed you  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=768) for the sake of allah  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=770) or they think or they feel or they say  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=772) we feed you for the sake of allah  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=774) we don't want for the face of allah we  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=777) don't want from you any reward or any  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=780) gratitude or any thanks everything we're  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=782) doing is completely and solely for the  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=784) love of allah wa ta'ala that's a  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=786) demonstration of  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=788) feeding captives and of course in  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=790) islamic history there's a lot of  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=791) examples of that of feeding captives  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=793) whoever they are christian captives or  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=795) whoever they are you know  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=797) in my book on being human how islam  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=800) addresses othering demonization and  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=801) empathy my last chapter is about the  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=803) genocide in rwanda 1994 where i discuss  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=806) at length the way that muslims in fact  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=808) save the lives of countless christians  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=810) and fed them and gave them drink and hid  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=812) them as as muslims to save their lives  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=815) and all but these things are quite  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=816) common they can't happen of course in  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=818) our world people they do those things  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=820) but in islam of course we also have  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=821) guidelines about you know showing  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=824) preferential treatment  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=827) showing goodness to even enemies who are  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=829) prisoners of war and um and dealing with  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=832) them you know with that kind of a  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=833) kindness or feeding them and so  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=835) therefore the bible therefore has this  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=836) but so too does the quran in fact have  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=838) there's not an argument therefore to be  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=839) made  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=840) and therefore he also makes the case  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=841) therefore that  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=843) in islam we don't have this sense of  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=846) you know of love towards other people or  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=850) you know loving god for example loving  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=852) god and god loving people even though of  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=854) course the quran also says  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=856) that about the believers  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=859) that they  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=861) that god loves them and they love god  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=864) and so therefore the way that love is  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=865) reflected in islam even love towards  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=867) other people has been shown very clearly  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=869) in the quran  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=870) and in the life of the prophet muhammad  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=872) himself peace be upon him in fact the  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=874) prophet one says to his companion  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=877) he says to aquarius  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=879) he says  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=880) join relations with those that cut off  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=882) from you  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=884) and give to those who deny you  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=887) and pardon those who wrong you he says  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=889) don't be like those who who say that i'm  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=892) going to be good to those if they're  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=893) good to me meaning have a much higher  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=895) paradigm of service to people of  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=898) kindness to people the quran in fact has  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=901) many examples like that it praises those  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=903) who subdue their anger who pardon people  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=906) who give to others who give in charity  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=908) who kind of have all these beautiful  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=909) attributes that praises those people so  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=912) therefore it is an incorrect premise for  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=913) christians like craig to argue therefore  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=915) the quran has no concept like these  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=918) whereas in the bible we're told to love  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=919) one's enemies and to love people in fact  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=922) the beautiful tradition in the prophet's  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=923) life is that he said peace be upon  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=931) the merciful ones are those whom the all  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=933) merciful shows mercy towards be merciful  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=936) with those in the earth and the one in  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=938) the heavens will be merciful unto you so  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=940) therefore we've illustrated therefore in  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=942) this very short episode the way that  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=944) craig's third argument really falls flat  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=947) on its face it's an incorrect argument  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=949) it's not true it's selective quoting or  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=952) failing to analyze or look closely and  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=954) and and critically at one's own faith as  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=957) well as the faith of islam as well uh a  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=960) lot of us to end on therefore is a  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=961) beautiful verse where allah says  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=968) in light of the argument craig made of  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=970) course that we discussed in this episode  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=972) about god loves everybody and loves  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=974) everybody the same way  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=975) allah says  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=977) should we treat  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=979) the  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=979) criminals as we treat those who submit  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=982) to us  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=986) what is amiss with you look at how  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=988) you're judging now another very big  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=991) point made by our christian friends and  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=993) this has been said of course  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=994) almost wherever you meet christian  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=996) missionaries or apologize they say this  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=998) it's almost are they scripted to say  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1000) this that they say that  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1002) in christianity it is faith that saves  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1006) them  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1006) and not works that save them whereas in  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1009) islam they say islam is a faith islam  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1011) islam is a religion of works many many  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1013) works five pillars of islam and praying  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1014) and fasting and pilgrimage and these  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1017) things they think save them muslims  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1020) from sin and bring them closer to god's  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1023) to god's pleasure whereas in  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1024) christianity it's just faith in jesus  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1026) christ as the atoner and and therefore  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1029) then you are saved let's think about  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1030) this very carefully now the first thing  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1032) is this we've got to remember that not  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1034) all christians in fact say this they  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1035) differ amongst themselves catholics  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1037) would say that faith and work save youth  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1040) in the book of james in fact james  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1042) stresses that in fact james argues with  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1044) paul about that you know when he says  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1046) that it is not just faith that savior it  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1049) is also works that save you what use is  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1051) is is faith if there is no works because  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1053) there's no representation of that faith  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1055) in the person's claim that he in fact  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1057) does have faith and doesn't believe in  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1059) james is very strong in this  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1060) um  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1061) but others for example like the  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1063) protestants they would say uh it's faith  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1065) alone that saves you and maybe works  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1068) therefore come out as you know as a  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1070) product of one's faith um and therefore  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1074) not  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1074) that the works themselves will save you  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1076) find this kind of a kind of a tangent  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1078) there between them which i understand  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1080) maybe what they're saying but what is  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1082) how does islam approach this whole thing  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1084) islam stresses of course that the  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1085) primary  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1086) thing about faith is of course having  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1088) the correct belief about god it can't be  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1091) that you're believing in uh you know in  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1095) a tree or in the sun as a deity and then  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1098) of course you're doing good deeds even  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1101) though you're doing good deeds your  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1102) faith is is the biggest problem your  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1104) belief is the biggest problem  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1106) so  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1107) it can't be that you're calling upon  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1108) mary and calling upon jesus and then  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1111) you're doing great works because your  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1113) your belief is a fundamental problem  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1115) because then who is it that your heart  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1117) is inclined to in your performing of  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1120) those good works in the first place it  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1122) should be that full reverence and love  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1124) is shown to god alone  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1126) alone who has no partners  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1128) even the old testament verses are  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1129) calling upon this as opposed to you know  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1132) making the holy spirit for example that  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1134) my heart is for the holy spirit i'm  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1136) calling holy spirit and that's what i'm  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1138) doing my good deeds for the holy spirit  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1140) and and for the father and for jesus uh  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1144) and am i imagining them as one soul  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1147) entity or as three distinct persons with  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1149) two different personalities and of  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1150) course christians have argued about this  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1152) forever about what actually was actually  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1154) happening here and christians differ and  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1156) there's different kind of heresies  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1158) involved in this because if you say the  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1159) wrong thing you could become deemed a  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1161) heretic  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1162) but islam doesn't have that problem  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1164) because that's not god that isn't god  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1166) right  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1167) now  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1169) what is your impression of the lord of  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1170) the worlds it isn't that that isn't the  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1172) impression of the lord of the worlds  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1173) allah is supreme majestic  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1177) all exalted  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1178) all merciful allah is bigger than allah  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1181) is bigger than all of that and so  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1183) therefore where christians argue and  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1184) have this debate amongst themselves  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1185) about faith and works what does islam  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1187) say about that so therefore islam  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1189) emphasizes number one you have to have  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1190) the correct belief belief in god alone  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1192) that's that's the main thing about your  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1194) belief has to be has to be correct and  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1196) then of course what that belief  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1198) represents is three things in islam  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1200) we're taught that belief is three things  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1203) it is to be convinced in your heart  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1206) about something about that belief that  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1207) god is one deserving of full worship  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1210) number two that's verbalized in your  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1213) tongue we say  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1215) muhammad rasool allah none deserve  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1217) worship except allah and indeed muhammad  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1219) is his messenger upon him be peace so  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1222) therefore to verbalize with your tongue  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1223) to be convicted and then to act it out  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1225) with your limbs so the limbs for are a  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1228) manifestation of that belief  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1230) the actions therefore are proof of that  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1232) belief the actions themselves are not  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1236) going to save anybody not the actions  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1237) themselves because the prophet in fact  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1239) in hadith said that none of you will  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1241) enter heaven no one enters paradise by  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1244) his deeds by his works the prophet's  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1246) companions were amazing it's not even  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1248) you a messenger of allah knowing of  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1250) course this man prays all night and he  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1252) fast in the day and there's so many good  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1253) deeds not even the prophet of allah and  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1256) the prophet muhammad says not even me  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1258) except if allah was to shower me and  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1260) cover me with his grace and his mercy  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1263) only then am i saved which is  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1265) emphasizing for us a very key point that  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1267) our christian friends oftentimes miss  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1270) oftentimes miss this tradition  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1273) right that it is not the fate it's not  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1275) the works itself that saves anybody it  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1278) is god's mercy that saves anybody right  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1281) but the works are a manifestation of  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1283) belief they are a proof of belief  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1285) otherwise you have an empty claim i  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1288) claim that i am a generous person but  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1290) i've never done act of charity in my  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1292) life what would that mean  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1294) what would that mean for me to say i am  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1296) a generous person but i have nothing to  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1298) my account of ever sharing generosity  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1300) but i still believe i'm a generous  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1302) person or by saying therefore i am a  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1304) person of great empathy but you've never  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1306) actualized or verbalized that empathy on  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1309) anybody for anything but i just think in  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1311) my heart that i'm an empathetic person  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1313) empathic person no it doesn't work like  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1315) that means that the actions are proof of  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1318) one's a manifestation of one's belief  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1320) but the actions themselves don't save  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1322) anybody it is a divine mercy of allah  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1325) the second thing our christian friends  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1326) often say is that we have grace in our  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1329) faith we have grace god's divine grace  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1331) whereas islam has works which again  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1333) is a complete misrepresentation of islam  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1336) let me tell you something there is a  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1338) recurring repeated motif in the quran  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1341) about the grace of god for example allah  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1344) says more than three four times  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1350) if it was not for the grace and the  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1352) mercy of allah one  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1354) allah is all  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1356) repent repent for repenting mean  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1359) accepting of repentance and allah is all  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1361) wise and allah gandan says another place  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1365) if it was not for the grace of allah's  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1366) mercy the grace of allah and his mercy  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1369) and allah is all compassion and all  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1371) merciful again allah says if it was not  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1373) for the grace and mercy of allah then  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1375) none of you would have attained to  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1376) purification  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1377) right so allah is saying again and again  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1379) that it's the grace and the mercy of  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1381) allah that is upon us in all the things  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1383) that we do nothing emerges from our own  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1385) wisdom intelligence and but you know all  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1388) of this we're all subjects and all weak  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1390) and impoverished before god and  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1392) everything that we do do of goodness has  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1394) been aided has been facilitated has been  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1396) inspired and shown to us by god himself  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1399) and then when we do it god of course is  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1400) appreciative for the things that we do  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1402) which is another beautiful attribute of  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1403) allah that allah is a shakur so where  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1406) christians for example argue that well  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1407) you know god is never happy with  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1409) anything we do because anything we do is  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1410) never worthy of god and therefore jesus  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1412) is death the blood sacrifice is what's  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1414) going to be worthy of god  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1416) allah  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1417) on the other hand opposite to that says  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1420) allah is  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1422) forgiving and allah is appreciative  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1424) allah knows every single one of us our  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1427) life circumstances our hearts our minds  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1430) our all ours our whole situations our  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1432) pre-narratives our experiences our  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1434) limitations our strengths our weaknesses  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1436) all of that in all of us  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1438) and allah therefore said he is  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1440) appreciative what can i say  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1442) when allah says to the people of heaven  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1444) in the next life in heaven allah will  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1446) say that you know your efforts were  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1447) appreciated  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1448) your struggles and trudges in life were  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1451) appreciated so therefore we should bear  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1453) that in mind that's another detraction  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1456) you know from our christian friends and  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1458) william and craig and others and some of  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1460) the quran therefore sheds beautiful  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1461) light on in the way therefore we should  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1463) be seeing it may allah bless all of you  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1466) i mean  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/fFkGbBAgy1s?t=1473) you
