The other possibility is that Israel is planning a devastating attack on Iran, possibly targeting key infrastructure and political figures.  The speaker, however, argues for a preemptive strike by Iran, targeting key Israeli infrastructure, as a defensive measure to prevent a larger attack.

## 107.439s:  Inheritance and the Quran 
**Is there a need to review the Quranic verses on inheritance?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that he initially did not think a review of the Quranic verses on inheritance was necessary. However, he encountered  deeper problems in inheritance calculations and discovered that there are two major schools of thought on this matter. He also mentions that there are variations and mistakes in these interpretations, and these need to be addressed.

## 143.92s:  Major Schools of Thought on Inheritance 
**What are the two major schools of thought on inheritance?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that there are two main schools of thought on inheritance law. One, followed by most Madhahib except Imami and Zahiri, is considered the more common school. The other school is attributed to Al-Bayt Ibn Abbas and is considered more reasonable and consistent with the Quran's text.

## 181.76s:  Inheritance and the Imami School 
**Which school of thought is adopted by the Imami Jafari School?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker indicates that the Imami Jafari School adopts the second school of thought, attributed to Al-Bayt Ibn Abbas. While he is uncertain if the Zahiri School also follows this approach, there is a high probability they do. He emphasizes the importance of discussing these issues on their own merit rather than focusing on which school adheres to them.

## 237.12s:  Inheritance: The Problem of Over-Subscription
**What is the main problem encountered in allocating inheritance portions?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker introduces the problem of over-subscription, where allocating all the designated shares for heirs leads to a total exceeding 100%. He uses the example of a woman who dies with a husband and two daughters. The husband is entitled to a quarter of the inheritance, while the daughters, according to the first ayah of inheritance, receive two-thirds. This creates a total of 125%, exceeding the total wealth.

## 325.84s:  Inheritance: Prioritization of Debts and Obligations
**How are debts and obligations prioritized in inheritance law?**

**The Speaker**:  The speaker explains the order of prioritization in inheritance law. First, debts and obligations are settled, including Zakat, loans, and funeral expenses. The funeral expenses must be paid according to the deceased person's status. After all debts and obligations are settled, the will is addressed.

## 383.759s:  Inheritance and Wills
**What are the restrictions on wills in inheritance law?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker clarifies that a will cannot exceed one-third of the deceased person's wealth. He also highlights that wills cannot include heirs' shares, as those are already designated by Allah. However, if a will mentions a non-heir who becomes an heir later due to the death of another person, the judge or lawyer needs to address this by deducting that portion from the will.

## 4595.12s:  Understanding the Final Ayah of Inheritance
**What is the essence of the final ayah of the inheritance chapter?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that the final ayah of the inheritance chapter addresses the case of someone dying without any children or parents. In such situations, the inheritance goes to brothers and sisters, with the male inheriting twice the share of the female. This ayah clarifies the rules for inheriting in the absence of direct heirs.

## 4872.32s:  Clarifying the Meaning of "The Unhappy Brother"
**What does the term "the unhappy brother" refer to in inheritance law?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker refers to a specific case often referred to as "the unhappy brother." This involves a deceased woman leaving a husband, a daughter, and a son of a son. The speaker challenges the traditional interpretation, where the son of the son inherits a sixth, potentially causing hardship for the daughter. He argues that this interpretation leads to over-subscription and proposes a different calculation that avoids this issue.

## 5416.96s:  Inheritance Laws for Non-Muslims
**Do inheritance laws apply differently if inheritors are non-Muslims?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that, in general, Muslims cannot inherit from non-Muslims. He cites a dissenting view from the time of the Sahaba, arguing that Islam increases and is therefore superior. However, he considers this argument faulty,  highlighting the hadith of Salman which states that Muslims cannot inherit from non-Muslims and vice versa.

## 5693.28s:  Applying Islamic Inheritance Law in Non-Islamic Societies
**Can Islamic inheritance law be applied in non-Islamic societies?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker clarifies that applying Islamic inheritance law in non-Islamic societies requires creating a will that adheres to the local legal system. This would involve recording the inheritance distribution according to the specific laws of the country, such as in England, where wills are legally binding.

## 6424.32s:  Reading Between the Lines: Importance of Context
**Why is reading between the lines in Islamic texts crucial for understanding their nuances?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding context and reading between the lines in Islamic texts. He uses the example of a story about two women playing drums in the Prophet's presence to demonstrate how the meaning can be misinterpreted if the context is not considered. He highlights the potential for misunderstanding when people cling to isolated words or phrases without analyzing their context.

## 6833.599s:  The Importance of Comprehensive Quranic Analysis
**How crucial is a comprehensive analysis of the Quran for accurate understanding?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker stresses the necessity of comprehensive Quranic analysis. He criticizes the common practice of interpreting isolated phrases or ayahs without considering the context of the entire surah or even related surahs. He argues that this fragmented approach leads to misunderstanding and confusion. 

## 6910.96s:  Challenging Misinterpretations of Islamic Texts
**What is the speaker's goal in addressing these misinterpretations?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker acknowledges that the field of Islamic scholarship needs a major overhaul to address the misinterpretations that have plagued it. He emphasizes the need for consistent analysis and interpretation, based on the Quran and Sunnah, to ensure that people can truly benefit from these texts. 


## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byeVr9SWZZU

##  The Speaker asks: At the beginning, we waited for the first speech of Hass, it was unfortunate the way he formulated it and we at that time already stated that he said if we are attacked in Lebanon, and we said the word "attack" in Lebanon is a catastrophe; it turned out to be a catastrophe; it seems that there were many indications that he was forced by Iran to do that out of wisdom.  
**Category:**  Political Analysis

The speaker suggests that Hassan Nasrallah was forced by Iran to make a statement regarding a potential attack on Lebanon. This statement was seen as a weakness and contributed to the current situation. The speaker believes Nasrallah's comments were ultimately detrimental to Hezbollah's position.

Don't be fooled by all this baloney; Israel is rebelling against it.

**Category:** Political Conspiracy 

The speaker claims that US President Biden gave Israel a direct order to completely annihilate Hezbollah during a 6-hour meeting. The speaker suggests that this order was recorded and that if the US does not comply, the evidence will be released to the world, leading to Biden's downfall. 

## The Speaker asks:  Independent of that, true or not, that occasion was missed. They could have taken the occasion and say, "Listen, we require the application of the order of the World Court within maybe a week, two weeks, one month, a reasonable time, otherwise, we will regard ourselves as at liberty to retaliate against Israeli citizens, or something like that."
**Category:** Political Strategy

The speaker argues that Hezbollah missed an opportunity to leverage the International Court of Justice's ruling on genocide by not issuing a clear ultimatum to Israel, threatening retaliation if their orders were not followed within a specific timeframe. This, the speaker believes, would have been a strong and effective deterrent.

## The Speaker asks: There was the assassination of -- they missed that. But just attack, and the rumors is that the current appointee for the leadership -- already appointed -- maybe I'm not sure if he's formally appointed and announced as such, uh Sheik Hashim --  advised that say we have to we should do but wanted to hedge the position and be more in the soft side because certain considerations which may be is is a phy the consideration is that this way will prevent an attack against Lebanon.
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker claims that the new Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hashim, is taking a more cautious approach, seeking to avoid provoking Israel. He argues that this strategy is a mistake, as Israel's attack on Lebanon is inevitable. The speaker believes that a more proactive strategy is necessary to prevent further harm.

## The Speaker asks: But that's a mistake because the attack against Lebanon is in was inevitably coming if you see the reality, but when they finish with they will you by destroying you, you should not have get them the opportunity to breathe and organize himself and at that time you would have the initiative of so they missed that other occasion.
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker argues that Hezbollah should have taken a more aggressive stance against Israel and launched an attack rather than waiting for Israel to strike first. The speaker believes that by allowing Israel to dictate the terms of engagement, Hezbollah has placed itself in a vulnerable position. 

## The Speaker asks:  Now we'll see if they don't miss it, or don't miss it because now there's nothing of missing. Just few hours ago, I think the Israelis started the invasion, the land invasion in Lebanon, and they will continue until they defeated. There's no escape now. They have to fight for their life. Obviously, we pray pray to hope that they will ultimately end Victorious, but there's no, inevitably, the first phase will be massive against hisb. There will be plenty of Bloodshed, tens of thousands. 
**Category:** Military Situation

The speaker confirms that Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, escalating the conflict. The speaker acknowledges the gravity of the situation, expecting heavy casualties on both sides. The speaker remains hopeful for Hezbollah's victory but emphasizes that the fighting will be brutal and costly.

## The Speaker asks: I don't think only thousand 1,600, it's a dream if someone thinks 1,600. All the will be killed from civilian, then he doesn't know what is and America all about. We will end maybe with 20, 30,000 kill yes, or even maybe more, is a is real calamity, which shows the mistake of not taking the initiative and not seeing that all the American action was to give Israel time to finish Gaza and then turn to the and think that even if they even the facts now Pro that even if they cannot finish but I just keep it under siege, right, so that they can withdraw some forces, they will attack Lebanon anyway.
**Category:** Military Analysis

The speaker predicts that the conflict will result in a high number of casualties, likely exceeding 1,600 and reaching as high as 20,000 or 30,000. The speaker blames Hezbollah's failure to take initiative for this tragic outcome, suggesting that the US deliberately allowed Israel to conquer Gaza before shifting focus to Lebanon. 

## The Speaker asks: Now, I argue, just let me do the argument and come to comment about IR. That it's almost certain that Iran will be attacked whatever they do, if they do anything or do nothing, the attack is almost inevitably coming. There are rumors from some people who seem to be deep inside the Saudi regime, and others, that the plans and the targets are already fixed, and assisted for that bombers in R Garcia and the gulf, and so are ready for that. 
**Category:** Military Forecast 

The speaker argues that Iran is likely to be attacked by Saudi Arabia regardless of their actions. This attack is reportedly planned, with targets already selected, and bombers deployed in readiness. The speaker cites sources within the Saudi regime to support this claim. 

## The Speaker asks:  They are ready for that. Additionally, the recent behavior of Iran encouraged them to see that Iran are cowed or afraid, and they're hedging and they want to get away. The moment you, the enemy, sees that you are afraid, and you want to get away, the sheep say that's the time to smash the other one, otherwise, we don't get that point, any other time. 
**Category:** Military Psychology

The speaker believes that Iran's recent hesitant behavior has emboldened Saudi Arabia to attack. The speaker uses the analogy of a predator recognizing weakness in prey, suggesting that Iran's fear and desire to avoid conflict make them vulnerable to an attack.

## The Speaker asks:  So recently, uh, with the recent event, uh, this new president, M Khan, his but his name pronounced will be pronounced, he said, we did not take revenge for because the American promised family that within a week they will have a ceasefire negotiated, and uh and then would seize the activity, and we think this is a good, and also, I think he said that, or some other people exposed it, they promise to cancel a good good amount of sanctions, cancel sanctions, is a good target also, is not is not a betrayal to to not take revenge in return of sanction and and seize fire, this is a good price. 
**Category:** Political Negotiation

The speaker discusses the Iranian government's decision not to retaliate for US sanctions and instead accept a ceasefire agreement. The speaker argues that this was a good decision, citing the promise of sanctions relief as a reasonable trade-off for forgoing immediate revenge.  

## The Speaker asks: There's no problem with that, but the problem is that one week pass, nothing, and we, two pass, you should have a secret deadline. You promise within one week, okay. One week may not work. Two weeks, next week, we will retaliate. There's no question, we're not going to accept your claims and your promises now. This himself say, this turns out to be all complete lies. 
**Category:** Political Criticism 

The speaker expresses frustration with the US's failure to follow through on promised sanctions relief and a ceasefire agreement. The speaker criticizes the US for lying and breaking their promises, arguing that this behavior has undermined trust and necessitates a stronger response.

## The Speaker asks: This shows that at least he is a simpleton, and a Gable idiot, at least if not a traitor, because until now, now he's not moving in the right direction to the tune that Iranian people, now minority, were demonstrating in at the at the site of the the building of the National Security Council, demanding that the the instruction of Kamai, which seems to be they are aware about that, to take retaliation should be executed, and they are threatening badan and his Deputy zarif, no Zar is American agent, he's not a symbol idiot, an American agent.
**Category:** Political Discord

The speaker suggests that the Iranian president is either incompetent or a traitor, failing to act on the demands of the Iranian people to retaliate against the US. The speaker also accuses the Iranian foreign minister of being a US agent, highlighting the deep divisions within the Iranian leadership. 

## The Speaker asks: And also, it seems to be that Iranian think the situation is serious, and the possibility of assassination is on is is really on the table, so they they moved Kamai to undisclosed place. No, so the situation is very critical now. 
**Category:** Political Instability 

The speaker describes a tense and potentially volatile situation in Iran. The speaker suggests that the Iranian government is taking precautions to protect key figures, including moving officials to undisclosed locations, due to fears of assassination. The speaker highlights the seriousness of the situation. 

## The Speaker asks: Still, there's there's a possibility that this idiot, if he's an idiot, not a traitor, that he may think not taking a retaliation and not supporting hisbah will save Iran. He's mistaken. The attack with is coming in. 
**Category:** Political Miscalculation

The speaker believes that the Iranian president is making a critical miscalculation by avoiding retaliation, believing it will prevent an attack. The speaker insists that the attack is inevitable and that Iran's inaction will only weaken their position. 

## The Speaker asks: And there's also rumor going on. I think it's not a rumor, a piece of news really, that is threatened America, threatened Iran. We will strike you if if you come to support, attack us, we will strike you. Threatening really, flexing the muscle. 
**Category:** Military Threat

The speaker reports that the US has directly threatened Iran with retaliation if they support Hezbollah's actions. The speaker describes this as a clear flexing of military power and an attempt to deter Iranian involvement.

## The Speaker asks: The point which is yeah, if the is threat is seriously be taken and they are they sufficient blood thirsty to be expected to do worse things fine. But the problem is not to see that the suggest to get the opportunity to finish as they believe they would be able and then they will strike. And if they don't succeed even finishing but slim it down and push it a little bit back and get the breathing opportunity, they will attack Iran. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker warns that the US is willing to take drastic measures against Iran. The speaker emphasizes that the US intends to maximize its gains and is willing to strike even if a complete victory is not achieved.  

## The Speaker asks: And there even rumors that even the United States of America already have finished their plans and so on, and they will take the opportunity to settle that, not for for them. So it will it is a high time that that the Irani leadership recognizes that it's now the matter of the attack is coming inevitably since it's coming almost inevitably or inevitably, then you have to benefit from situation to take the initiative, because if you take the initiative you can harm the enemy. 
**Category:** Political Action

The speaker emphasizes the urgency of the situation, stating that an attack on Iran is almost certain and that the Iranian government needs to take a decisive and proactive approach to defend themselves. The speaker believes that a preemptive strike is the best strategy.

## The Speaker asks: I would have taken someone was suggesting to me maybe then bombing the American bases in the G. That's a mistake, no, not bombing. Taking the initiative, meaning doing a good solid attack in against the building of the parliament, against the Mad headquarter, against the ministry of defense, against the Council of Ministers, please, the house of Netanyahu, all of these things, plus some other strategic targets, 40 50 hypersonics which Iran has, that's worth obviously supported other missiles ahead of them to satate that iron doome, but seems the iron doome is it's clearly showing failure with this isra will be having no no no other option except to to attack. 
**Category:** Military Tactics

The speaker suggests that Iran should launch a counterattack, not against US bases, but against Israeli targets. The speaker recommends a series of attacks against key Israeli government buildings and military installations using hypersonic missiles. 

## The Speaker asks: But then, we we'll see if the America start participating or there's any sign that the bases in the gulf and so on are are being used then Iran is watching the situation they initi in our hand they're looking what's going on and they can't bomb these then immediately just the next hour few hours later. So that's that the way it will go meanwhile also beside the attack inside side from from Iran itself, the resistance in Iraq should be giving a leeway and more more capability to attack the American bases in Iraq and Syria massively. 
**Category:** Military Coordination 

The speaker believes that Iran should take advantage of the US's potential involvement in the conflict and target US bases in the Gulf region immediately. Additionally, the speaker suggests that Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria should simultaneously launch attacks against US bases in those countries.

## The Speaker asks:  An attack of anation of Slaughter this way the American attack, which will come definitely, America has enough his assets, even if they b a bomb Z, they have still the day of gar they have other places, and they will do damage, it they will kill, but it will be my milder than without would be much milder than if they start. But if they start, they have the initiative; they can shoot targets, but now you will be in high El, you will be stand by, you do the strike against the Pres Iraq, will work on the long run, they they should be tell told or encouraged to tr all ride all American bases in Iraq and Syria as a Target as you because you are an independent over force, and if the Iraqi must come in the way then put them at build the sword stop them. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker argues that Iran and its allies should proactively launch a counterattack against US bases in the region. The speaker believes that a preemptive strike would minimize potential damage from a US retaliation and create a stronger defensive position.

## The Speaker asks: But we as a state we have to go follow certain procedures, which are dictated by international attack against is, or that what they did to, but positive, strong solid one, forcing the other side if they want to attack, or they to attack, they should execute that's it. 
**Category:** International Relations 

The speaker acknowledges that Iran must operate within international rules and procedures while still taking a decisive stance against US and Israeli aggression. The speaker emphasizes that Iran should not hesitate to retaliate if they face an attack. 

## The Speaker asks: So that's that's the way it works so that's it, but taking all evidences I think the the soal Deep State, or the the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Min of Defense, the all the administration, so on, is really deeply penetrated by the so-called what they call the Baha faction. There's a Baha faction, they control the Deep State, and it's on the Revolutionary God Islam, reary God to tell them this not allow to get away with this, if necessary, we'll take m in our hand by if necessary, you have to execute the orders of and you have to take a stand because you are endangering Iran and weakening it. 
**Category:** Political Conspiracy

The speaker alleges that the Iranian government is infiltrated by a "Baha faction" that controls the Deep State and is acting against the interests of the Islamic Republic. The speaker calls on religious authorities to intervene and prevent this faction from further weakening Iran. 

## The Speaker asks: You are not strengthening it, you think you are saving the people from and from the campaign, but is has shown clearly, they are the one who will start the genocide and destruction, and they will not rest until they attack ir. 
**Category:** Political Warning 

The speaker warns that the Iranian government's inaction is actually strengthening the US and Israel, setting the stage for a devastating attack on Iran. The speaker suggests that the government's inaction will ultimately lead to further suffering for the Iranian people. 

## The Speaker asks: And possibly, if we do it the correct way, the Americans will not have motivation to participate, and they may be terrified, because I think until now, I'm insisting, what the Americans are saying, the muscle flexing is a bluff, and the threats are above because there's no way they can succeed in anything substantially without nuclear weapons or without land invasion, which is impossible. Land invasion needs six months at least preparation, and question, where they should have their forces before the invasion in the Gulf, they will be attacked before that, next day, they'll be attacked. 
**Category:** Military Analysis

The speaker believes that US threats are hollow and that they lack the capacity to launch a successful attack on Iran without resorting to nuclear weapons or a lengthy ground invasion, both of which are highly unlikely. The speaker believes that the US is bluffing and that Iran should stand firm. 

## The Speaker asks: I don't think Iran, anybody in IR, is so stupid like Sadam, who let the Americans accommodate their forces, and so on, thinking that he can negotiate his way out of qu, instead of taking the all the east of Saudi Arabia and forcing the Americans to treat and say, okay, I give you that back, you go out and leave qu with me. 
**Category:** Historical Analysis

The speaker compares the current situation to Iraq under Saddam Hussein, arguing that Saddam's fatal mistake was allowing the US to build up its forces before launching a counterattack. The speaker suggests that Iran should learn from this history and take preemptive action. 

## The Speaker asks: He would have succeeded Almost 100%, and prevented even the accommodation of forces if you took the Eastern region of Saudi Arab if he has taken that 30 35 33 years ago, that who they would land in n, then they have to cross the desert which is almost, but he he failed to do that because he's dumb and stupid, and Allah has forsaken him, did not open his ey give him guidance, but I think the people in Iran are much more intelligent than that, and they should see, they should learn them from history. 
**Category:** Historical Lesson

The speaker argues that Iran is more capable than Saddam Hussein and should learn from his mistakes. The speaker believes that a more proactive strategy is crucial to prevent the US from gaining a foothold in the region. 

## The Speaker asks: The history is clear, you can't kick the American, but did it the did it, and you can't do better than that, but take the initiative and don't let the first strike come because the first strike will cause you much more blood than if you take the initiative. 
**Category:** Strategic Decision

The speaker urges Iran to take a proactive stance and launch a counterattack to minimize the damage that would result from a US or Israeli strike. The speaker acknowledges the inevitable bloodshed but believes that Iran will suffer more if they remain passive. 

## The Speaker asks: But blood will be shed, and it will be you are willing or you unwilling, so that's it, concerning it seems to be if it's true that Hashim saf is appointed, all indication that he's stronger, more devoted to fight, willing to attack T aib and U uh much more strict, and more some people say even bloodthirsty, or vicious, or or Reckless, or something like that.

## The Speaker asks: It's a welcome Reckless that's not recklessness, that's the right course of action, recklessness is that to start an attack and provoking a counter-attack, which would unconceivable, it will come, but counter-attack or the attack of is is on the plan for many years. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker defines true recklessness as provoking a counter-attack by launching an attack first, which would be detrimental. The speaker considers a preemptive counter-attack as the correct course of action, given that an attack from Israel is inevitable. 

## The Speaker asks: The P Affair show that they're working that in 15 years, these guys are working to an and theate Muslim of Palestine, when they will not seize and do it because they know if they don't do that they will disappear from the from the from the map. That's the only way they can survive for them is matter of life and death so you have to work on that level also for you, it should be a matter of life and death.
**Category:** Political Motivation

The speaker suggests that Israel's aggression stems from a desperation for survival, as they believe they will be wiped off the map if they do not act decisively against their enemies. The speaker calls for a similar level of resolve and commitment from Iran and its allies.

## The Speaker asks: So that's it, is the situation desperate or hopeless, like many people are now shaken, and many of the rats filthy rats coming from the hole, and filthy swine coming and and snorting and so on. Some of them under the B of sism, somebody of the national interest, some that that no, is not like that.

This is a very nice Channel, and the people doing analysis uh are very qualified, and the majority of them are not just realist, have moral values, but alista crook is really well about Lebanon and the Middle East, I think since the '90s and he was involved in negotiations, maybe he originally he was Intelligence services, my6 or something like that, and his analysis is as objective as you can get from anyone from the West, actually someone would say he's slightly positive inclined toward hisbah and admiring and respecting which is good.

**Answer:** The speaker criticizes the recent Iranian attack on Israel as weak and symbolic. The speaker also notes the significant expense for Israel and the US to intercept the drones, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of drones over more traditional weaponry.

## 1058.28s: ... I think that was a mistake, it was a mistake to do that, because if you beat the general prin, say, if you must beat, then you be T, so the other sign recognize that you are serious, that was interpreted wrongly, obviously, at that moment, they spend it, that it's ineffective, it doesn't mean anything and so on, and America sold this, this, this um, uh, media campaign as, as if present itself to, to, to the Iranian, that we are mediating, we don't want the warri to spread, and we are the one who are restrain the, I think, the later events have shown that they are lying, it's only Tri, it's already SE to move to give themselves time for preparation, evidence after that more planes and more tanking planes came to the area, putting the stage for whatever action needed down the road, then there was the assassination of RI which Iran covered up and claimed is technical, I don't believe it's a techn, I think it's is behind that, I almost certain about that, obviously, I cannot make an oath on that because I don't know, but it's almost certain that it's behind that, but the Iranian were, were really embarrassed and forced to, to, just if, if they announce that is behind that they would have been obliged to do something, massive action, but they still chicken out, especially this new pres turns out to be either an extremely appeaser of a maaf, or he is such a Gable symbol to thece, which has been shown later to be one most like the first one, if we have, if we give him some good credit, he just, just blatant idiot, even pep escopa, the famous Brazilian journalist who is following the war in Ukraine, the situation in the, in the Far East for now, for almost three decades, said everyone is shocked about the Simplicity and naivity of this man in the United Nation meeting recently.

The speaker also accuses Israel of assassinating an Iranian official and criticizes the Iranian leadership for being weak and cowardly.

## 1184.6s:  ... so Israel took more Liberty and the assassinating in, in, in, in the celebration for the inauguration of the new president and, U, that's uh, that obviously put on the spot, they must take revenge and they say they will take, but then this Gible man, this M, whatever his name, uh, believe that the American trickery because the American promised him that within one week, we have a cheese fire, and he thought right, we saw the idea itself for that will be good enough to, for, for, for the, uh, uh, the retaliation, ending the war, there, my ceasefire that would have been a good price, no problem, no, no issue with that, but the problem is that to believe that the Americans are serious in their effort, and they are not deceptive, and they are good intending, and seem to, he repeated that in the United Nation attend, so this man is dangerous, we have to watch him carefully and the Irani have to watch him carefully, and I think they're watching him now carefully, and there was a demonstration against, we'll come to that also, so one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks until eight weeks, it was clear that and then, even until, until the United, United Nation session in which during the his stay there Netanyahu gave a very arrogant bico speech insulting everyone in the world showing such an arrogance, which is unbelievable, and during his stay there, he gave the order to assassinate, so then was clear that Iran must respond, and then were demonstrations going on in Iran, and I think the demonstration is, I think, it's spontaneous by the people, but definitely, the, the IRG, the, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is, is pushing that for, and so on, there's R, almost that they, that also the was outraged, and all of these things whatever, these reports cannot be trusted 100%, because I have the feeling that Kamai is more, and the camp, and the Gbel, or the cowed camp of, of badan, but the days will show that it will come, all that will be shown, and they did the action of last week's Tuesday now the action of last week's Tuesday, U, was all in all, a solid good action, solid action, however, again it was relatively measured, yes, there was no civilian Target, I think this, I was what I would say it was good not to Target any restrict on Military, but uh, and military and security targs, I would have if I were in their place, I would have made all air, air Bas as a Target, have more hypersonics, and Ballistic, uh, the ballistic were usually used mostly because the accuracy is accuracy, accuracy is slightly less than the Hypersonic, but they mo used mostly to, to get the Aros system and, uh, David thinging and the, and, and iron doome, iron doome is ineffective in that iron doome is really for slow rockets, for Dron things like that, while the David sling is essentially the equivalent of the, of the, of the p system is for, for faster objects, and then the arrows really for Hypersonic and, and Ballistic, the, the problem with the ballistic is that they because of they high Target, they can be seen far away, and speed, they personic has spe, but because their target, their, their, their trajectory is, is relying on bistic, it shoots high, and then it falls down with by the falling, it gains speed, and when it hits, it is with hypers sonic speed, yes, but the problem in the high point, it is visible far away, because the high point could be like 1,200 kilom up, and this is easily visible from 3, 4,000, so the moment you shoot them from Iran, the moment they go up there, they say, when they high above Iraq, they are watched and followed by the radar and the continue watching them calculating their trajectory seeing what and then calculate ious interception points, when they enter the atmosphere or before the atmosphere, that's, that's, that's the theory while the Hypersonic flly just above the atmosphere or inside the atmosphere in such a way that they become visible very close just one minute, half a minute, and this very difficult to calculate a trajectory and reception point, so the ballistics were mostly used to, to engage the Aros system. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

**Answer:** The speaker analyzes the recent Iranian attack on Israel, praising it for being a "solid action" but critiquing its limited scope and effectiveness. The speaker suggests that Iran should have targeted Israeli military facilities with hypersonic missiles, noting the limitations of ballistic missiles in terms of visibility and interception.

## 1496.72s:  ... but see, even the AR system fail because in some places we saw almost 20 hits, like in this famous base which has been hammered nicely, uh, the majority, and the accuracy is not that seems to be that, they use something just as essentially to work as a decoy, but to do some damage, and, and, and, and, and does some explosive damage, but it seems to be the model they used is not the top accuracy because none of these seems to be the hitting the relevant building and, and, and ters, and things like that, while the hypersonics, all of them had the target almost precisely, so this have to be also understood and learned for the future, um, this, the hyponic, maybe in total, about 30, or something like that, while the rest is the, the ballistic, who were really intended mostly as a decoy, but they lose some damage when go through, and they hit also the, the, the Mad Head water in their place, I would have made the number much bigger, that's number one, that's the, the one point, the number much bigger, all airports, but also, I would have hmer the ministry of Defense which has a considerable compound, but it's a ESS a main building, double attack against thead headquarters, small attack, symbolic attack, or something, that maybe with a ballistic against Netanyahu's house, I know he's not there, I know we know he's in a banker, but doesn't matter, it's symbolic, and also the, the parliament, so to see that your political targets, you, you're attacked, supreme leader of a movement, which is equivalent to a head state, if that was a state, then similar facilities would be attack without mercy, and then the, other, uh, also they targeted important, one of the best, strongest, and farest reing Radars, one of the strongest in the world, one of the best America produced, and this seems to be T been demolished completely, so meaning the next attack the Aros system does not have the eye which looks far away, or one the most important eye which can detect the CR a bird and distance of 3,000 kilometers, so that's gone, that's finished, that's it's confirm these days, I think today it is confir, that's gone, so the head is good, but good have been stronger, much stronger, and, uh, giving a stronger message, that's I agree with that with mcregor, McGregor, he doesn't agree with the whole say, this is a set by the is, but say, independent of that, if you decided to do it, ignore it is a, or not, because you may share his point to be it's a, to withdraw to get you into trouble, and get the American get in, or something that let's assume is right or wrong, it doesn't matter, say, but the moment you decide to do it, the way they did it is too, too weak to give the necessary message, and I think he's right, this Con McGregor, who has his own program as appear judge Napolitan and other programs, and also is very frequently interviewed by George G in the mother of all talk shows, uh, so that's right, it should have been St up, and the issue then the communic is also interesting, the communic says in, in, in support for the heroic fight of Gaza and so on, so they mention Gaza, support for Gaza, secondly, in, in retaliation, I think it was the third one, I don't know what's the order and then in, in retaliation for the association of, and, and also in support for the people of Lebanon, because leanon they started hammering Lebanon, the dation of was connected with a severe huming of the uh, south subab of B, so that hints that these three areas will be taken into consideration for any future action, but it was not uh, but it was not said directly, and if you repeat your attack again, if you retaliate, if you respond to this attack, we will respond with much stronger atts, that's good, but responding to attack could be in various ways, obviously, when you read it at faces respond to the attack by attacking us at home, Iran, I would, if I were there, I would have said, if you respond to the attack, even by increasing the bombing of Gaza or continuing the bombing of the then we regard that as a response and become stronger, unfortunately, that was not formulated, and thus, the opportunity was going to make that clear and obvious, obviously, the usual spin, like in the that's the of October attack, they SP, like in the 4 of April, it was ineffective, and then some of the barking dogs or, or electronic flies of Saudi Arabia, andir oh, the, the WarHeads were just, were just empty there, was no WarHeads, the whole was a piece of theater, and the usual blubbery of, of crus the agents like Saudi Arabia, and so on, but that's all has been now refuted, and, uh, uh, it is really under claim, there's nothing has happened, most are intercepted or fell as usual, all rockets are usually either intercepted or fall in and populated an open area which is, has been proven 100% to be 100% Li, such lies that, and they still repeating it, maybe they want to convince themselves that they are getting away whatever it is, so that, uh, that that strike was good, was good, was solid, but is not the most solid one which would have the thir future, now after that again America came forward with the usual game of that, uh, but now in another language, that's, we, we advise is against attack the nuclear facilities, and then when Iran responded to the ISIS that they may attack the oil facilities and so on, that we will destroy all fac, all o facility from Aan all the way to, uh, to UA, they mention all the countries, the only exception was it was not mentioned by name, all other, including Iraq, Aan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, emirat bahin, but not mentioning of K which is significant, so that's, that's, that's what happened, and now we now back and forth attack, said no don't attack, we'll attack this, we don't attack this, as I said, we will respond strongly now, the ongoing discussion now is the following, what will happen, it seems to be Israel has no other option at the moment at least, Netanyahu at least for himself, but also, the, the public there because seem to be even, even soall liberals and so on, they say this is one lifetime opportunity to strike the nule program, uh, some of Dooms there are in America like Lind Graham and others say, we, we must help Israel attacking the nuclear program, this opport to take it out, etc, etc, the government say, we advise them against that, but we don't have no control over the action, that's what Biden said, and he had a very weak interview recently, he's wavering, nothing clear, is my feeling is that this is all, U, deceptive, uh, because meanwhile, and even before that, and meanwhile, more tanker and more fighter JS are sent to the area, so it's clearly something is being now prepared and ready for a possible stage, so, so uh, it seems to be that, uh, strike is coming, maybe would be stage right now, when we are talking, but most, most likely it's either tomorrow, the anniversary, the one year anniversary of the, of, the, of the 7th of October, will be tomorrow or it may be delayed for maximum, if it is ever delayed, uh, not after the election, before the election, like five to ten days, and it will be then, if it happen, either tomorrow or in five to ten days, most likely it is uh, to also to have some benefit for Biden, and, because it seems to be now almost clear that CA Harris winning is, is very remote is quite remote, unlikely, so they have to do something, and the assassination of Trump has not worked, and secondly, an attempt to do that now will lead to a civil war, so that's not the way to go, so the only way is to make the government sure that they are wise, they're managing the worldly Affair as it should be, and they, they can lead the country in a state, in a situation of war and for that, the best will be, for their point of view, the Twisted point of view, is to be engaging into Rob Strong action against Iran, and in that case, ISE, it, it would be most likely to take out so-called nuclear facilities, that, that's, that's, that's the strongest possibility, it could be all of it, it could be just, just deceptive, but it is, it does not seem that Israel can, can leave that aside, because they, they have failed in R, they strategically defeated, and now the Hamas and the other mujah and Jihad and so are starting the counterattacks against the Narin, nazarin Corridor, uh, RAF uh, the Philadelphia strip would be soon attacks would be starting there, and the daily we have ten, twenty injured and killed and so on, one tank, one machine taken, so it is going back as if we are starting 7th of October again, so that's, that's, there's no success here, at, at the Lebanese border, it seems to be Israel is, has failed until now, they admitted until that was sixty kill, and 100, something injured they live, just that, and they even announce names, and they have a funeral procession and all of these things, but I guess there are other sources claiming it, it's actually more closer to ten, full, that closer to

The speaker is asking for concrete examples of how Saudi Arabia has committed open kufr. They are looking for evidence from any source, including documents, personal accounts, or even just a list of actions taken by the Saudi government. They mention some examples, such as the presence of US military bases on Saudi land, the alliance of Saudi Arabia with non-Muslim countries against other Muslims, and the use of interest-based transactions (riba) in international trade. The speaker emphasizes that even within Saudi Arabia, the government allows and promotes riba through its banking system.

**Category:** Hadith Classification

**07.639s:** The speaker is asking what it means when a Hadith is described as "Hassan" after being relayed.

1. **Outwardly acceptable:** The isnād (chain of narrators) has a narrator whose trustworthiness is not yet confirmed, but who is not known for making mistakes or lying. 
2. **Famous for veracity:** The narrator is known for honesty, but not as reliable as a narrator of "Sahih" (authentic) hadiths.

2. **Those who reject "Hassan" Hadith:** They believe that only "Sahih" (authentic) Hadith should be used. 
3. **Those who do not accept "Hassan" Hadith but do accept "Sahih"**

This aligns with the general understanding of "Hassan" as being a strong, but not perfect, Hadith.

1. **No narrators accused of falsehood:**  The isnād must be free of known liars or unreliable narrators. 
2. **Not anomalous:** The Hadith must be consistent with other similar reports and not stand alone as an outlier.
3. **Multiple chains:**  The Hadith must have similar reports from more than one line of transmission, strengthening its credibility.

##  How to Identify True Prophecies 

**0:40.219s :  ** What are the conditions that must be met for a prophecy to be considered authentic? 
*Category: Prophecy Evaluation*

**Answer:**  For a prophecy to be considered authentic, three conditions must be met:

1. **Pre-Existing Documentation:** The prophecy must be documented before the event it predicts. 
2. **Genuine Prophecy:** The prophecy should be specific and structured, including names, places, and events. 
3. **Independent Fulfillment:** The fulfillment of the prophecy should not be influenced by the prophet or their followers. This avoids self-fulfilling prophecies.

*Category:  Quranic Prophecy*

While the Quran was compiled after this prophecy, the historical context and other evidence support the claim that the prophecy was genuine.

##  Is there any evidence that the Quran was initially revealed in written form?

**Category:** Quranic Revelation

The speaker states that the Quran is a written revelation, citing several narrations that support this claim. He points to the first revelation where the Angel Gabriel showed the Prophet Muhammad a parchment or scroll with writing on it and asked him to read, but he replied that he could not read.  The speaker also argues that the Quran's wording, particularly the phrase "in a protected tablet," further suggests a written form. He believes the evidence for a written revelation is clear and unambiguous. 

## Why was the Quran written without any dots on the letters?

**Category:** Quranic Script

The speaker discusses the absence of dots on the letters in early Quranic manuscripts and the debate surrounding it. He refutes the claim that the Arabic language did not have dots at the time, presenting two pieces of evidence: a rock inscription praising Umar ibn al-Khattab that clearly includes dots on the letters, and a document written in Arabic with dots that was found in Egypt. He concludes that the Arabic language did have dots, and the absence of them in early manuscripts is a deliberate choice, possibly for the following reasons:

- **To allow for multiple readings:**  The speaker argues that the absence of dots allows for different readings, especially in cases where words could have multiple meanings. He believes this allows for a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of the Quran's message. 
- **To emphasize the miraculous nature of the Quran:** The speaker suggests that the omission of dots is a testament to the Quran's divine nature, implying a divinely intended ambiguity that allows for various interpretations while remaining consistent with the meaning. 

## What is the significance of the first person who dotted the Quran? 

**Category:** Quranic Script

The speaker touches upon the debate surrounding the first person to dot the Quran and the significance of the practice. He theorizes that the dotting system might have been adopted from Hebrew, which uses dots for the short vowels that Arabic lacks.  He suggests that the dotting may have been introduced by a Jewish scholar who converted to Islam, possibly to aid in the correct pronunciation of the Quran for those who were not fluent in Arabic. 

He also discusses a possible later adoption of the dotting system, possibly during the time of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, with the purpose of clarifying the text and avoiding confusion with other Arabic letters that share the same shape but have different meanings. He states that this adoption was likely influenced by the Hebrew system and was a natural progression for a language closely related to Arabic.

## What is the proper way to count the Quranic verses, particularly with regard to the Basmala? 

**Category:** Quranic Counting

The speaker emphasizes the need for a consistent system for counting Quranic verses, particularly regarding the Basmala (the opening phrase "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"). He argues that the Basmala should be considered a separate verse, despite being a recurring phrase, because it's considered part of the Quran as a whole.

He states that the correct count for the Quran should be 114 chapters and 6236 verses, with the Basmala being considered the zeroth verse of each chapter. He rejects other counting systems that include the Basmala as part of the verse count of each chapter, stating that this leads to inconsistencies and misinterpretations. 

## What are the seven readings of the Quran, and how do they affect our understanding of the text?

**Category:** Quranic Readings

The speaker touches upon the seven readings of the Quran, stating that they are primarily related to differences in pronunciation and recitation styles, rather than significant changes in meaning.  He suggests that these variations are permissible and don't constitute separate Quranic texts, but rather different ways of reciting the same text. 

He mentions that these readings are often attributed to seven specific Imams, who received their knowledge from various sources. However, the speaker raises doubts about the consistency and reliability of their methodologies, arguing that a more in-depth study is necessary to determine the accuracy and validity of these readings. 

## What should we do about the claims of Imran Hussein regarding Islamic Eschatology?

**Category:** Eschatology

The speaker expresses concern about Imran Hussein's claims about Islamic Eschatology, stating that he hasn't found any reliable source material to support Hussein's statements. He believes that any criticism of Hussein's claims should be based on thorough research and a clear understanding of his arguments. 

The speaker suggests that if Hussein's statements are being presented as entertainment, it's important to distinguish them from serious theological discussions. He suggests that viewers should carefully scrutinize Hussein's claims and rely on verified sources before drawing conclusions.

If there were two entities, one would have to have a feature that the other lacks. This would create a deficiency in the entity without the feature, meaning that its existence depends on the other. Since both entities are necessary, their existence cannot be contingent.  

##  If there is only one entity, how can we perceive multiple things?

## 127.34s:  Gospel 
**Question:**  How come this more important event, which should be a celebrating moment, is not in the current gospels in our hands? 
**Answer:** The speaker proposes that the event in question is not in the current gospels because there were many gospels in circulation during the 4th Century.

## 143.94s: Problem 
**Question:** This is called a so-called problem, but I would say the best resolution is to say that evidently in the current gospels, even the four books which are selected to be the best available at that time, there are many others going on in people's hands. 
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the absence of a specific event from the current gospels is not a real problem, because many gospels were available during that time. The speaker also points out that even the current gospels contain fabricated stories, like the Christmas Story, suggesting that some information may have been deliberately omitted. 

## 242.22s: Fabrication 
**Question:** There are also fabrications in Matthew. For example, after the crucifixion there was a massive earthquake, the grave split, and hundreds of people came out of the graves, and walked in Jerusalem.  Why is this not mentioned in any other gospels? 
**Answer:**  The speaker cites Matthew's account of a post-crucifixion earthquake and resurrection of the dead as a clear fabrication.  The speaker emphasizes that this event is not mentioned in any other gospels, nor is it recorded in any other historical records.

## 408.539s:  Samuel

## 495.24s: Isa 
**Question:** When Allah says to Isa, "I will purify you from the disbelievers so they will not be able to put their hand on you and they will leave you to me," does this mean that Isa was lifted up to heaven immediately before he was apprehended?

## 5875.86s:  Earth 
**Question:** Why is the Surah mentioned Earth and Sky despite the Earth being a small part of the sky?

## 1676.539s: Consort
**Question:** Is Mary, the mother of Jesus, the consort of Allah? 
**Answer:** The speaker addresses the claim that Mary is the consort of Allah.  This idea is rooted in a dualistic theory of good and evil, which was common in Babylonian mythology, where the gods were seen as having a consort who gave birth to both good and evil. 

## 1742.82s: Mother
**Question:** Is Mary, the mother of Jesus, the mother of god?
**Answer:** The speaker explains that calling Mary the mother of god comes from a misunderstanding of the concept of divinity.  Some people see divinity as a genus or species, and believe that Jesus, as a divine being, passed on his divinity to Mary, making her a divine being as well.

**Question:** Is divinity a genus or a type?

**Question:** Why do people call Mary a mother goddess or the mother of God?

## 2004.659s: Mother of God 
**Question:** Is calling Mary the mother of god the same as appointing her as a divine being? 
**Answer:** The speaker explains that calling Mary the mother of god is essentially the same as appointing her as a divine being. The speaker argues that this is a common misconception and that the idea of Mary as a divine being is not supported by the Quran.  

## 2062.2s: Known 
**Question:** If Jesus had said that he was divine or that his mother was divine, wouldn't we know it?
**Answer:**  The speaker explains that if Jesus had made these claims, there would be witnesses and evidence to support them.  This is the basis for the Quranic challenge to prove that Jesus made such claims.  

## 2105.52s: Title
**Question:** The Gospel of Mark is titled, "The Gospel of Jesus Christ, Son of God."  Does this mean that Jesus himself claimed divinity?
**Answer:**  The speaker explains that the title of the Gospel of Mark is the publisher's choice and does not reflect the content of the book itself. The speaker further argues that the content of the book itself does not provide strong evidence that Jesus claimed divinity.  

## 2409.18s: Submission
**Question:** Is the verse in question a submission to Christians?

## 2438.099s: Purpose

## What are the various entries to the issue of trinity?

Although not a major event today, the document was considered a genuine expression of trinitarian faith in the following centuries.

## What is the fundamental fallacy in discussing the Godhead?
**Category:** Philosophy

The speaker believes that the fundamental fallacy in discussing the Godhead is assuming it's a monotheistic theory, studying it in the sense of Old Testament scriptures and philosophical development. This approach relies on simple language, but when discussing a divine being that exists necessarily, it requires a more sophisticated philosophical approach, distinguishing between contingent and necessarily existing beings.

## What is the problem with the concept of Godhead?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker argues that there is no category called Godhead. The divine being is a singular, necessarily existing entity. The concept of Godhead as a classification, similar to "animalhood" or "humanity," is a fallacy. This is because the divine being is unique, not a genus or species that can be categorized.

## What is the issue with the statement "He himself is the father of his own essence"?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker finds the statement "He himself is the father of his own essence" problematic. It implies the divine being begot itself, which is nonsensical. The speaker suggests a more accurate statement would be that the divine being exists by necessity, avoiding the concept of self-begetting.

## What is the problem with the mirror model of the Trinity?
**Category:** Philosophy

The speaker criticizes the mirror model of the Trinity, which suggests the divine being looks at itself, sees its image as the Son, and the relationship between them as the Holy Spirit. The speaker points out that this model relies on the idea of external reflection, whereas the divine being exists eternally and is not subject to external influences. Additionally, this model leads to an infinite regress of reflections, which contradicts the idea of a singular, necessarily existing being.

## What are some other attempts to explain the Trinity? 
**Category:** Theology

The speaker lists various attempts to explain the Trinity, including:

* **The Modalist Approach:** This approach suggests that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different aspects or modes of the same being. This leads to issues with the concept of separate personalities, as well as the concept of sacrifice and salvation.
* **The Soul Analogy:** This analogy compares the Trinity to the relationship between a soul, its knowledge, and its love. However, the speaker points out that the mind is not separate from the being, and attributes are not separate entities.
* **The Cube Analogy:** This analogy compares the Trinity to the six sides of a cube, which are distinct yet part of the same whole. However, this analogy fails because the sides of a cube are not themselves cubes, and they can be separated.

## What is the key to understanding the Trinity?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker suggests that the key to understanding the Trinity is to approach it historically, starting with the origins of the concept and its development. He emphasizes that the scriptures themselves do not clearly define the Trinity in the way it is understood today. 

## What is the proper approach to studying the Trinity?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker suggests a two-pronged approach to studying the Trinity:

1. **Historical Context:** Analyze the historical development of the concept, including its roots in Greek philosophy and its evolution within Christianity.
2. **Scriptural Scrutiny:** Examine the scriptures critically, identifying inconsistencies and potential fabrications, while recognizing that the scriptures cannot be considered infallible.

## What are some examples of historical fabrications in the scriptures?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker points to several examples of historical fabrications in the scriptures, such as:

* **The story of the three persons visiting Abraham:** The speaker argues that this story should not be interpreted as evidence for the Trinity, as the Old Testament contains numerous instances of Yahweh appearing in various forms.
* **The story of the circumcision of Isaac:** The speaker argues that this story is likely fabricated to emphasize the importance of circumcision and that the idea of Yahweh coming to kill Isaac is nonsensical.
* **The attribution of the five books of Moses to Moses himself:** The speaker points out that these books contain descriptions of Moses's death, which is impossible for him to have written.

## Why should we not blindly accept the scriptures as infallible?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker argues that blindly accepting the scriptures as infallible is intellectually irresponsible. The scriptures should be subjected to critical scrutiny, cross-referencing, and historical analysis to identify inconsistencies and potential fabrications.

## What is the role of philosophy in understanding the divine? 
**Category:** Philosophy

The speaker emphasizes the importance of philosophical discourse in understanding the divine. He highlights the contributions of Islamic scholars, particularly those in the Shia tradition, who advanced philosophical concepts like contingency and the necessarily existing being. He criticizes Western scholarship for neglecting these developments, which could have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the divine.

## What is the problem with the idea of "created" when it comes to the Quran?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker addresses the confusion surrounding the idea of the Quran being "created." He clarifies that the Quran is not the divine knowledge itself, but rather a revelation of that knowledge. He argues that the notion of a "created" Quran is based on a misunderstanding of space, time, and divine will.

## What are the key takeaways from the discussion?
**Category:** Summary

The discussion highlights the following key takeaways:

* **The concept of Godhead is a fallacy:** There is only one, necessarily existing divine entity, not a category or genus.
* **The Trinity is a problematic concept:** The various attempts to explain the Trinity, including the mirror model and the modalist approach, are ultimately flawed and lead to contradictions.
* **The scriptures should be studied critically:** We should not blindly accept the scriptures as infallible. They require scrutiny, cross-referencing, and historical analysis.
* **Philosophy plays a vital role in understanding the divine:**  Philosophical discourse, particularly in the Islamic tradition, provides valuable insights into the nature of the divine. 
* **The proper approach to studying the Trinity is historical:** By understanding its historical development and its roots in Greek philosophy, we can better appreciate its limitations and its implications.

**Category:** Geopolitics

135.0s : that's relate to that what I'm going to say now to conclude before concluding all the recent leaks uh is is preparing this Israel has 50 15 exceptional Rockets who shoot behind the horiz Horizon called golden horizon has 50 they can be shot from airlanes have 50 have three tankers or tank tanker airlanes and they are training for attacks Etc back and forth this could be true or could be just plff and or other they will attack the nuclear no they will not attack they may attack the headquarters of the IRG no maybe they will attack the president maybe they will attack Kam himself which is becoming now stronger after the issue with the attack against Netanyahu maybe this not maybe the the oil field maybe not the oil field all of this back and forth and the White House sometime confirming sometime denying some they asking is to R so I say we cannot control them I think all of that is designed to create considerable amount of confusion especially since Israel America have recognized that the current leadership this new m soal m pres president of of um of Iran uh this man has proven to be really uh politically a dumb a dumb person definitely he doesn't know how to express himself properly and uh and all his expression show weakness and will and and encourage the Israelis to push him further and further and further now my conclusion the following one of two either all of this all these Leakes and so on true or not true are designed to keep Iran in suspense terrify them that they can do no more action so that is can take its time and work with demolishing on the sh in Lebanon smashing their Villages essentially committing a genocide besid obviously killing as many aspects of the fighter in the South they may not a victory but if they could cause considerable harm so that hisbah is weakened and his base in Lebanon is is decimated that will be a relative success for them push him even with high blood cost for for them to behind the Lani and get the settlers back in the RO that's the intention while Iran is just Frozen like uh like the snake which is being played by the snake Master being being terrified and sing he sings and and and and uses drums and so on and the snake is Dancing with him because it's just being controlled by the movement because the the snake Master is having more intelligence than the snake and and as a matter of fact the snake is more deadly than the sake Master but it cannot exercise it deadliness because it doesn't have the mental capacity to recognize that it has certain strength which can be exercised it seems to be just like that Iran and the option it that mean that's all that is just a bluff just to delay and to prevent Iran from stepping in until they can finish their business with with Gaza and so on that's one the other option is really they are planning for a strike which will be most likely very painful whatever the case may be if I were in place of the Iran lead leadership if I were I'm not saying this an advice for them because I know that they will not listen to advice if in their place I will take the initiative and strike fast take a preemptive strike which is back breaking but not decapitating meaning all airport all military airports will be smashed that's five of them the power station which need only a small small number of rockets three four Hypersonic and maybe 105 uh ballistic Hypersonic ballistics which can be maybe intercepted but the Hypersonic the low flying hypersonics are difficult to intercept these this number is enough for every Power Station if you hit the center of the power station and the cury now is sufficient for that you can't they they will be demolished the five power station and they have two they have two only uh refiners these will be taken out and also some strategic and political targets like for example the the Prime Minister office the ministry of Defense uh the mosad uh unit 8,200 uh Camp uh the various major Radars for these T system and uh uh yeah and things like that and the the KET the house of Netanyahu and his office and so on that would be pushing Israel to the border of nuclear escalation then they have to make a decision either they go nuclear which would end of their Annihilation most likely this will not happen the probability of that is extremely low or they will give up and agree on ceasefire and stopping the fight and then they can LIF to their own design to collapse and disintegrate internally that what I would do if Iran does that this will be miraculous and it will save them from the strike because the strike is coming inevitably even if it delayed several months Israel will be preparing more having more facilities more s systems more new raders uh uh the gulf countries will be encouraged seeing Iran is is is afraid and and intimidated they will cooperate more with Israel uh the bases in the Gulf will will rearrange themselves to to to be more punful against Iran and the next attack will be as devastating as the one allegedly planed that maybe twice or three times so will they do that allaham we don't know I hope they will wake up to the reality and take a preemptive strike and there's not very much time remaining because if a strike is really planned and will be done if it's not just a bluff it will be toward the end of October so that they can declare Victory show pictures videos uh brag around and affect American elections and any backlash or any problems for them they can cover it up at least until the election day after that there's no problem if the election is over then they will be able to spin and manage things as as needed as the result of the election so I think that's the way to go but will they go this way hopefully maybe some miracle Could Happen although I'm doubting for that I'm doubting that very strongly so let's wait and see by next week maybe things will be more clearer we'll be there until next weekend um at that maybe it is the 27th still few days ahead still almost a week ahead of the American election that's maybe a little bit too far maybe they will do it like the 29th 30th of October but it could be by the 27 we'll meet next week insh we'll see what happens

The speaker believes that the current situation is highly volatile and that there are two possible scenarios. First, Israel is deliberately creating confusion and fear to weaken Iran and prevent them from taking action. Second, Israel is preparing for a devastating preemptive strike against Iran. He suggests that Iran is not a match for Israel militarily, but that they should take a preemptive strike before they are further weakened. The speaker is skeptical of Iran's ability to take decisive action but hopes that they will do so before it's too late.

##  0:52.5  | Session|  Today is session 112, we are on Aya 112 of Surat Al-Maida. 

## 1:32.78 | Recitation| I wonder did we do that last time, because I added the eye after that.  

## 2:01.18 | Interpretation| Believers you are responsible for your own souls. Those who go astray cannot harm you if you are on the right path. All of you will return to God, and he will tell you what you used to do.  

## 2:53.58 | Interpretation| Focus on yourselves, it doesn't harm you. Yeah, maybe I did not do that. It doesn't harm you, uh, whoever got astray if you are guided. So focus on getting self-guided, getting yourself from the right path. The your return would be to Allah, and he will inform all of you about that, what you have been doing. Yeah, that's it. 

## 2:58.959 | Interpretation| The meaning is very clear. There was some, some uh, issue relating to understanding.  

## 3:12.419 | Narrative| There's a narrative about some issue that happened by the ashari, if they have the, the tribe of ashari who came up with the Giant from Abussini was coming back from Abyssinian and arrived at Medina when the prophet was in high bar, and then he proceeded to harbor together with one of them and his brothers and so on. And one of these Ashari there was some issue in their tribe, not in this in the battle Campbell of hybrid maybe, but after that. 

## 3:33.6 | Narrative| He did not do the necessary intervention or something like that. A messenger, why didn't you change the prophet, evil, or he obviously has the capability and the necessary authority. 

## 3:47.3 | Narrative| The prophet answered, "Because I listened to what Allah said, focus on yourself, you'll not be Mr will you will, you will not be accounted for that, it will not harm you for those who got us three, uh, because he said why did you get this interpretation? It is the meaning of that, it is the, the, those who got astray from the kofar, they will not harm you. Their costume, not harm you. That's it. Not that it doesn't apply to any believer. 

## 3:59.639 | Narrative| And also if you look at the wedding of the Ayah, you see how, how people come sometimes misunderstood. So this is it doesn't have, you all got to go astray when you are guided. That's not who commits sin and you are not crazy and you are not doing it. No, this is, and usually when going astray or a guidance is, not about believer doing mistakes which others should command and enjoying them to change and etc. So this is the only collection, there's still understanding. 

## 4:20.18 | Interpretation| So this is, it will not harm you with a disbeliever that I believe I want to stay. If they are guided and you fall to the right path, so don't worry about that. Focus on that. It does not mean, for example, even for this video, but that you don't call them to Islam. That doesn't debate with them in good times to get them back from some of the misguidance. No, it doesn't mean that, but that you should not be concerned about that in the sense that you grieve or think you are responsible. No, they are responsive of their own acts and so on, but you are still have the enjoyment of calling them to Islam, to God, to wear that, give them good admonishment and good advice etc. etc.  

## 4:57.38 | Interpretation| So that's I think that we did not touch this last time. So, so I want to just assess that point that is does not have anything to do with the command good and forbidden evil or or does not have any, uh, any restricting meaning to the Surah that all humans are lost except for enjoying, and enjoy it to each other or admonish each other for hack and for Sabbath is right and to be persistent and perseverance in sticking to the truth.  

## 4:92.18 | Interpretation| Because usually sticking to the truth is usually painful and Peter. This, this is different than this one. Here it is, those who go astray by their own will, willful doing, will not harm you. But if you fail to, to do your detail of calling to Islam and so on, when it is possible, or for the entire inside the believer we have the obligation of commanding good at video, forbidding evil which is in the injunction of the Quran, Sunnah in many places, then that will harm you because you've helped your duty. So nobody should misunderstand that like this. 

## 5:31.3 | Narrative| Even companion could fall in such a misinterpretation because they have not really absorbed the meaning or did not get enough education over the prophet because they are late in companionship. But even all this companion could make mistakes.  

## 5:49.3 | Narrative| Some people sometimes have said the companions say that they think it's a lecture the moment someone become a companion, somehow you grow wings and become like an angel. This misconception we almost clean from our head, and it will come down in Shabba and in the next Ayah, so that's the meaning of this area. 

## 5:61.72 | Interpretation| That's the comet otherwise it's clear so don't be, uh, don't think that, that you will be harmed by those going in Michigan going to miscarriage by the old design. We are not harmful for you as long as your own duty and you are getting back guided part of being guided is that you carry the dawa when it is appropriate. Obviously, is not an obligation, except for those who who have sufficient knowledge and have in certain position of dawah, but cutting down the other remote inside the Muslim Community is an obligation especially against the rulers and with the rules that's fundamentalist part of the description of the Believers which we I think came to Surah when you said the main characteristic of the Believers as a community, both male and female, that they come out good and very evil and believe in Allah as messenger and performs Allah etc. They say the commander good, they are alive, they support each other, they come out good and forbid even, even a head even believing in Allah we know we realize the base, but this is for such importance in that context that it's mentioned even ahead also more important eyes. 

## 6:31.86 | Interpretation| So that's the, that's what this ISO do not be, I think that these who are one, that's three, will harm you as long as you are guided or part of being guided is to do your duties, whatever it is, and do as much as possible from these reality things, if you're capable and if you you have a facility for that like, for example, if you are a qualified man, who for example, has a long arm and long information about, for example, the various we will come to that, it is maybe today or next time what the various publication and mistakes in the scripture description to inform that people have that and call them to islamans, correction for those mistakes in the description and so on.  

## 6:74.04 | Interpretation| But that's obviously what becomes an obligation for if there is nobody else doing it, and secondly, if you are really well established in that, but otherwise you don't follow up with this believer of going with the misguidance and uh, but inside the Islamic Camp there you have no Liberty references of this evidence, especially from the rulers. You have to change it if if necessary. If it is the level of coverage by false, if not capable, then by word. If not capable, then at least in the heart you have to condemn it and reject it and train yourself to, by word or by the sword, if necessary. 

## 7:09.86 | Interpretation| So that nobody should confuse that this is a liberty or exclusion from commanding God of everything inside the Muslim Community. 

## 7:23.959 | Interpretation| So concluding, all of you will be sent to Allah and he will inform everyone what he's doing. So get focused on yourself that you're even guided because you will be questioned about all your Deeds, so they don't divert your attention well for that which is not your job. Do your job and your job is to be guided. 

## 7:47.019 | Interpretation| Corrupt or they deviate, they are capable usually to be corrupt and male and destroy the whole society much faster than any single person. But that is another, another issue, which we call it Indulgence and put detail we have a complete book about that inshallah, will have second edition coming soon and also translated.  

## 8:09.279 | Interpretation| Oh ye you believe, let there be Witnesses between you when Death groweth knife. This is ridiculous. This is like 15th century or something to get pixels. They should have, there's a Modern English version of it. I don't know why it is.  

## 8:30.54 | Interpretation| The best of English test is that polypical. Well, this is yeah, from 1500s. This is, this is a oh ye who believe. This is just the best one is Kafka, so they cut through the unnecessary uh, so this one's good. I mean, Believers, when Death approaches you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses to the writing of your will. If death approaches you while you are traveling far from home, let two just men from among other from among another people act as Witnesses. Take hold of the two men after having prayed and if you have any doubts in your mind, let each of them pray to God, we will not sell our word for any price even if it were for the sake of a mere relative. We will not hide God's testimony or else we will be counted among the sinful. Okay, so the first collection is that they said two just men, no, it is honesty and truthfulness, these two. It is used also for the feminine and general injunctions, so so it could be men and women. So that's, that's bad, but this one is stuck in his mentality that woman cannot be Witnesses or on his restricted way, which is his fallacy and you remember, we discussed at the end of this fallacy is still stuck in many brains.  

## 9:12.18 | Interpretation| That's number one. So are the two of Justice? What are these two, female, female, uh, male, female, uh, whatever. Neutral, if they success doesn't exist, obviously, despite all these LGBT etc. nonsense. But if it is done, that was that they just, and they are people of justice and honesty and the Integrity, so that their witnesses can be, uh, can be relied upon. 

## 9:38.279 | Interpretation| Principle from you, what does he say from you? Some translate from your own people, without meaning God's Own people. They are trying to run away because there were two points of view since ancient times. What is from you, meaning the correct point of view. Establish stressed and brought to so many narratives from webinar bus, and many other companions. Majority, not all, but the majority of Companions. And is it from your meaning from the believing was, from the from the belief of the Muslims? 

## 9:65.12 | Interpretation| And or two others from from the others too. To just people also which you perceive to be just again it doesn't say just, want to say two others from that, from from outside not from you, and the correct point of view it is from non-believers people outside Islam and you'll find many others saying from the people of the book, but this is restricting something which Allah did not restricted. Allah could have said from the word, no, that's not that's putting in Allah's mouth what he did not say. That's wrong. It's from any outside the correct point of view from those from you. 

## 10:01.279 | Interpretation| Do just one could be men could be a man and woman etc. in in control distinction and rejection of the misconception which has been digging itself deep in Islamic history and Islamic scholarship and from the others will be outside the Muslim faith, from other faith and other beliefs. 

## 10:22.579 | Interpretation| And this is specifically the, but it is not a condition. 

## 10:30.16 | Interpretation| Are going back and forth on Earth, meaning you are not at home. That's how it usually happens, but there's not been this is necessary condition for this, for this situation. 

## 10:42.52 | Interpretation| Some people say this is a condition that if you have, uh, from from the other Faith only is it, it's as conditional on that, but definitely this is not persuasive. 

## 10:53.059 | Interpretation| That's it, it is being being on on travel and so on, the story, which is the revision came to is about travel. I will mention the story soon but that, that should be not regarded as persuasive and comparing. But this is normally where it happens because you're in your home, unsettled and then and you feel that approaching then there will be relatives nearby, there'll be, there'll be but there'll be enough Witnesses and relatives, and even lawyers and so on available to do that.  

## 10:81.62 | Interpretation| There is no need to go into this complex regulation. So this will be mostly and almost exclusively happening only if you are not at home, you are going to travel and we mentioned that when we mention the story become clear what means, and then you are suddenly feeling this approach, getting falling sick, getting an infection, getting a deadly injury, and then we have you have to manage that, and these, these two have to be, uh, forced to stand after prayer. 

## 11:12.84 | Interpretation| So that they make an oath by Allah, but only inner septum if you have a doubt about their witness. If there's no doubt, there's no reason for that, then only today, that you receive the testimony, what they have they're delivering. I will mention exactly what that was exactly I mean, we're delivering, and then everything looks correct. There's nothing which missing there, whichever any hinting, does it then there is no need to get them to make an oath after the prayer. Whose prayer of also we'll get to that also that because you have doubt, and they make an oath that we make about Allah that we are not going, uh, for for any motivation even if it's beneficial for one of our next option, and we are not going to hide anything for the witness of Allah otherwise we are definitely sinful and unjust.  

## 11:69.88 | Interpretation| So it seems to be that mentioning looks like how to apply that for people who are not a Believer but that is because because the the people do not follow the the the the straight in the Stream of the of the evidence of the ayas because it says you could say it is it has two two different statements that have merged together with an or in between. If you ask them on traveling away and so on, and then this surprises you, then get to Witnesses of of Justice from you from the believer. 

## 12:08.64 | Interpretation| But if, when they come to deliver the the the Wasilla, the will or the, what they, what the dying person has with him to commence money etc., the story will clarify with what we may have and they deliver it and everything seems to be in order. There's no need to doubt anything. There's no need for them, let usually them to stand, get them to the court, and ask him to after Salah, that's for the believer, obviously, as we're talking about Muslim, and then, uh, they make an author, a very heavily author, like that without also the heaviness of the author is also indicated by the should do it because the tool do heavy Oaths and very binding us after starting thus far in the case two just from us to to, uh, two from other from other people. 

## 12:63.539 | Interpretation| Manhattan, and then we have a reason for doubt, not just because they're from other people, but there is maybe they deliver things perfectly, there's nothing to be the doubt about just physically fine, no problem. But if there's any reason of Doubt, then you can apply to the court. It must be done by the authority, and they have to do something equivalent to swearing after certain hustle now the Believers. 

## 12:83.34 | Interpretation| The disabiliters may not have such also. They may not respect it also, what also means for us doesn't mean anything in that case. They have to integrate it after such such a ritual of them which is very heavy and binding. Whatever the ritual may be, for example, let me give the extreme case of an atheist, says I don't play, I don't believe in does God exist, but I can make an oath under the penalty of bursary and on my honor that is the truth, nothing that the truth and the completed I delivered completely what have been given to me from the dying person, so and so on and I assigned to the effect in front of the court and on a pronounce it publicly or dictate to someone if he's illiterate and put my seal or my thumb on it, that will be the equivalent of salt Russell for a Christian. It may be taking the Cross and putting it on the Bible if it has on top of it. For a Jew, there is no cross, but he can put his hand on the, on the Old Testament. Whatever it is which is equivalent and uh, so it's from foreign. 

## 13:60.64 | Interpretation| From another Faith just inserted between under the rest applies to them appropriately foreign. 

## 13:88.84 | Interpretation| This is only for the believing one. For them is highly, uh, highly, highly respectable, and they and they have to attend us Allah with the community and with the judge and then after Salah, they are brought to the court of law or the judges are sitting in the Masjid, and they do the oath, the heavy oath con fortified by being after for the non-believer clearly doesn't make any sense to get them in Salah and all have the fortification of solar generally, so so for so so what what's the meaning such a ritual of their side which is as binding according to their faith, and they gave the extreme example over atheists even, so I think it should be read like that because that's that's how how Quran should be, that at most generality which does not but across the borders of rationality and linguistic limitation and they might make an oath by Allah in the case of this believer, maybe you cannot buy their owner or make sure I make an author without mentioning Allah, otherwise but under the penalty of perjury that I have truthful that I'm telling the whole truth, I'm not hiding anything. The usual ones you people put it affidavit in Britain which is don't necessarily do actually, the the English law does not specify that you make an oath by Allah or by God or anyone just by make an oath other penalty of perjury so on, so and so on. 

## 14:75.28 | Interpretation| Uh under whatever your regardless as a name for this foreign. 

## 14:97.26 | Interpretation| Let me give an example for that. You may have you may be in trouble in a business every time past business travel, so people under some uh people who are not believer with you, but they are remotely related, or they from the same tribe, and they have maybe in low relation with the with the with some of the hairs and then they hide some of the things or some of the instructions written instructions of the dying person. Because this way, their in-laws will benefit more from that, that will be British of thrusters will be a higher fabrication. Let me just mention so before going through an abstract things, mention what the story which we have uh was supposedly the reason of Revelation obviously the national or not all nicely synchronized with each other, but the corner of story seems to be well established.  

## 15:49.26 | Interpretation| The story is the following, admitted to you. Yeah. Yeah, so don't make any mistakes. 

## 15:57.419 | Interpretation| So this story the main story is narrated from Tabari gives his snad also have maybe question here and there, um, no, this one is good. That's from the outside of his son, Abdul America from his father, a man from balisam, uh, that's uh, that his name is Mission. Another narration, uh, who is by genealogy but by Alliance he was a freed slave, but one of the went out that time was Christian, and he was a Christian until late. He's famous with the Hadith of Justice, if anyone is interested. And his cousin or next, both of them are Christian by Alliance, uh, face death, and then he and then he entrusted them with what he has with him. They were going for business, they, they were, they were usually going between Medina and Sham and yeah, and Mecca before even immigration. So then that is for a long time and he was most likely doing a lot of business with some before they immigrated and when they went to the Medina, if immigration because Moses customer and the business partner where the one who arrest Islam and went to Medina, his community was between sham and Madina more frequently than Mecca, but maybe other business partners too. We don't know, but that's what and his cousin or his brother was with him back and forth, and one day she said his brother maybe his brother for a mother only because not the son of bada, but anyway I can shake it, that's his trivial points interesting for us, both our business part and going back and forth. 

## 16:70.039 | Interpretation| So he gave them what he has with him because they were going for business, he has obviously goods and so on, and the, the most valuable things he had is a pot out of silver with with gold ornamentation highly valuable heavy and highly valuable obviously going to Sham where obviously they have the Roman Empire and we have three that coming going to the Persian Empire. This is something uh high-class people and Kings as I usually buy so he was hoping to get some good money for that of considerable money because of this gold ornamentation like like palm tree leaves and so on. 

## 17:07.84 | Interpretation| And on, clearly you cannot use it in Medina, because using gold and silver poses Haram in Islam, so whatever it is and other things. 

## 17:16.299 | Interpretation| So he trusted them with that, put the things in, in suitcases and luggages. One narration claimed that he wrote exactly what is there and hit it somewhere in like a small pocket and so on in the Box, just because it's a precaution. Uh, another nation there's nothing to that and say about the people back home before he went have a good record what he has. Either way, it seemed to me I don't exclude either, I don't exclude either. I, I would say such a seasoned business whom they trust to travel and so on, will be with the god we take us enough to keep this exact recording of things. So he will, death is approaching, he is not going to survive, so he wrote this documentary obviously he's killed their writing and so on, so it's quite polished and educated this person. I'll get his name shell from the next narration, and hit it in that, and the, um, evidence or commitment because Christian usually the committed Christians are honest and and they don't take Liberties. The Jews, they may have some people say even if they are practicing, they say ah we can we can take home. We remember we discussed that issue and how Allah condemned that area in the Quran, but Christians are not known for that generally. They are not known for that, but anyway, this man seems to be not as that good practice. Is more of a businessman with a bit of loose morality, so I said okay, we'll bring that to your family when we back to Medina, and then they could not resist the temptation to open one of the of the bags, or would they know where he have the valuable pot, the gold, the gold ornament, the silver pot and the doctor sold it for their own up counts. I mean, let's close everything when they delivered, they go to the family said well, what's happening? We remember that he has these and these things, or another narration said they should they've checked and they found this hidden like a hidden Pocket. They found this, this the certain documents, what is, what is all in these bags or these suitcases, uh, and his luggage and something is missing. And the, the other nations say then either either by this or by this or by both, it could be very well that make the check the records so it's very reasonable to check records. 

## 18:79.76 | Interpretation| Maybe he was sick for a long time and he decided something to spend on his result responsible also. No, no, no, the gifted, no. So she said, but this item is missing based on that. There was a doubt about this, this handing over of this. So they went to the messenger of Allah said without these people because we have this Reasonable Doubt, at least some doubt that something is missing, and these guys maybe have taken it. It may someone, it may be it was stolen from him, but if he has written a record, that would be but I don't know the story of the thing before this question about it. Anyway, we don't know, so the Messenger will ask him to make an author, and they make an oath, and that's it and the matter was settled.  

## 18:92.779 | Interpretation| Now this narration is very Abridged. Another narration is more expanded. It says and the other thing was was the later on the the pot was found either in sham or in in in in Mecca or a third narration claim that himself after embracing Islam felt guilty and admitted to them. So you're allowed to them that we, we, we, we, we just we broke the trust and we sold that and put the money in our pocket. I took 500 Dirham and uh, whatever how it was detected. The pot was mostly I think the most reasonable stories that was found in Mecca because maybe they proceed to Mecca and thought Mac has far away and hostile to become before the conquest of Makkah to Medina, nobody will, will come to, but somehow some people saw it in Mecca and reported to them, and then they is investigated a little bit and they tell out that the the those who have it in America saying we bought it from them. 

## 19:88.84 | Interpretation| So now, now the plot is clear. So Next Step, they, they went to the messenger of Allah with this now with these facts. No, there's not doubt anymore. These are the factory had been determined that it's sold by away, and that, so their testimony and the oath that have delivered everything they did not take anything. If they have sold it and there's good reason that, uh, what, what we have investigated Mecca is through because the other guys, they have no interest to accuse, to to be, to to telling that we bought it from XYZ, which is not mixed with, oh, yeah, we bought them from these two guys, not from from armor or Zed or from these two.  

## 19:95.899 | Interpretation| So they went for the messenger of Allah and they said, despite of these are clearly the author of that has been shown that this is false oath, these two, but they asked the, the people, do you have a further evidence than just male that it had been found there?  

## 20:40.0 | Interpretation| And they say, "No," say, "Are you winning R2 from you, are willing to make an oath by Allah that our, our, that investigation is more reliable, more trustworthy than the initial claim of of these two guys?" They said, "You are winning." And in one, I said one of them was, so it means the story must be after before the conquest of Mecca, but after immigrated together, because he immigrated in the in the library time, so in that time of living, so it must be after that, or even maybe after the conquest of Mecca. We don't know what's happened anyway, it's relatively late. So let's say, eighth year, ninth seventh year, eighth year, nine year, so it's quite early. Sorry, and then the Quran came down to, uh, to confirm the survive whatever you think. 

## 20:94.32 | Interpretation| I'll keep it on record. The wisdom of that has skipped a record. One of it is that when you previously link that everything is fine and the witnesses have been they made even for the lost witnesses, that you can open a code, because this crazy became final, and everything was as it is, until New Evidence came forward to in on the balance show that these guys have lied. 

## 21:24.96 | Interpretation| Any, any court case which someone lies or there's a collusion or something like that even in the Western, in the, in the UK law and most laws or another fundamental effect in the in the proceeding can be worth it even if it has confined it was fine and people distributed the money and initials were done, everything is gone, it can't be still over 10. So this, this point, nobody from characteristics scholar or Tabari has stressed. So it can be over 10, but in that is not enough, that, that, uh, that, that's proven that we Allied because the real the truth may be something else. We don't know, uh, maybe they have forgotten, maybe we don't know what's exactly. So they have to make to affirm their right by making an oath. They just found out that our result of Investigation we are convinced that our result of Investigation is preferable and stronger than their oath and and this way. 

## 21:79.32 | Interpretation| So they have to do the author in the name of Allah, that same way, and then they will be, then, then the other ones will be, would be found guilty and they are forced to retain what they have resolved and and theft, it doesn't need to be like, like a such a gold item or other merchandise could be, for example, give you an example, a document for example.  

## 22:01.3 | Interpretation| Someone is traveling with other people, and then if his death is coming, and in that trouble, or maybe he married a woman in another city and did not tell his family, but whatever he said, it's not good, not to do that because you see how it can happen, but now he felt guilty that she may be neglected from inheritance or should, should be accused. So realize the documentation to let, let me know that I am married to a lady so and so on, that's her address. So if I, if, if I die, my companion will bring this document with them to you, so that you don't take care, you don't allocate her right in health, for example, and one of these guys is the relative tool to maybe a wife of this one who is dying or to an in-law, and you say ah this will reduce the share of myself my my uh uh that wife the other wife which related to me or reduce the share of other in-laws. Now let me hide it, don't deliver it. 

## 22:57.98 | Interpretation| And later on things come to the daylight, that woman come and bring witnesses there for the marriage and so on and and it's a it is the expose that they have done the obviously the the the the people have to make an author and make sure that our, our our submissions are more reliable and more than these people who have hidden that documents. Well, it can't be a document, usually people not hide the document, which has no monetary value. That's what's human nature is unfortunately human greed what it is everywhere.  

## 22:91.4 | Interpretation| So, so, this is the story clarify what's going on, so it is what really all these great Witnesses etc. in the Ayah is actually meaning Oaths because really they are delivering documents or delivering Goods. So there's just an oath that we delivered everything, and we do not help withheld anything, that we did not take anything for us, or did not hide anything for our own interest, or anyone who is maybe next of kin who may benefit from hiding or absolutely clean, neutral not benefiting or harming anybody by any intention. 

## 23:22.3 | Interpretation| So that's, that's clarify this and also that point of that there's such a final ruling can be, uh, can be, uh, can be, uh, uh, or a case can be opened and then the previous ruling can be declared null and void is, is clearly, that's one of the reasons I think the Ayah is enshrining that because it seems to be that I came at the end after all of that was settled, Allah did not interfere in the whole process until it has completed and then that, that I was able to record that and give put the system in place until you almost came unfortunately most, most Focus actually got stuck with with the imaginary conception. The most problem they had is that a witness could be unuslim, and they try to beat around the bush and so on, but already answered them very strongly persuasively, and even hasn't bashed them badly for that, so it is a mockery to claim that's two or two just Witnesses from you, meaning from your own tribe or immoral City, and from the others, Allah. 

## 23:84.0 | Interpretation| From you, meaning from the believing Community, for the believer. And the witnesses from outside you is the one from not from the believer, because the address is to the believer, or you believe, is not the address to the people of Medina or or people of a village or a tribe, and the address of colonies usually to the believer. Ali says clearly said, this is addressed to the people in the in the immigration domain. Like, for example, will come to it that this is that you have no, no Allegiance or or or belonging to those who breastfeed but did not immigrate. So it's clearly addressing the immigrants, though people certain in Medina, the domain of immigration Islam, those who did not immigrate do not have the all the rights and and the aggregation from a text that is addressing those in the immigration domain only.  

## 24:27.02 | Interpretation| They don't have any relation with those until they immigrate except if they ask for help, because they are present religion then help them, all conditions so and so on, so on, will come to that sort of function. It's a very important issue with Allegiance so the address holds to the believer and all the believer, even if they outside the Islamic domain, even if they are living under the ruling of copper by legitimately or even Symphony, this is totally believable to exclude someone. You have to bring at everything exclusion. So this is a mockery that people do sometimes in this. 

## 24:75.839 | Interpretation| So that's it. Now, I actually I mentioned the story, I mentioned there are essentially the content of the next Ayah, so let's read the next Ayah and this translation and then put everything together. Already, already have been put together, so the next I will read, thus in the case, some evidence found later on after the first case was set up and done, that those fellows have lied. Either with certainty or high probability like the case of Tamil with Daddy and Adib.  

## 25:16.16 | Interpretation| Yeah. 

## 25:33.98 | Interpretation| But if after they should come to mind that two witnesses have come become guilty of this very sin, uh, then two others from among those who, those who from the whom the former have deprived of their right shall take their place and swear by God, "Our Testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of what is right or else we may indeed be counted among the evildoers." Next translation, if it is discovered that these two are guilty of this sin, then two of those whose rights have been

## What happened on Tuesday or Wednesday? 
**Category:** Pager Incident

The speaker refers to an incident involving pagers. These were a batch of pagers ordered by a company from a reputable Taiwanese company. The pagers were then licensed to a Hungarian company which, in good faith, produced them. These pagers ended up in Sophia, Bulgaria. The pagers were intercepted and loaded with small explosive charges.

## What was the plan for the pagers?
**Category:** Pager Incident

## What has the reaction been to the attacks?

## What is the political implication of the attack?
**Category:** Political Implications

The speaker highlights the political implications of the attacks, drawing a comparison to a speech by N. last November. They argue that N.'s speech in November was a mistake as it encouraged the escalation of violence.

They also point to the United Nations' recent announcement declaring settlements illegal and ordering Israel to withdraw, seeing this as a missed opportunity for international action. 

## What are the potential options for Israel?
**Category:** Strategic Analysis

The speaker discusses the dilemma faced by N.  He argues that N. is facing the possibility of the U.S. not providing significant military aid if he launches a full-scale invasion of Lebanon.

The speaker believes N. is in a difficult situation and that his actions may lead to a greater international backlash.

## What is the impact of the recent events on the conflict?
**Category:** Strategic Analysis

The speaker describes the current state of the conflict as an escalation of the conflict.

## What is the future of the conflict?
**Category:** Strategic Analysis

The speaker believes that the conflict is unlikely to end soon and that Israel is in a state of implosion. They hope that this implosion will accelerate and that the situation will be resolved within a few years.

## What's the full implication of the Ayah? (The verse) The expansion of versions.
**Category:** Islamic Law

The speaker inquires about the practical implications of an Ayah (a verse from the Quran) concerning the expansion of versions within Islamic law.

## Did anyone sit there and say that you can't reduce from that the necessity of having a constitutional or a supreme court?

**Category:** Islamic Leadership

The speaker observes that there is a lack of engagement with the concept of challenging or questioning the rulings of Islamic leaders within the community. He attributes this lack of engagement to the prevalent tendency towards unquestioning obedience, even in cases of perceived injustice or abuse of power. This obedience, according to the speaker, is rooted in specific Islamic teachings and traditions.

**Category:** Islamic Leadership

**Category:** Islamic Law

## What are the meanings of the hadith where the prophet peace be upon him says that a person who commits zinna or steals or drinks wine is not a believer while doing so? 
**Category:** Islamic Law

The speaker explains that the hadith does not mean that the person is not a believer entirely, but rather that their faith is inactive at the moment of the sin. They are not in a state of conscious awareness of their faith and its principles, which is why they are able to commit the act.

## Isn't the verse "and he made you kings" a grace from Allah that he accepted and warranted the request of Jews to become a kingdom, regardless of the fact that kingship was catastrophic?
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker argues that this verse is not a justification of the Jews' request for kingship. The grace of Allah, according to the speaker, refers to their freedom and autonomy as individuals, rather than granting them a kingdom ruled by a king. The speaker emphasizes that the Jews' decision to request a king was a rejection of the decentralized system of prophetic leadership that Allah had initially given them. 

## How does the command for them to enter these places and take over from these people [Canaanites] who have rejected messengers before, work? 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker explains that the command to enter Canaan is part of a broader principle in the Old Testament, where the only option to clear a land from non-believers is through either surrender, departure, or extermination. However, the speaker clarifies that this principle is not a direct justification for the later actions of the Jews. The Quran, according to the speaker, advocates for a more nuanced approach, where those who wish to remain in the land can become citizens under a more inclusive system. 

## Are you referring to the book of Jeremiah, what are you referring to? 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker is referring to the book of Jeremiah in the Old Testament, which, according to tradition, was saved by Jeremiah in a cave on Mount Nebo across the Jordan River during the Babylonian Exile. The speaker believes that these scriptures, if found, could offer insights into the original, unedited versions of the Old Testament.

## If someone kills someone in a moment of rage for tribal reasons, and he gets killed before his iman is active again, does it benefit him? 
**Category:** Islamic Law

The speaker acknowledges that this is a complex situation. While the person may have been in a state of anger and their iman was inactive, it is difficult to say definitively whether they are condemned to hell. The speaker emphasizes that this scenario should serve as a strong warning against allowing anger and vengeance to override one's faith.

## The question is: Isn't the verse "and he made you kings" a grace from Allah that he accepted and warranted the request of Jews to become a kingdom, regardless of the fact that kingship was catastrophic? 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker reiterates their previous point, emphasizing that the verse does not endorse the Jews' request for a monarchy. The grace of Allah, according to the speaker, refers to their individual autonomy, not the establishment of a central authority. The speaker also highlights that the Jews' choice for a king was a step toward enslavement, contradicting their earlier state of freedom.

## What did the text say about our relationship with rulers and regimes as a whole, as you know average Muslims, what should our interaction be with them, what should our perspective be of our rulers? 
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 176.94s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the Quran only explicitly commands obedience to Allah and the messenger.  This obedience is absolute and unconditional.  All other obedience is conditional and dependent upon the person in question acting according to the commands of Allah.

## Where does this very common narrative we you know we hear constantly from you know multiple groups within Islam of this idea of you know obeying Muslim rulers, even being an unjust rulers, you know you've made it pretty clear that you know that's that's where does it come from?
**Category:** Rulership

**Answer:** The speaker explains that this narrative comes from a misinterpretation of a particular Hadith that is taken out of context and contradicts the Quranic principle of conditional obedience. This Hadith is also weak in terms of its chain of narration. 

## What about this concept of Ijma, consensus on this issue now in, uh, there's other nobody narrates or comments on one of the Hadith narrating a consensus on the idea of, uh, as for rebelling against the rule and fighting him is forbidden by consensus of the Muslims, even if it's sinful and oppressive, and that's based in a shot of Muslim of 1840. Is this one, yes no, that's invalid, this is not always a simple-minded man, he's a good man, no doubt about that, is, the area is a Mystic, more more than really a scholar in in the sense, but nevertheless that they were Rebellion against rulers in, in, against Yazid, against, they have been against, they have been, and against it has been, and all of these have been rebellion, and then although acknowledge that and mention all these Revelations and say but that Ishmael has been concluded after that, that's not terrible against oppressive viewers because it leads to bloodshed.
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 1336.32s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the concept of an Ijma forbidding rebellion against rulers is invalid. He explains that the Sahaba did indeed rebel against unjust rulers, and this Hadith is from a Mystic, not a scholar in the true sense of the word. He argues that the rationale behind forbidding rebellion is that it leads to bloodshed. 

##  Sheikh are you saying that there there was a Hobby like who rebelled themselves so this concept of if they ask if states of evidence of Sahaba who rebelled, doesn't that really get rid of Ishma in the first place because then yeah there's nothing to matter it's nothing anywhere.
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 1604.46s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the historical evidence of the Sahaba rebelling against rulers disproves the idea that such acts are always forbidden.  

##  Sheikh, would you say the the type of, or the the type of Scholars that we have today is a big reason as to why the average, you know, person is so exactly this kind of, this kind of scholarship, this threat, traditional scholarship is the one who should which the, the, the down, down the road, this, this way of decline.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 2283.24s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the type of scholarship prevalent today has contributed to the current decline of the Ummah. He blames scholars for covering up their crimes by creating a narrative of obedience to rulers that contradicts the Quran.  

## So you have to do that, it has to be constructed somewhere, like for example, you are, you have authority in some place, and Technical development that's okay because Muslims are although to cooperate in every way possible, but there's nothing to obey them and the people are not having the right to topple them and get better about that otherwise and, and deny the people the right of accounting them and questioning why is this like this, why is that not a cat.
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 2413.92s
**Answer:** The speaker argues against the idea of unconditional obedience to rulers even for the sake of cooperation. He highlights the right of the people to hold their rulers accountable. 

## And Sheikh, what about what is uh, what should our perspective be of you know Scholars who have openly you know either cited or defended regimes, you know you have maybe like albuti or bin buzz, you know like obviously from different sides of the, of the spectrum, But ultimately defended their, you know their country's regimes, they go they'll go back again to Tahari and justify that and everyone referred to the previous Scholars and claimed that's the consensus, I think they totally justify themselves, should we, should we take from those Scholars is it still valid too, no they're not trustworthy, they are not trustworthy no, neither in their in their Memphis structure not, uh, history shows that they are not trustworthy they never benefited, let me give you various examples in major historic Junction, like for example when the printing press was invented in Europe it was actually within samalkan before that, actually in Europe, scholar community at the time decided most likely to, to keep the control and power of the Muslim masses, they decided to declare that this is this is a bidai etc, there was a, there's an injunction to prohibit using this the printing presses uh, for three centuries, including sometimes even the penalty of death, 300 years back, while Europe in 300 years developed science technology millions of people started reading books and that weakened also the control of the church obviously that's what another shares in Europe the people started reading themselves, you don't need to go to a pretty story for you, you read by yourself, you use your mind, use your brain, they prevented mostly from doing that, yeah, one is much later 300 years later, 300 years. 
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 2492.64s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that scholars who defend regimes are not trustworthy and should not be considered reliable sources of knowledge. He gives the example of scholars prohibiting the use of printing presses in the Muslim world, which ultimately stifled scientific and technological development, while Europe flourished.

## Check, do you think a big Pro, a big part of the problem is that we've we've just honestly become a bit too takleady in the sense that we're not willing to like actually explore the, the evidences and explore the information.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 2632.859s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the Ummah has become too reliant on tradition and not willing to engage with the Quran and Hadith critically. He believes that this is a key part of the problem, leading to a stagnation of intellectual development.  

## So Sheikh, you know this uh, these concepts of you know like not being able to speak on something unless you have any Jazz and stuff is this all that's all Bs, that's nothing what, why should we have each other the book of Allah, his address.

**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 4615.62s
**Answer:** The speaker encourages people to directly engage with the Quran and not rely on the interpretations of scholars who may have their own agendas. 

## Are you saying like your perspective is that the idea of whether a scholar is uh comfortable with a ruler or who like is in hangs around with a ruler or endorses, I, I myself tend to, to, to, to, generally, to, to, uh to have uh negative thought about most of these and this I have a hand direct experience like when Buzz seems to be, have a portion of sincerity but obviously he is limited his scope and his understanding, so many of his positions are because of his limitations, limitation because he is ultimately coming from a school of their hobbies and his knowledgeable about about Quran and uh really bad background and also I think that is deficient, s rely on them, we have to go back to the text exactly, most likely that is, is he studied the classics and these Classics are ahmedi etc etc and all of these are stuck with that with the rubbish with the operators, you have to have really uh a rebellion and intellectual Rebellion to go back to that at the beginning it looks like like a, like a tall order, it's really shocking and people will gasp for air or fear like when we started the campaign I guess when we noticed that there's no way we have to break that, we have to and we did not even started, what, what started is that uh materi established that there is a an agent called acetanzil, the Israel Revelation and he made it until the year 73 hijri and after that the answer of the wheel which is a reinterpretation uh through the favor of rulers, the favor of the people, fever of the rich people and so on.

## So let me take him, the brother, the brother of this one protecting the whole or his father, the beautiful father, although I said look he looks very similar, and then the other of the, of the one I would say no, it's not, it's born in my father's bed, and he's my brother, I'm not going to accept to accuse the, the wife or when or the wife of my father to me to become a committed dinner or stay in my father's memory with such health, oh Islam.

**Answer:** The speaker illustrates the application of Islamic law in the context of lineage and inheritance. He explains the Islamic legal principle that a child belongs to the father if born within wedlock, regardless of any doubts about the father's identity. 

##  Sheikh, a lot of these uh you know strange opinions and and Views and you know like almost dodgy dodgy thoughts as you can say are coming up a lot because a lot of these uh Scholars are using you know different asuli points as secondary and third you know types of assault, why don't more Scholars, principle of General possibility. 
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 5461.199s
**Answer:** The speaker questions why more scholars do not adopt the principle of general permissibility. He implies that many scholars rely on secondary and tertiary sources of Islamic law, rather than directly engaging with the Quran. 

##  Let's have a concrete example, so there is no benefit from it at least to see why what has happened, so you know a lot of things in terms of you know you do have some Scholars say we absolutely have to you know uh adhere and follow by you know rulers and regimes today, you know it's very common common thought uh view that we, we discussed that already, talking about the, the principle of general you're very strong on the principle General permissibility, why do more Scholars not adopt that and adhere to, adhere to that, ask them, ask them.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 5483.1s
**Answer:** The speaker further emphasizes the importance of questioning scholars who advocate for unconditional obedience to rulers. He asks why more scholars do not embrace the principle of general permissibility, which emphasizes the Quranic notion that everything is permissible unless explicitly prohibited.

##  Because they didn't analyze it properly and they don't follow that foreign.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 5531.46s
**Answer:** The speaker attributes the reluctance of scholars to adopt the principle of general permissibility to a lack of proper analysis and adherence to the Quran.  

##  This might be Beyond this topic, but the thing, um, it's a reason, ask him yeah, there's another thing which is quite recent, um, more associated with the with the West, um, and most of them say the minority, um, the idea of navigating differences so basically to put some context to it, a number of notable uh Scholars, uh yasuleleman and all these kind of people they recently published, um, a statement and it was around, sexual identity, gender ethics in Islam and it was kind of, how to tread the line between them, so basically having seeking kind of Common Ground between, um, causes as a minority, and and how to, uh engage with people of different persuasions, you know sexual identities, all that kind of stuff, and kind of coming with a pleasure, but it is there's enough text for that, but this, this is there for example, we know for certainly that we don't, we're not going to endorse any of that stuff, however, in terms of if there's enough text for that, genetics with that, there are, there are, there are certain biological situations, which a baby is born with both organs and things like that, and then now nowadays with the, with the modern science, I know we have the capability of doing the necessary surgical adjustment, we can decide because they even discuss the scholar discuss, at the harm of uh, what is um, now we have scientific solution I, I my suggestion is that this should be treated immediately after birth, it should be, decided which one is really the there will be various genetic issues and so on to that, that can be done with the baby is small and then it doesn't necessarily, this subject so what it is is basically if you look at the quest, you know, this whole idea of arbitrarily deciding, uncertainty no, it's not admitted, no, I'm just discussing it from the root, but so we finish the problem from the road, in that case it should be now we have the facilities to finish the situation, but since the surgical operations and adjusting the diet and and hormones from child, so the child goes goes as a man or woman, that's number one secondly, it should be part of the education that Allah created, a man and woman though or odd cases have been treated, possible treated medically or managed by by law, and the time it was not treated medically, but it is that's clear later on a man are not allowed to behave on the president himself as a woman, this is the major sin, this meaning he's not accepting Allah creation, the same with the woman says, to try to be a woman when you are a man, or try to be a man who you are a woman that's a major sin, this meeting will have a fundamental issue with Creed, you have not been brought up in the correct script I've not been educated that this is how the universe had to decide to test Sports, test man with manhood, this woman with Womanhood, I test both with life, and it's good with evil and evil with good, the fundamental flow there fundamental philosophical flow, that's it period full stop, all this there is nonsense, that imagine in some people who thinks that we're developed from the monkeys just by emergence, there is no God, or the just natural development without any Divine guidance, or any Divine, there's a Divine playground, or in atheism, then atheists will have a problem deciding, or giving it any moral evaluation, you may give it a biological violation, that's nonsensical, if you have all the male organs that you wish to become a woman, why you wish to make a movement, well you have the male organs and so on, I think it's a medical condition even, that even they should conclude on biological grounds that there's a medical condition, maybe there's a problem with the upbringing, I mean there's a sickness in the society, so they try to cure the Sickness by by promoting the sickness and turning it into into a into uh to a normality, that's it, I don't see any anything that Islamic issues clear, yeah I mean there's one thing about it being clear in terms of hook up and half stance, the question is really around how do you engage with these kind of people because if you want I can read it out, it's not what to deal with the people, the people you know, this is how I'm on SO on too, what to do he has no right to go to a clinic and ask to change gender, but it's more around if you're in the in, in the west and you have a common issue, the East what, what to do and how to do with the people so for example you, you're going on a platform and you, you want to, you want you, so for example, you have constitutional rights in the, in the American Constitution, yeah, kind of throw you a lot in with them to kind of get your rights and they get their rights, what's constitutional, what has that to do with the platform, explain more, I can read it to you if you want, no no, meaning you're supposed to uh to allow them in your platform for example, no you are not obliged, in America, these guys they, they, they kind of piggyback off the back of them to get extra to kind of you know like it's almost like lobbying together, uh it should not be, why, why use them, foreign.

**Timestamp:** 5736.96s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the issue of navigating differences in sexual identity and gender ethics within an Islamic context. He clarifies that Islam does not endorse same-sex relationships, but acknowledges that there are biological complexities related to intersex individuals. He suggests that such cases should be treated medically immediately after birth, and that promoting gender fluidity within a Muslim community is a major sin, as it contradicts the Islamic understanding of creation. He also addresses the issue of engaging with LGBTQ+ individuals in Western societies, arguing that while Muslims are not obliged to endorse their lifestyle choices, they should not be subjected to discrimination or violence. 

##  I mean I will, you know, anyway, in our swimming pools we have even men and women say about it anyway so we don't have that issue so anyone who has good is not allowed, it's not acceptable, just because he feels like a woman and declare himself no, if you, if that, if it's true, if you must hear from the West is not in our control, go and remove that male organ, get castrated completely and could be the testicles, you can Flash like a woman, then maybe you will be admitted, it's no problem it's okay, we have to be consistent a symbol, I don't say people made that a big issue, they're trying to transsexual what mean, transsexual you want to change your sex, change it physiologically, fast, really, you're just your feeling, you feel it can't go to hell, we don't care about your feeling, we have also our own feelings, are all restrictions, we just go and remove these organs Catholic yourself completely and say I feel that common, okay I feel orchestrated, that's no problem, then you are not the one who have a sexual desire, and you can mix with them and you can swim with women no problem, is, sexual desire for whatever reason being castrated or whatever it is, organs, that's fine, we don't care about your feeling, some women may feel like a man, but they will never have other penis so they can mix with woman and sit with woman physiologically and physically woman foreign. 
**Category:** Gender Identity
**Timestamp:** 6121.619s
**Answer:** The speaker strongly condemns the idea of transgenderism, arguing that it is a mental disease that should be treated medically, if necessary. He states that people should accept the biological reality of their gender and that feeling like the opposite gender does not justify changing one's physical sex. He also argues that allowing transgender individuals into spaces designed for a specific gender is inappropriate and harmful. 

##  If you insist on that, then remove these organs and so on, I, I don't, I don't see I, I don't see any issue there, other issues are no problem, if someone should I feel a woman and you're just like women are coming in and then we'll say okay, you come with us in the demon session, but be, be aware that I say Allah cursed anyone who had who wishes to be a woman, although he's not a woman, and if it is compulsive, then it may need treatment, who deliberately want to be a woman, someone who's not deliberately is enforced internally, then we say hormonal problems, you need to be studied or maybe bring a psychological problems, maybe he is, he is even not many mentally capable enough to be, to be, uh, to be, uh, to be accountable, and so on, but I don't see what is the issue with platforms and so on, they, these guys especially in America, they got sacked in America, they don't know how to get, they got sucked in there, and they are not unable to get out, that's their problem, they don't know how to deal with the problem on on an obstruction, proper way, this is it all comes out to the same thing in terms of course, they think they think it is, it must be either you are, you kill them or beat them, no it's not true, that's not yeah, even if the message is one of those, that's not me, everything, horses and racing with boys and so on, and then because she was just trying to be like men, and when he healed that, she had that she sees, he never sent anybody who had to punish us, not just people deported them, say you're like yes any woman who want to be like a man, woman, there's only that woman cannot ride horses and then, and but they do but that one more doing it in a way to be a man, if you wanted to, to express itself, that's it, nobody sent there, no punishment, nothing, not even ordering to take the house away, although not to frustrated, this is nothing, but that was very obviously, we have no problems yet, the problem is in people's mind because they do not study the text and they don't go through all of these things thoroughly.
**Category:** Gender Identity
**Timestamp:** 6245.219s
**Answer:** The speaker reiterates his strong opposition to transgenderism, suggesting that those who feel like the opposite gender should undergo physical sex change procedures to align their body with their internal feeling. He dismisses the idea that transgender individuals should be tolerated in Muslim societies or allowed to access spaces designated for a specific gender. 

##  There were audiological cases, they know, we don't have to treat them in and below, and nowadays medicine will help in the treatment and most likely they should be done, it would be prudent to do that from here, before the baby even become conscious, so he grows as a, all these contact cases because either male or other female as much as possible, genetically and and medically with the observation of the parents and so on, and the medical consultation understand, no need to mention that to them, even when they will come out of age and it may need for yourself a various surgeries over several years slowly until everything comes in normal shape on data, how big is that, that's what the university is a spiritual disease, it's a disease of the, the Creed, and your, your vision of your own reality and your place in the universe, but this is not a moment, essentially it goes to metal, the disease that you treat the other believers, juice.

**Timestamp:** 6428.639s
**Answer:** The speaker clarifies his stance on intersex individuals. He suggests that these cases should be treated medically as soon as possible after birth to determine the child's gender based on their biological makeup. He argues that such individuals should be raised according to their biological sex, as the concept of gender fluidity is a spiritual disease that contradicts the Islamic understanding of creation. 

##  Who do not believe in isan may think that is his, um, The Sun Also and so on, maybe, but still does not prevent too much for this purpose, can you, can you, can you seek, can you endorse their rights to have to express themselves. 
**Category:** Freedom of Speech
**Timestamp:** 6508.5s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the issue of freedom of speech and expression, specifically in relation to those who hold beliefs that contradict Islamic teachings, such as those who believe that Jesus is the son of God. While acknowledging that individuals have the right to express their beliefs, he emphasizes that this right does not extend to promoting or endorsing beliefs that contradict the Quran. 

##  What's the rights, that you have the free, that you have the freedom to make it as I show, is that you will actually release and rebel the future, does not mean that you have a right to do you do it against the material, this guy is Allah command you are committing a sin, so it's going to be endorsed, no, so can you tolerate it, say okay that's your Creed, we're not to get involved with it, yeah and and the state can can decide there will be no punishment, there should be no punishment anyway, for that anyway, that's not an issue of punishment anyway, respect the devil, we understand that he's a devil worshiper, and they're machine with us against that, but Israel is the operation against the Palestinian, and Palestine, but there's nothing that we respect the Satanism or acceptance. 
**Category:** Freedom of Speech

**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that while individuals have the freedom of speech and expression, this freedom does not extend to promoting beliefs or actions that contradict the Quran. He clarifies that Muslims should not tolerate beliefs that contradict Islam, such as Satanism, even though they should be respectful of individuals' rights to express themselves.  

##  But you have set motivation according to your belief that making you March against the Zionist entity in Palestine, for their operation against Nebraska, it does not mean that that you can ask us to, to praise the David, or we can ask you to denounce the devil, I don't know, but we denounce the level, and you, you praise him as much as you like, and you would be uh, I don't see the issue there, if you put the issue in the right place, the electricity, the state may you intervene like that, for example like gay marriage, you are employed, like foreign, should be recorded as civil marriages, and some obviously practicing Christian refused to record and so on, and they were regard as disobedient to the state, I think they, they have the right to, to show this away, but the solution for that is the resign for that job, because you are employed by the state, who says no no no a secular state, it has no, no decayed region, the state does not have any religion, but anyway before that even the registering even civil marriages may have even anathema Also, may have been you should have objected to that even before that even before their marriage, but someone could say okay that's essentially approving that whatever he said already has a an asset information, okay, we swallow that, but in principle it should be, all your interpreters, only a registration, it has nothing to do with regarding that as really a marriage properly and so on for the state purpose and the Dooney apparels, then if it's the same like register in the church marriage or the Islamic Management in in, in, in the British system, it's just a registration, just just the administrative technicalities, does not make it Halal Haram or anything like that, if you give it more value than that, you, it's still out of Islamic marriage, it's just a registration, I'm not approving anything, I'm just in the state record, say this is husband and wife according to the, uh, through the SQL State system.

**Timestamp:** 6595.619s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the issue of state-sanctioned civil marriages, particularly in relation to same-sex marriage. He argues that while individuals have the right to marry according to their beliefs, the state's role is simply to register such marriages for administrative purposes. He clarifies that such registration does not constitute an endorsement of the marriage from an Islamic perspective.

**Timestamp:** 6758.94s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the concept of international law and how it applies to Islamic societies. He argues that while international law should be respected in terms of financial transactions and other non-religious matters, Muslim societies have the right to maintain their own legal system, including the penal code, particularly when it comes to matters of sexual morality.  

##  There was one Muslim man was was found with the whole witness and so on, fornicating with the Christian girl and Ali ordered him to be flogged hundred lashes as they should be and and all that they get to be sent to the Christian, so they'll give her to the people, they would manage it according to Daddy. 
**Category:** Law
**Timestamp:** 6791.96s
**Answer:** The speaker provides a historical example of how Islamic law was applied in a multi-cultural context. He explains that even though a Muslim man committed fornication with a Christian woman, he was punished according to Islamic law, but the woman was handed over to her community to handle according to their own laws.

**Answer:** The speaker distinguishes between punishments in Islamic law that are applied for public offense, such as murder or theft, and those that are specific to religious matters, such as fornication. He argues that punishments for religious offenses are only applicable to Muslims, as non-Muslims have their own legal systems. He also reiterates his condemnation of transgenderism, highlighting the Islamic concept of gender as being determined by biology, not personal feelings.

44.96s:  for this is enough for them to
48.48s:  forsake which they think it's a good
50.719s:  offer it's a good pressure on that on
52.6s:  the other hand the American are trying
54.28s:  it seems to be Netanyahu the moment they
55.84s:  bring something Netanyahu comes but they
57.84s:  don't have the dignity or they are
60.0s:  plotting something else and to come
62.12s:  forward say Hamas accepted nany is
64.68s:  refusing because if they say that the
66.08s:  people say okay so what you're going to
68.0s:  do now stop the say you you you accept
72.2s:  or we lock away your your even there was
75.52s:  a rumor that they offered to Hamas just
78.04s:  give us the American those who American
81.079s:  I think they six or seven or something a
82.799s:  limited number and said for what in
86.0s:  exchange of
87.88s:  what maybe they want to ex change for
90.36s:  for money or something no the minimum
92.399s:  Exchange in that case will be okay we
94.2s:  give you these six provided that you
96.799s:  publicly announce that all weapon
98.84s:  delivered to Israel and ammunition and
101.0s:  so on is stopped just stop it and leave
103.52s:  the rest land for the negotiation and we
105.719s:  give you the seven
108.399s:  guys but this is almost impossible for
111.04s:  these guys to
112.36s:  do because I'm still I'm getting more
114.96s:  and more convinced that the whole
116.2s:  slauter in Gaza and so on is not the
118.039s:  doing of of of Natan is the doing of
120.84s:  Biden ahead of Nat and I mentioned that
123.759s:  before let me stress it
127.8s:  again.com Biden is behind is not is not
131.48s:  only have complicity in the genocide
134.8s:  he's the one order the genocide because
137.12s:  in the we have on record as stated by
139.64s:  Max blumental from from The gry Zone uh
143.84s:  website and he's a very well informed
147.12s:  and very very very thoroughly investig
150.16s:  journalist he dug out what happened when
154.12s:  Bean came to America uh to to be
157.48s:  interviewed and discussed with him with
159.12s:  the with the Foreign Affairs uh
161.84s:  Committee of of the the
164.8s:  Senate and that committee was the people
168.28s:  were seven or eight one of them was
170.0s:  Biden I think it was his F time that was
172.4s:  82 or 83 and all the Senators except
176.08s:  Biden said to to
178.599s:  rebuke p
180.64s:  at the time the Congress has some some
182.36s:  Clouts and they have some men there at
183.959s:  least for some manhood say what you did
186.68s:  there in Beirut is a catastrophic you
188.879s:  you you destabilize the area you did not
191.319s:  succeed anything and then Lebanon is a
193.599s:  very sensitive place because mostly they
195.319s:  are Christian and it will just
197.68s:  destabilize the area and does not serve
199.4s:  Israel You're endangering Israel
201.319s:  destabilizing the area and endangering
203.2s:  in the first place American interest we
205.08s:  don't want instability you want peace so
207.959s:  obviously the American want peace and
209.439s:  stability
210.28s:  not because they love the people eyes
212.239s:  are beautiful black andc mascara no no
215.64s:  because they want to loot it and for
217.319s:  looting getting the oil and getting the
219.599s:  resources you don't want to have be
221.519s:  fighting every day that doesn't work
223.2s:  this way that's not the way Empires work
225.4s:  they want everyone submissive and paying
226.92s:  his taxes and money being collected
229.4s:  nicely that's what they want so they
231.12s:  don't want headache and
233.12s:  and and they rebuked him all of them
235.519s:  rebuked him for that except one this one
238.72s:  is a young man Joe Biden that's in 1982
242.04s:  83 he said I disagree with the honorable
244.879s:  members of this committee Etc I think
247.959s:  you Mr Bean you failed to do the right
250.48s:  way the right action you should have
252.2s:  killed more women and children cuz in
255.64s:  that campaign they tried tried as much
258.4s:  as possible to avoid killing women and
260.28s:  sh they did but they avoided you did not
263.199s:  you did not kill enough women and
264.52s:  children you would have them been more
266.56s:  Victorious and successful so this man is
268.919s:  a genocidal from from that day so I
270.919s:  think when he arrived after October 7
273.919s:  and embraced Netanyahu most likely he
276.52s:  told listen and those guys finish the
279.52s:  problem this was a Hyer opportunity
282.16s:  to yes yes uption good news I am full in
288.16s:  compliance with that and possibly even
290.16s:  in the meeting with the with the
291.28s:  ministers because he met with the
292.6s:  cabinet and met for several for
294.759s:  relatively long time discussing with
296.32s:  them various things clarifying various
298.919s:  promises with them and so on most likely
301.36s:  he also encouraged to complete the job
303.6s:  and just anate the or kick them to to to
307.12s:  S I'm just speculating I was not there
310.12s:  and I am 100% sure that Netanyahu will
312.88s:  not miss the opportunity but this man is
315.759s:  a snake and his misers to make a record
318.759s:  voice record of that so he's keeping the
320.96s:  record anytime Biden dares to put
324.8s:  pressure with come on you are the one
326.68s:  who command us I have the record you
329.4s:  just shut up that's my guess it sound
333.199s:  outlandish but that's my guess that's
335.199s:  commenting on that so that's that's not
337.68s:  getting anywhere but it is they claim ah
340.96s:  Brink will go there again and so on
342.919s:  Hamas said clearly that's we the third
345.52s:  of July final agreement is that what we
347.6s:  stick to it anything else is a waste of
349.44s:  time that's that's not acceptable and
352.16s:  then also ham issued a clear communicate
354.96s:  that any attempt to free hostages by any
357.8s:  military action will will will result in
359.68s:  the hostage being killed we will execute
361.72s:  them right away finish that's it now no
364.68s:  no more nice man we have been nice man
366.68s:  super nice man super nice man super nice
369.16s:  man with the result that the pre the
371.96s:  action before last ended in Kill 237
376.919s:  palestini inent in in in the camp is not
380.0s:  the instument of killing three hostages
383.16s:  and to free for that's not acceptable
385.199s:  anymore you will get only people in
387.68s:  coffins if you want to be in coffins try
390.039s:  it so that's that's where the situation
393.479s:  there the West Bank seem to be putting
397.039s:  more effort in the West Bank the four
399.24s:  days almost continuous fighting they
402.44s:  claim the operation is over but today I
405.56s:  think today morning some uh some hot
408.68s:  blooded
410.24s:  uh uh truck driver coming from the
413.199s:  crossing the standard Crossing not the
415.039s:  crossing where the supply comes to
416.759s:  Israel from the emirat that's another
418.56s:  Crossing The Crossing with the with a
420.96s:  supply uh which someone should block
423.24s:  somehow but until now nobody had the
425.039s:  courage or it is so protected with
427.12s:  viciously
429.199s:  armed thugs of of King Abdullah that's
432.84s:  the one just Hussein King Hussein bridge
436.36s:  that one which the incident happened is
438.199s:  Kama bridge where the famous B of Alama
441.12s:  and the V of Alama nearby there and this
443.039s:  is the main way it seems to be some
445.479s:  truck driver or truck Co driver where
449.52s:  was armed with a with a with a with a
451.24s:  pistol and then when he arrived to the
454.24s:  checkpoint he just disembarked and shot
457.479s:  three people killed him and he got
459.479s:  killed I this action shows this I would
463.039s:  say clearly it is not an organized
465.56s:  action it's a single person that's
467.4s:  number one secondly it shows it is a
470.4s:  reaction a good it shows shows shows
473.52s:  devotion shows willingness to sacrifice
476.319s:  and so on but it is not it is a good
479.199s:  action
480.199s:  from Shar Point know you are are Liberty
483.639s:  to fight the enemies of Allah and kill
485.08s:  them course they are killing Muslim they
486.44s:  are fighting now now it's a state of war
488.12s:  no doubt about that but the problem it
490.039s:  is from a tactical point of view from
492.8s:  effect I
494.599s:  think saying don't say it's
497.159s:  misguided recording
503.0s:  prison analyze it thoroughly and see how
505.759s:  can I do an action which at least not
507.759s:  only three I can get 30 maybe because
510.72s:  you are more valuable than these zon SS
513.919s:  so if you are going to sacrifice
515.919s:  yourself because such an action will end
517.64s:  most likely being getting killed no that
519.839s:  what that then at least
522.8s:  have have have a vision to have to have
525.76s:  a a bigger number or or deign things
528.68s:  much more think about it or organize it
531.64s:  not just casual thinking but people what
534.12s:  they are they are very emotional Muslims
536.56s:  are willing to sacrifice but they are
539.519s:  not yet to up the level of of the mental
542.279s:  sophistication tactical they did not
544.959s:  they did not yet get to the level of
546.76s:  Hamas see how Hamas worked since 2014
551.079s:  the inflammation there until now how
552.8s:  many years 9 years they were working
555.839s:  patiently and slowly and so on you have
559.2s:  to have patient you have to plan Pap but
561.24s:  nevertheless symbolic symbolic symbol
563.959s:  wise the action is will have great
565.959s:  repercussions is will make an incursion
568.839s:  they stop the Bridge they tortured and
571.12s:  mistreated the truck drivers who has
573.399s:  nothing to do with anything and they
575.6s:  delay the people which increase more
578.2s:  hostility and so is again they are as us
581.68s:  digging their own they not digging
585.04s:  only deing it more and more and more
588.72s:  alert so it will have good effects but
592.12s:  even if you think the Maj the the the
595.0s:  Strategic effects and the doctrinal
597.079s:  effects are important also the Tactical
599.64s:  should not be neglected we want to have
601.72s:  those tactics which cause the enemy more
605.04s:  pain and more suffering than otherwise
608.519s:  in addition obviously should see the
610.079s:  Strategic purpose and should the dictor
613.24s:  purpose but the tactics should not to
615.56s:  ignore in just tactic and is just
617.32s:  jumping in in in a butter situation
620.88s:  self-sacrificing without without having
623.8s:  such an effect on the enemy or such
625.92s:  protective result for the for the for
628.16s:  your own side
630.04s:  then it is the is wasteful use of
632.8s:  resources because your life your
636.04s:  en your body your life Staying Alive is
640.56s:  a resource
642.959s:  our to attack the enemies of so that's
645.839s:  my comment on that anyone listening in
648.079s:  Palestine hopefully and and around and
650.16s:  in Jordan should make thoughtful
652.519s:  thinking what to do and just not just
654.76s:  aaction just just a pistol or something
657.72s:  like that think a little bit more
659.72s:  creative and more expanded and discuss
662.6s:  with muah see what you can do analyze
665.36s:  things better and it's better to work
667.72s:  with with a group and so than being
669.839s:  alone be able to direct for
673.12s:  examp
676.0s:  with rebellious and sincere part of they
680.399s:  will be able to get you to do something
682.24s:  which more effective yeah Etc and so
686.56s:  yeah maybe it's more effective if you
688.399s:  would have a with let's say they are
691.16s:  local deeply ingrained in and they have
694.079s:  some resources in the other side they if
696.68s:  you raise with them they they may have
699.24s:  something use you for example as a truck
701.68s:  driver in some smuggling some electronic
704.76s:  devices it's much more important than
707.079s:  can for example so example example
709.44s:  example examp I'm just mentioning those
710.959s:  examples just as an advice don't P just
713.56s:  trigger happy think about what this
716.12s:  tactic will bring how it Ser the
718.36s:  strategy and how the
720.56s:  doctrine yeah so that's one what else is
724.6s:  there yeah and obviously the they they
727.44s:  killed various mujah in Janine Camp as
729.72s:  usual they killed the son of Zakaria
733.839s:  zabidi his son Muhammad 20 21 years old
737.399s:  the Zakaria himself is is detained and
739.639s:  he's the top of the list of the dete of
742.8s:  of the Palestinian which Hamas insist
744.639s:  they must be released Zakaria zabidi
747.079s:  maranti is at the top and Hamas insist
750.8s:  they must be released and no
754.0s:  way any release of Palestinian prisoners
757.639s:  will be accepted without these two and
759.56s:  others like at list to five six
761.32s:  important persons so they uh the killing
764.76s:  of his son and targeting him in a car
766.839s:  with an Israeli uh drone um obviously an
771.519s:  attempt to demoralize his father and
773.92s:  break his heart but most likely it will
775.76s:  fail it will back fire against as usual
777.88s:  all what they are doing alhamdulillah is
779.16s:  is misguided and is backfire against
781.04s:  them all that they can do is do more
783.199s:  pain and bloodshed that's it that's all
785.12s:  what they can do and the more they shed
786.92s:  blood and the Miracles for the muah and
789.36s:  other Spain and the Palestinian the
790.92s:  Muslims the more they dig themselves
792.8s:  deeper so don't Despair and be upset
795.44s:  about that yeah we cannot re ourselves
798.56s:  from being being sad and having the pain
801.519s:  but keep always the over over all vision
806.199s:  of the reality in your
807.959s:  mind okay old vision of on your mind so
811.399s:  that's it what else is there yeah there
814.0s:  was
815.04s:  also from from Yemen we don't hear
818.24s:  anything concerning their their their
820.839s:  their retaliation I my best guess is
823.44s:  that they may synchronize with the Irani
826.04s:  retaliation and then they most likely
828.839s:  they have the the legitimate the
831.12s:  legitimacy to address to attack the
834.079s:  refinery in haa and one or two or
837.279s:  several major po generation facility
839.959s:  because is did the same to them so they
841.92s:  are at Liberty to retaliate in equal
843.68s:  measures okay so but for that you need
846.839s:  like cover of uavs or something else so
849.079s:  it may be a synchronized action between
851.72s:  them and either hisbah or Iran because
854.68s:  the distance does not allow to send UAV
857.279s:  to to do the divertive action nor it's
859.8s:  possible to send sheep Rockets to the
862.0s:  Sheep Rockets are only 100 150 maximum
865.48s:  most of the Rockets used by hisbah for
868.32s:  diverting attention
869.56s:  and the recent action where K and things
873.72s:  like that and these are only 10 15 20 km
876.959s:  the main purpose of that was just to
879.0s:  engage so can fly under that and this
883.199s:  they diday respon all information
886.639s:  affirms that they hit the unit 8,200 and
890.079s:  they think the the commander of the unit
892.199s:  has been killed in this attack and many
894.12s:  others and the building have been
895.68s:  suffered major destruction because I
898.48s:  think 60
899.6s:  you UAV or drones have arrived suicide
903.24s:  drones and they demolish the building
905.24s:  considerably so I think many many people
908.839s:  of this spying organization including
910.68s:  the the the the boss the commander has
913.88s:  been eliminated which I think is a
915.92s:  reasonable retaliation for
918.16s:  auk so that's that's essentially what's
920.639s:  going on and
922.959s:  yeah and we're waiting to see what what
926.519s:  develops further
929.44s:  and uh any moment some some something
932.519s:  major may happen from now on because
934.92s:  clearly the the Seas
937.639s:  fire discussion seems to be have got
940.56s:  stuck and there's nothing indicating
943.0s:  that will be
947.12s:  unstuck we'll do answer in yeah
**Answer:**  The speaker believes the Americans are deceptive and are trying to gain time and keep the hope of a ceasefire alive, despite knowing that the Iranians will not forgive the assassination of their leader and will seek revenge. The speaker is also critical of the Americans, claiming they are only interested in the region's resources and stability for their own benefit. 

##  What is the speaker's view on the recent killings in Gaza?

**Category:**  Gaza

116.2s:  slauter in Gaza and so on is not the
118.039s:  doing of of of Natan is the doing of
120.84s:  Biden ahead of Nat and I mentioned that
123.759s:  before let me stress it
127.8s:  again.com Biden is behind is not is not
131.48s:  only have complicity in the genocide
134.8s:  he's the one order the genocide because
137.12s:  in the we have on record as stated by
139.64s:  Max blumental from from The gry Zone uh
143.84s:  website and he's a very well informed
147.12s:  and very very very thoroughly investig
150.16s:  journalist he dug out what happened when
154.12s:  Bean came to America uh to to be
157.48s:  interviewed and discussed with him with
159.12s:  the with the Foreign Affairs uh
161.84s:  Committee of of the the
164.8s:  Senate and that committee was the people
168.28s:  were seven or eight one of them was
170.0s:  Biden I think it was his F time that was
172.4s:  82 or 83 and all the Senators except
176.08s:  Biden said to to
178.599s:  rebuke p
180.64s:  at the time the Congress has some some
182.36s:  Clouts and they have some men there at
183.959s:  least for some manhood say what you did
186.68s:  there in Beirut is a catastrophic you
188.879s:  you you destabilize the area you did not
191.319s:  succeed anything and then Lebanon is a
193.599s:  very sensitive place because mostly they
195.319s:  are Christian and it will just
197.68s:  destabilize the area and does not serve
199.4s:  Israel You're endangering Israel
201.319s:  destabilizing the area and endangering
203.2s:  in the first place American interest we
205.08s:  don't want instability you want peace so
207.959s:  obviously the American want peace and
209.439s:  stability
210.28s:  not because they love the people eyes
212.239s:  are beautiful black andc mascara no no
215.64s:  because they want to loot it and for
217.319s:  looting getting the oil and getting the
219.599s:  resources you don't want to have be
221.519s:  fighting every day that doesn't work
223.2s:  this way that's not the way Empires work
225.4s:  they want everyone submissive and paying
226.92s:  his taxes and money being collected
229.4s:  nicely that's what they want so they
231.12s:  don't want headache and
233.12s:  and and they rebuked him all of them
235.519s:  rebuked him for that except one this one
238.72s:  is a young man Joe Biden that's in 1982
242.04s:  83 he said I disagree with the honorable
244.879s:  members of this committee Etc I think
247.959s:  you Mr Bean you failed to do the right
250.48s:  way the right action you should have
252.2s:  killed more women and children cuz in
255.64s:  that campaign they tried tried as much

## What was the speech Hass Al Sal gave? 
**Category:** Speech Analysis

0.04s : There's not very much to update except the following. There was, there was a speech by by Hass Al Sal that's is the new title I gave to him for I know this may be upsetting for many people who trusted and believed in in hisbah and so on and he mentioned previous victories of the Palestinian, the great stand of the people of Yemen, maybe he mentioned the Communist Party of China, I don't know. Anyway it did not solve the problem because the problem was his speech a week ago, 10 days ago. 

The speaker is referring to a speech by Hass Al Sal, a leader of a political group. He describes the speech as being focused on highlighting previous victories and struggles of Palestinian and Yemeni people, potentially even referencing the Communist Party of China, but this is unclear. The speaker says that this speech does not address the main issue at hand, which was brought up in a previous speech by Hass Al Sal.


## What is the problem with the speech?
**Category:** Political Analysis

26.4s :  He clearly made it clear that whatever happened in Gaza, even if it's annihilated, he has nothing to do with that. He will be fighting for Lebanon. 

The speaker criticizes Hass Al Sal's speech, specifically his statement that he will be fighting for Lebanon while disassociating himself from what is happening in Gaza. This is considered a problematic stance as the situation in Gaza requires solidarity, not disengagement.


## What are the arguments against Hass Al Sal's stance?
**Category:** Political Analysis

43.0s: Only some people argue this is rational and Leon should not be involved in this war, and it's not opportunistic now to spread the war. That's all fine. That's, I have no problem. Maybe maybe he has an argument in that sense, but the problem, my problem is not this. My problem is that Iran were involved with the Syria regime in killing hundreds of thousands of Syrian. Their hand is full of blood with the argument that we are confronting Israel and we're doing that for Muslims and for Palestine. That's my point now when the situation comes where you have to stand at least remain silent, keep as a boogy man to the world to America and Israel, just don't mention anything, don't say what you are going to do. I'm just, sorry, you fail to do that. So how to understand that bloodshed in Syria? We have to interpret it like what?

The speaker outlines the arguments against Hass Al Sal's stance on the situation in Gaza and Lebanon. Firstly, some argue that it's irrational to not be involved in the conflict in Gaza and that spreading the war to Lebanon is opportunistic. However, the speaker's primary concern is the hypocrisy of those who condemn Israel while simultaneously engaging in the bloodshed in Syria, arguing that their hand is full of blood. They suggest that if you're truly against Israel, then stand against them even if it means remaining silent and not taking action.  This hypocrisy makes it hard to interpret their actions in Syria as anything but sectarian or power-driven, not genuine support for Palestine. 


## What is the speaker's assessment of Hass Al Sal's speech?
**Category:** Speech Analysis

186.599s : That fig leaf has been torn away. The speech yesterday was it yesterday? Yeah yesterday, did not change anything. He mentioned the great the heroism of the Iranian, and the heroism of this, the hero of this. We know that there may be heroes. We're not discussing that. Maybe he mentioned, I just said the Communist Party of China just as a joke maybe the commun of China. That's not the issue. You claimed and killed 100,000 of Syrian under the claim that these are undermining the front which confront Israel, the resistant front. Now the time for you to be a resistant front and you failed. That's my point. Close the chapter until he proved otherwise, leave him aside, let's go back to what's happening. 

The speaker concludes that Hass Al Sal's speech was ineffective and did not change anything. He argues that the speech was full of empty rhetoric, referencing heroes and the Communist Party of China, while failing to address the real issue. Specifically, he highlights the hypocrisy of claiming to be against Israel while also engaging in the killing of Syrians. The speaker suggests that this exposes the true motives of those who support Hass Al Sal, and that they are not genuinely concerned with supporting Palestine. 


## What is the current battle situation in Gaza?
**Category:** Military Analysis

228.56s :  Yes, the suffering of the civilian in and and the genocide committed by by the Is, Is, very clear. But according to the best information from certain underground sources but also American analyst sources, because there, there are continuous analysis in the CNN and so on, relying on satellite photos and information, some American analysts have access from from their friends in the American forces and other sources, although they obvious not at Liberty to give all information in detail or the sources. But it seems to be the following until now there's no real battle in Gaza yet. There there were two, we could say two, uh two battles maybe two, only two, one few days ago in which commanding general or a colonel, a commander of a division was killed with his secretary and so on in in one meraba used, obviously as a headquarter, and a good number of tanks have been annihilated, maybe hundreds. So kill this one, and yesterday about 20 plus, uh uh uh, tractors and things that called Alat, machinery, machinery of the war, both tanks and soldier car and so on, and a good number of solders have been also annihilated by by in a in a battle of several hours with Hamas. So until now barely barely any real battle has happened and they have barely penetrated anywhere in the back street and the ti, they have the Main Street going to hospital. By the way, they destroyed the shifa hospital generator, so there's no electricity there, so that everyone will die there who needs electricity and they are at the seaside. That's all what they have penetrating deep in the street, fight. They will most likely, mytim, they will be annihilated. Until now the total count of the American analyst and other analyst is at least 160 U machines and tanks and so on and the number of soldier this estimate, differ but the minimum estimation by rece serious analyst is in baz itself, 800 to a 1,000, beside the over thousand killed outside on SE. So the battle is way ahead, away, far away from being being over and as a matter of fact I think yesterday or this morning Hamas issued certain conditions for the seed fire, so they're making conditions there are such you know, situation that they are making conditions. So the situation is not bad and maybe Allah will make it so that beside exposing, and the other in Iran and elsewhere they are exposed while the the the poist Shia Islamic resistance in Iraq, they, they seem to be clearly independent from Iran and they seem to be clearly acting on their own impulse, Islamic impulse and also the am many, they have proven themselves although they can not participate very much but they stand is very clear that they are honest that they, so the demonstration which were in the millions and millions saying death to Is, America is not just a slogan, it's sincere and the same with the Shia underground or the Shia population in Iraq, not the leadership and not the Iranian factions, so we have that alhamdulillah. 

The speaker describes the current situation in Gaza as not yet a full-fledged battle, with only two major engagements having occurred. One resulted in the death of a high-ranking commander and a significant number of tanks, while the other saw the destruction of machinery and a large number of soldiers. Despite this, the speaker believes that the battle is far from over and that Israeli forces have not been able to penetrate deep into Gaza. He also mentions that Hamas has issued ceasefire conditions, suggesting that they are in control of the situation and not in a desperate position.


## What is the speaker's overall analysis of the situation in Gaza?
**Category:** Military Analysis

852.0s: But it's look, it looks good. It looks good, it's not as bad, and the test came for for Hass in parenthesis or without parenthesis and he failed the test, that's it. And Iran the same thing, the test they failed. Well, they did not fail the test. The the Islamic forces in Iraq, they did not fail the test. They are opposite, they are they are forcing themselves and asserting themselves and the Irani, the the the Islamic resistance in in in in Iraq, they said clearly what we are doing is not is not related toaz directly in that sense. Yes, it's in support of, but the the target is to get America out of the area, out of Iraq, completely fighting America. This may be supportive for that was going in Gaza, but in Gaza, we can't do very much. It's too far away yet but here we are, doing and they, and they were true to their word and they increasing according to their means. Their means are relatively limited. They don't have the means of otherwise they would have swept Americans long ago. 

The speaker believes that the situation in Gaza is not as bad as it seems, with Hamas showing resilience and holding its own against Israeli forces. This contrasts with the situation of Hass Al Sal, who is seen as having failed the test and becoming weak. The speaker acknowledges that the Islamic forces in Iraq have also passed the test, demonstrating their independence and their focus on fighting against America. While they cannot directly intervene in Gaza, they remain committed to their mission and will continue to push for America's departure from Iraq.

That's the first level actually there must be some other terms higher than that, it must be more more complex than that, and those terms will undermine and annihilate any possibility, so meaning the theory is that not that God was no no, it doesn't need to step in, it's impossible that such an invest cannot be, it may be not even creatable when first place it has to be a little bit more sophisticated and complex than that, and that one cannot be, there's no way you can't go back in time, that's take that from me and the guarantee by the value of the Quran that we're going to see of necessity of reason now that's not although the way gradually Express it is a little bit enjoyable literacy.

## 10322.84s 
**Question:** I wonder if there's like we can make like an an absolute cause for it because it it doesn't seem feasible so so so from the Islamic perspective if if a Muslim Muslim he he he argues for example for homosexuality or he he he calls for homosexuality or or even worse than that for example mocking the religion mocking God mocking the prophet he's he's he's immediately C because Allah said no I'm let me finish let me finish let me that was not last question last question does the state do anything with that yes yes so so here so here just let me clarify that if this Muslim he he he just committed apostasy because because he called for something that contradicts Islam we need to check has he left the community we discussed that this is challenging the the order by or or or de facto either de facto being a warrior yeah absolutely absolutely so so I mentioned that but that was not the question yes I'm just clarifying because I'm going to I'm going to go to the to those who non-believers who who who who who who who who who want to who want to argue for homosexuality or for example anything not warranted by Islam I'll just I'll go I'll go there but for for the Muslim who's um who who who who committed apostasy for calling for something that contradicts Islam depart from the community or Depart of community absolutely there has to be a trial for him at least whether he departed or not departed so we can check that's something El that's not that's because he made an act of War that's something else I see I see okay okay it's not the M expression itself I I understand in such a way that is challenging the order or reporting the community that's something else otherwise he commit fine if you if if you decide you not the state to to to say he should not inherit from us you go and file to the court and get get a ruling that heated and he cannot inherit yeah so in any case there has to be a trial for him that has nothing to do state stepping in and preventing him from expressing himself it's from the Judiciary System the that's the judici will not prevent him from exing but make the ruling related to him became an apost is not related to freedom of expression Freedom ex that you can exess whatever you want without the state either sensoring you in advance or preventing you from saying it or punishing you for that saying for that for the saying that's it the other thing something else I see because because let's move for example to the nonbelievers who want to say something abominable against Islam or Muslims for for example let's take the and let's take this example of um of this Jewish Arabi who who who said that Allah isting in the Quran yeah so here Abu Bakr he went to him and he argued that if there wasn't no Covenant between us Muslims and you uh jewi you will be put to death so it seems to me and and and and then no no no no but but he went to the messenger Allah and he rebuked Abu Bak no no prophet he met he did not say anything he did but he did not do anything to him that's the pration when do you got to do with him yes so my argument is that the Covenant the Covenant saved Sav theck no no no they didn't say the say if he repeats he has broken the Covenant he can repeat it and still he's in the Covenant yeah so so so because the Covenant is binding he can say whatever he wants now now let's take for example a group of people who are out of the state who who don't have um a Le a covenant or an an agreement with Muslim if for example let's take Sweden like they have like a neutral status with with an Islamic entity but ABAB I know what you are shooting for if the one in the domain is if saying that does not break the Covenant the one outside is not having a covenant are not breaking anything unless it's an act of War yeah so so that's my argument is that because because we don't have a covenant for example if that would have been an to court just by expressing this statement yeah it would have broken the Covenant so how can we War for someone outside and this is an instigation to war yeah because because we don't we don't have a CO a covenant with the other state and the outside domain yes canot prohibit or do anything unless it is an instigation of War then he is instigating for war he's doing an act of War that's something else but wouldn't be wouldn't it be considered an act of War why should it be considered if this one is not breaking the Covenant because it s acted War for one inside it would break the Covenant oh yeah yeah you are going in circle we talking what the state does in preventing it from being expressed and after ex punishing it for the expression not the result of the expression that he is excluded from inheritance or this or this or cannot marry your sister that's something else that's according to your ruling or the judicial ruling let's for example take aaf you know this man is aaf but he nominal Muslim he comes to to ask the the the hand of the sister or the daughter of your neighbor in that case you can't go to NE say listen I know this guy he's secretly a CF is's your your daugh your daughter or sister is too too pure and clean to be married to that one reject him that's it that's all that you have nothing else so the state cannot take any step further than that no unless it's some Judiciary issue related like inheritance marriage things like that yeah yeah yeah anything lower than capital punishment yeah or or for example husband and wife apostas and something KU then the state may may save the children because they the children belong to them but the children were born in Islam now they apiz they their has been lifted by apost take the kids they can't utter what they ever say until yeah yeah yeah naturally yes the question of was can the state do something for that expiration no not for that expiration but they apostas they can't blubber what they say until as long as not a declaration instigation of war but the kids now born as as with them when they were Muslims but they and registered as Muslim born they cannot be left in their custody they may be until six years then after that take them away so the statement or the argument ofak against this jei is is wrong isn't it when he said that it's not it's not wrong it's not wrong yeah but because but but didn't not say if he repeats it that he breaks the Covenant so so it doesn't break the Covenant so abak is a mistaken somehow he thought that Covenant is protecting him from this or I don't know what what abak thought butak is not relevant relevant the M did did he order him not to repeat if he repeat who should be killed no I see I see I see what Allah commented did fin yeah finally Professor from the Practical perspective because because because from my understanding is that if you open if you open wide freedom of speech you will have many silly people coming like this who who ultimately does let him let him let him until he reach the level of instigating War yeah one question we've got in the UK Professor but he is affecting H and and making people that's the mistake that said Allah also affecting because hundred of thousands of people are are seeing him and not seeing the H you have to take care that the H is being perpetuated the the the the duty of the state then to get other people respond to him they can't come to State prevent him or or or punish him no no respond to him here he's the platform in the that giving you enough time in in television and so on yeah in the state television if the state can own television on Islam and so on which is question mark by the way but assume that they have to give the other point of view obiously better otherwise they are condoning that there's a question about the state itself Dr adim he Dr IIM he presented like a better solution for that he said whomever made an makes an outrageous Claim about religion he he must be Tri in in front of a jury just to question his intent to bring a backup for his proof you know like like like you would do with any that's not a good solution how how do you do that with the Jews who claim that that they say about that's all gone in history you see my proof is what the Quran Reve so we don't believe in your Quran it's so he says like like you do in any other profession for example anyone who claims he's a doctor and puts his hand a patient he need no no that's something else that's something else because this is a profession this something present like for example if you insult someone of adultery he can sue you and the usual process goes but if he s someone in history of adultery like maram it's just gone cannot be sued now will be finished be the state question of R is reallyy can the state put a limit I told him was the limit for the state yeah you are confusing with and yeah yeah yeah and ignoring what the messenger of Allah is doing taking ab and foret M of Allah the same with the when when when when say send to the the tribes they will get you their heads that's no problem they say the repeat it again they are compan publicly they are companion and they monaf but that but that's for a capital punishment how about like anything lower than that for example imprisonment or paying chares this case was in front of him he did not do anything of [Music] that yeah because when you think about it in the practical sense no no because it do in the pr we are used over centuries of this rubbish since the time of of of mua centy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if you look at it carefully it's from the time of mu ESS was that yeah indeed the following story has been narrated that that Abu sufyan went to to said is anyone here because he was blind and later his blind in eyes after being blind in heart for all his life and then he said said no nobody say say listen there's there's no hell on of paradise it is just a kingdom play with it like you play with with a ball like kids with ball andman screamed at him and kicked him out okay a lat scholar said I'm not be amazed about AB sufyan saying something like so he said sufyan is worthy of saying something but I'm amazed about not striking his neck and say was right that's you don't strike because he's following the and that's he following the of the messenger of Allah you just kick him out of your place that you have the right in in your presence as head of state or in house you can't tell people go out I don't want to listen to you that's your right that's all what he has nothing else he did exactly so this latest scholar is in the mentality I don't say like your mentality but stuck in that in the tradition which they so the Jews and Christian having conferen in the it's a heretic burn the heretic put him on the steak Christian is not what what M Allah has did all his life nor nor what the Quran indicate of course we're not we're not talking about those who instigate others for war against against Muslims War yeah that's that's went and instigated qur for war encouraging him to wage war against Muhammad finally finally here's a here's a practical Point like we need to consider in our discussion what about governments for example the government of France like we saw from maon he encourages magazines that would mock Prophet Muhammad or he he would allow banners against mocking Muslims and so on while he is staying to analyze if if when he bans anything against Jews and or other no that's is it relevant to study it is it is it really an act of War what would be the ruling in this case is it an an act of it has to be analyzed I don't think we bother our head with such exoteric case I would say in that case you terate relation with them terminate all commerci relation with them if you are serious and threaten them with with with War action see what happens they will come Pi like he came the moment we started boycotting he came Bing in Al jaaz saying oh because we have to comply with the law and so on yeah yeah and think okay comply with your law and also with the European Court said this is not covered by because it instigate internal strife in the society you as a state should keep the peace between the various factions absolutely car someone to insult the religion of others you are endangering the peace that's what the European Court of Human Rights said endangering the peace and the social cohesion is not matter of freedom of exibition yeah danger essentially you are you're putting the conditions for civil strife and bloodshed in that Reas I think that's very rational argument of the of of the the same you can apply this a very reasonable argument I see I see I see because done such a provocative not say we don't believe he's a messenger we have a conference about refuting the messenger of Muhammad fine we sent our delegatory and show you that you are wrong and bring our evidence that's no problem but using it in such a mockery way is instigating and and mocking and so on is definitely uh um is definitely uh abusive and instigate civil strife and may instigate people to start war and things like that then another issue is another crime then not just expr itself yeah encouraged by government not by individuals or by individual doing like for example that magazine is s for examp magazine is Attack Attack the Trinity we know the Trinity is false but they show like three persons doing sodomy to each other this is disgusting that's not the way sity is nonsense or or or or imagination the myth is not a reality but you're not three person of TR doing Soom to each other that's disgusting that's offensive should be punished because it offended the feeling of people and could cause it actually in the case of because Muslim are sensitive not like Christian now they have the declined completely they it ended that someone got his neck cut it should not have come to them without the French government committing that so she responsible for the blood of this guy being killed does not mean that the guy guy who killed him is right or wrong but they are responsible they instigate and if you instigate something like that you have a backlash and you have Bloodshed and your job as a government is to keep the

**Answer:** The speaker asks the Professor for a practical perspective on freedom of speech in the context of Muslims living in the West.  The Professor clarifies that the state's responsibility is to maintain peace and order, and that intervention is only justified when speech directly incites violence or threatens public safety.  The Professor emphasizes that the responsibility of individuals to respond to offensive speech is critical, and that the state's role is not to censor or punish speech itself, but to protect public order.

**Question:** I just want to ask you know um is there from the text is there any prohibition so imagine someone wants to become a citizen um non-muslim or want citizenship um can we put down in the stipulation that not to insult just to avoid all this hassle of someone wants to insult Prophet Isam then this is um prohibited or is that not allowed from the text you can't put that it could be could made an injunction for all citizen even Muslim or non Muslim or so on even way put it and it's punishable and things like that yeah someone is born in the domain yeah to of the citizenship okay so that's something different um this case another may put condition but I don't think putting such condition makes anything in the first place okay because most people are reasonable they will they will make it in in into intellectual discussion only those who want to cause war or mischief or something they will they will use abusive and insulting language okay you make a for just few criminal cases no no that's fine I I want to know from the thingy because he gave comparative on human rights and does this violate and all these things yeah which is which is fine I want to know from um from the text the other question um from this came my thought came it comes been wanting to ask this for a long time um you know the issue ofur and Islam the as a citizens so if someone in the Muslim land and I wanted to get a comparison because if someone wants to reject the Western citizenship they can say look I don't want your protection nothing obviously he's going to get kicked out if he's from in the UK or any of the Western lands you don't want it nowhere is you're basically violated our covenant therefore because you know the issue of um there was a people who say that look it's kuur and so therefore everything Hal the taxation all of that scamming milking from the system Etc but if someone's come here so is this is my understanding correct if someone's come here like I came to this country for example not I I was born in this country my father's um came back in the 60s born in this country um my father British Sean or something yeah if I came to this country like um then as a student or became a citizen here yeah because of sponsorship whatever so there's a contract there so is that an equivalent from the Shar that look we have a covenant and we have to stick by this Covenant yeah a covenant the Covenant is Covenant of protection or or that's correct they don't kill them they don't kill you don't take their money etc etc yeah you keep at peace with them mean that you can join their army and fight Muslim etc etc yeah okay now if this the other way um so you know the people who say that look if you have no Covenant with them there's uh that harbon Etc um give me aete example what's me the other way what's the other way the my heard is this yeah the DAR har so the taxation all of this no no you are even if it's Dar har you have a covenant that is valid for you don't worry about the har of the others you are excluded from the issues of har and and peace because the only way that will make sense if someone came through um by stealth or whatever they came to C something they came to do Chief is fine yeah that's fine if he came without Covenant and sneaked in and then and I said that already in 2005 if an Iraqi at the time they were occupying Iraq come sneaks in the country and assassinate Tony Blair he's a liberty to do that and they wanted to go to the crime persecution service the said he's saying Iraq is sneaking in without any Covenant and he's he's fighting occupation Force just shut up go no case yeah what is the question now I don't know was that question so if anyone came like that and they had a child because how the so is it basically the point is is it transferred so my father came here is a British Sean but if you are if you born here you get the citizenship the citizenship is a covenant between you you have then obviously you are not responsible for ACT until you get out of age after that you have the choice if you keep the citizenship then you are bound by the Covenant or you leave so I don't know what the question yeah that's it because they never made sense to me because how can the have a covenant Muslim in a of focus on that why you looking at it's not the same here you are having a covenant was born here you have it until you come out after that you decide I don't want this domain I want to be Warrior then you have to relinquish the Covenant because they assume you have a covenant with them so go out and throw the bport in their face and start War welcome no problem yeah because there the whole issue of tax evasion and tax scam and all these things so that's another issue is other tax legitim so that's something else that you can do even an Islamic domain but this is we don't want to go in this this messy details let's get the general structure you think this you don't want to stay with a covenant you have to to declare that the system assume you are a citizen and they are in Covenant you have to tell the system no I breaking I'm going out but you have to do to do it announce it to them the best way is to go out and burn the passport or throw the passport in their face so is from their side if they were to do you know set you up the Secret Service U you know things what's Secret Service explain more clearly so you know the um the framing so they do false flag Etc if someone wants to put you in prison if it it's done to you and and you know it and you have evidence for that then they have broke the Covenant they have done then you are at War here then you can hide somewhere and do whatever you want but if they do it really and you are convinced you have evidence for that or do it through legal action yeah because you know the whole issue of if it's War then it's certain nature you do certain action because if someone's just claiming benefits um yeah all of these secondary issues focus on the point if they break the Covenant you are at Liberty they have broken it you don't need to declare they did it if you want they didn't any break of the Covenant you want to break the Covenant you go out that's correct yes it's very clear beating around the bush does not help because the Covenant here the the issue which exclude you from the relation to the rest of the um except that you cannot wage war against the um even they cannot come to you for example say listen you are your father is from Pakistan so a British citizen you are born British so you are from us now wanted to spy on Muslims or go to from ctis say sorry guys it's out that's not my understanding of citizenship if you want to force me I am to war with you get lost they will not come the moment you tell them that they will disappear right away trust me with that so that's it or they violate your rights break the Covenant or they take the C away they can do the system allows some other system do not allow Tak you have to give it you understand so the only thing I want to come back on unless I miss heard you you're saying that because as a citizen if they you know the inscription and Etc if there's a you have to refuse like mammed Al refused yeah simp because you I cannot join your war machine because I am Muslim I'm B by Islam to to fight against Muslims and fight against others unless it is in self-defense you send me to Vietnam is not self-defense you're defending your capitalist system over the devil I don't care about what you're defending but if an enemy invad the country then I will start in defending as a self-defense simple the ruling is very simple we can I think that's discussed even our book of in deta something which is not translated but yeah that's Reas if you if you took the things properly the answer is very clear so the the going back to earlier on about an hour ago that's what some Algerian especially were doing here say stealing and so and cars and claiming this is the domain of har we can't do that maybe they sneak then maybe they are doing that but some of them did not sneak and they say can do whatever yeah but you are not you are excluded from they may be they fighting in Iraq yes they are for all Muslims in the world except the who have a covenant excluding them you are now here you are excluded go out and sneak or declare or do an action which takes you out to Covenant if you are there to do it would it mean the definition of sneaking in if they falsified all the information and came into this country whatever it is sneaking in yeah that's all these possibilities are there okay so I want to go back to your point you know you're saying I just want to get clarification as the people of um who are holding the rulers um in place whether it's military or tribes Etc um these people obviously have the power they're the ones who supporting the rulers apart from them is it a individ obligation for in the Muslim lands where there's the Muslims majority they have the Muslim Army is it obligation on the individuals as well is that what what you're saying um for them to fight obligation of the it's if sufficient people do it then but everyone is have part of the obligation because it's canot be obligation on a single individual but what do you see the ruler and the Army protecting him and the the royal guard or whatever presidential guard what what what what you meant can we fight no no my point is that from the reality the people who are the military who are actually supporting um the and who have the power to go for example in Egypt they have a border with um Palestine so they could easily um that's that's theoretically but they are supporting the ruler they are part of the ruling system they are the enemy no no that's what I'm saying so these so these people so in the they have the power and as Muslims individuals who are there citizens is K fire on them um to actually uh as a as to fight brother you discussing if they are supporting the ruler and they know that the ruler is betraying Islam and Muslim mus Muslim must sorry if that's inor I'm saying the why are mentioning those around the ruler are mentioning the mass I don't understand what the relation I don't know what which reality you are describing that we can make a ruling about it so the rule the people in the military they have they're the ones who are trained who have the equipment Etc they're the on who are supporting the regime yeah okay so they're the ones who naturally have that um Power and Equipment they are with the regime what do you expect them to do unless you have someone sneaking in there and make a that's something else yeah I don't understand the question the question is Muslims for example in Egypt the um who

walk walk up in this case I would advise everyone who walks up there keep a low profile even if you meet their meeting and they drink drink with them with the intention to destroy them what's a question that's question what tactics how to do a revolution this has to be decided in every place by its condition but that regime has to be removed because the um the majority are are having intrinsically the power they have to activ if you can activate it as a as a as a commander in the army of a unit for example you are in the in the in the presidential God and you woke up and then

## When they use the word "M", is it usually related to something that was obligatory for the Prophet (PBUH)? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 0.32s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the word "M" is often used in discussions about the Prophet's (PBUH) actions, and it is important to understand that not everything he did was obligatory for his followers.  Just because he performed an action does not automatically make it obligatory for others. 

## What is the speaker's explanation for why something the Prophet (PBUH) did not do may not be considered obligatory? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 3.959s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that if the Prophet (PBUH) did not perform an action, it could be for various reasons, including it being a permissible action but not obligatory, undesirable, or even forbidden. Therefore, simply because he didn't do something doesn't mean it's forbidden.

## What does the speaker say about the concept of "nothingness" being evidence for anything? 
**Category:** Logic
**Timestamp:** 22.519s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the absence of something cannot be used as evidence for anything.  "Nothingness" has no inherent meaning or implication, so it cannot be used to prove or disprove a claim. 

## When the Prophet (PBUH) performs an action and then leaves it, what can you conclude about the action?
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 33.04s
**Answer:** When the Prophet (PBUH) deliberately left an action after doing it, it indicates that the action is not obligatory. He may have left it because it was optional, undesirable, or forbidden.

## What does the speaker mean when they say that the Prophet (PBUH) "deliberately left" an action? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 53.079s

## How does the speaker explain the concept of "Bid'ah"? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 505.36s 
**Answer:** The speaker describes how "Bid'ah" (innovation in religion) is often wrongly framed and made into a significant issue that overshadows more important aspects of faith. This extreme focus on "Bid'ah" can lead to harmful religious practices.

## What does the speaker say is the issue with people concluding things based on face value without considering fundamental principles? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 345.6s 
**Answer:** The speaker argues that people often make assumptions based on surface interpretations of Hadiths (Prophet's sayings) without considering the underlying principles of Islamic law. This can lead to incorrect interpretations and conclusions.

## What is the basic ruling of permissibility in Islam? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 372.24s
**Answer:**  The speaker explains that the basic ruling of permissibility in Islam is that everything is permissible unless proven otherwise. This means that actions, thoughts, and behaviors are assumed to be allowed unless explicitly forbidden by Islamic teachings.

## How does the speaker address the argument that incorporating an act into one's worship makes it recommended?
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 386.319s 
**Answer:** The speaker states that even if someone incorporates a certain act into their worship and considers it recommended, it doesn't automatically make it a valid religious practice unless there is evidence to support it.

## What is the speaker's main argument against the claim that celebrating the Prophet's (PBUH) birthday is obligatory? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 408.36s 
**Answer:** The speaker argues that celebrating the Prophet's (PBUH) birthday is not an Arabic tradition and there is no evidence to suggest it is obligatory. While the Prophet (PBUH) did praise Monday as a blessed day, this doesn't mean celebrating his birthday is obligatory.

## What does the speaker say about the practice of stoning the Devil with stones of a certain size?
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 639.2s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the Prophet (PBUH) emphasized using small stones for stoning the Devil and cautioned against going to extremes in devotion. This is because previous nations were destroyed due to their extremism, and exaggerating the practice could lead to violence and destruction.

## How does the speaker respond to the argument that incorporating rituals into worship is the root of extremism? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 689.48s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that this argument is faulty because the Prophet (PBUH) specifically instructed to use small stones and avoid extremism in religious practices. He also provided examples of previous nations destroyed due to their extremism. 

## What is the speaker's explanation for the Prophet's (PBUH) statement about previous nations being destroyed? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 721.48s 
**Answer:**  The speaker points out that the Prophet (PBUH) mentioned previous nations being destroyed in relation to two specific examples: the one about the size of stones for stoning the Devil and another about punishing the poor differently from the rich. This shows that the statement wasn't meant to apply to all forms of religious extremism.

## Why does the speaker suggest that it is important to go back to the Quran for clarification on fundamental issues? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 942.48s
**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of referring to the Quran for guidance on fundamental issues.

The Quran, being divinely protected, provides a more reliable and complete source of understanding.

## How can the Quran insist Maria is the daughter of Imran, while all available texts before Islam don't mention that?
Category: Quran
1.0s: That the Quran insists stubbornly that Maria the daughter of Imran. And but all available texts in the hand of Christian before obviously for for the inception of Islam and after that and all of them are actually before Islam anyway even the one who was allegedly allegedly supposed to be an an Arabic translation, an early transition to Arabic with my Syriac document we'll come to that yesterday the headlights are there and how much reliable is that. That all of them that don't mention mariam in tamil I told him the daughter of someone called him so the ramrod is not mentioned then the usual stun an explanation which I think, nobody is doing it now because it is just it's a if someone claimed that will make himself disgraceful that it's actually muhammad is so stupid let me use these words liberally and they will use try to be neutral not saying messenger or revelation or no revelation just mention the various point of view as neutral as possible that is associated with that he confused maryam the sister of of haroon and the sister of musa which is obviously as you know 1500 years roughly that's the best estimate some people say it's only 1200 years but over millennium before the time of Christ with with maryam the model of Christ. 

## If Muhammad was so ignorant, why does the Quran expand the story of Musa, but never mentions his sister? 
Category: Quran
2.0s: This is this could be only assumed really nobody will will will make such a blunder except someone who is utmost stupidity and ignorance about the scripture but just a casual scanning through the Quran the story of musa is expanded very in very details with never anywhere his sister or the small family conflict which has been recorded in in the in the constitution the so-called torah. 

## Why does the Quran place so much importance on Maryam, even going so far as to say that she was favored by God?
Category: Quran
3.0s: The Quran insists on maryam bin tamra is number one. Just keep this point in mind. 

##  What is the Quranic narrative of Maryam's life? 
Category: Quran 
4.0s: Secondly now we go to the story of maryam Quran it is expanded actually in two places first one is the nativity and they showed the career that's in surat al-imran and the other one in surat maryam let us start with according to the order of the Quran although the the because this is one coronerically chronologically it should be earlier than the one in in in surat maryam but obviously in the order of the Quran and even also in the other revelations thought mariam is amaki with certitude that's there's no doubt about that. 

##  Why was Maryam's story revealed to the prophet in Mecca?
Category: Quran
5.0s: So many narration even it has been recited to the negos jashi the king of Abyssinian there were discussion about Jesus and his nature and so on. There are various famous narrations in Islamic history so it is a maki while al imran is a dis portion specifically is related to a debate under and and the challenge to a mutual conversation with the christian delegation coming from azeroth that is in the tenth year the last year of the prophet century so revelation wise even the maryam part is earlier but in the order of the Quran this is India in the order so let's go the other Quran because this is also the part of the story is before getting pregnant and giving birth. 

## What is the story of Zakaria and his wife?
Category: Quran
6.0s: Imraan's wife said mentioned this event was elect behold lord I have vowed to you what is what what is in my womb to be holy is dedicated to you accepted from me you you hear and know all things.

## How does the Quran portray Zakaria's life?
Category: Quran
7.0s: And when the career visits here in the in in the inner sanctuary in the maharab in the altar near secretary he found she had she had sustenance food sisters. He said mary mariam how did you get this she said it is from god god provides bounty for whom he wills. 

##  How does Zakaria’s life fit into the larger narrative of the Quran?
Category: Quran
8.0s: He said lord be gracious to me and give me such blessed blessed child you certainly hear prayers. So let me see the arab because he asked for a child specifically I will ask for someone who will take over the priesthood after him yeah yeah he said he offspring so he asked for the ali for offspring so he wanted himself strings most likely in his mind maybe from relative from cousins from himself not necessarily for himself god also the sons of your brothers are regarded your offspring in the general sense especially in a in in the semitic foundation arabic islam and jewish tradition it is it is the the children of your your cousins etc are regarded like your children. 

## What is the significance of the "Word of God"?
Category: Quran 
9.0s:  God gives you the good news of John of johannes confirm a word from god that's that's a significant word who will be confirming a word from god and this word from god is supposed to be isolated but so giving the title word from god is obviously ancient if the if that's a revelation the Quran says that reality was called the word from god is correct and seem to we have historic root but that's provided we claim the quran is for a divine revelation this is the truth but keep that at the side then as a question mark.

## What is the story of Maryam's pregnancy and giving birth?
Category: Quran 
10.0s: She said she was a state of shock lord how can I have a boy actually is wrong because it is what she said how can I have an offspring wallet is not boy.

Now let me that this virgin birth is a very sore point for the modern and analysts of this people discussing the the old testament and refuting many aspects then you would stem it refuting many aspects of it with good reasons like our video I gave it to lux hopefully in fdu they discussed about the story of the birth and obviously the attack also the virgin path and they mentioned Islam also approved believes the very verse and they think the best has been disproved what has been disproved is the story about bethlehem and so on and the evidence they brought is devastating no doubt about that.

## How does the Quran describe the events leading up to Maryam's pregnancy?
Category: Quran 
12.0s: Mention in the book the story of maryam when she would draw from her family to a place toward the east so this is not in the temple yeah she would draw from her family and said in taberna that and tablet she extracted herself. So it looks like she it was like a little struggle because this was for example the untouchable India called mahmoud the untouchable the rejected one so she instructed herself she rejected herself so they maybe have some discussion and things like that and she pulled herself out from them maybe they were not very happy about this.

**Question:** so this is the question the brothers kindly put into writing there is a Hadith about Aisha who is referring to qur'ash fasting uh the ashora before Islam and after Ramadan became obligatory the prophet that whoever wants to fast fast whoever whoever who doesn't want to don't there is a famous Hadith about the prophet wanting to fast on the ninth day but not being able to because of his death okay that producer from IBN Abbas so um so I if if we'll get all these asses whether it's not then kind of let me give you the summary what he wants really but he did not know how to summarize the the majority of people go to the Hadith positions in bukhari I don't know anybody else the witch claims when he arrived in Medina he so followed the Jews fasting a day say what is this day you are fasting that's Hadith claims that they said this is a day Allah saved Musa from forever okay you're following me he's jumping up yeah I'm sure he'll be able to see him later on well and Musa fasted it and we fasten it like that to be fasted the problem with this Hadith the main Authority most people use it is that historically first of all it is strange that the messenger Allah asks us to ask the Jews about today they are fasting that's number one he never asked him I will take off their D that's number one that's what that's the only situation with us secondly they say when he arrived in Medina seems to from the context it was the day he arrived the day he arrived the day he arrived was not not was Yom Kippur that's the day they are fasting we know that the day of atonement but that's not the day Allah that's the day the 70 men who were killed were killed by by by by a thunderbolt in Mount Sinai because you asked to see Allah and uh were killed by Allah Oscar was trying to revive them and they revived them and as a tank maybe Musa how fast did that so there's some thought in the story there's some question mark about the whole situation so we have to study let's not see if there's anything but it seems to be it's related to the first thing of the use of young people or the they they told him it is that he's fasting because Allah revived these and the Muslim thanks Allah but some narrator confused that with saving for Veron and added that from his imagination it seems to be the sahaba oil fasting they were and those killed in calculating the the tense of uh of uh was killed in calculating it according to the calendar of the Jews and their plastic according to calendar of the Jews not to to the level calendar it seems to be because there have been a relation that they were going to say the fabric to calculate them that a problem they according to the luniz solar calendar of the Jews and it happened by miraculous coincidence is that the day the day Hussain was melted it was the tenth of the sharing and the tenth of maharla and after that it became the tense of Muhammad and everyone starts with Iran nobody was shaking with the Jews after that so that means all of this need to be clarified strengthen the fact that it is that are abused to fast search for some reason and the rosary was fasting it as Total War or or that as a as a fasting and then uh Ramadan came and this was abrogated so the whole matter is a bit upside down it needs more thorough
**Answer:** The speaker is asking about the historical context of the fast of Ashura and whether it is actually related to the Jewish fast of Yom Kippur. They are also questioning the reliability of the Hadith that mentions the Prophet asking the Jews about their fast. 

## 7681.08s: Category:  Interpretation 
**Question:** anyone else the brothers got a follow-on question apologies I think he wants some clarity on on this so in the same example around somebody immigrating and if they have the choice from between a more religious relation and a less belligerent one so what if we make more money in the US I have job opportunity it doesn't matter it doesn't matter I already say it doesn't matter you have the right here and there there's nothing to do with religion if you go there you do a Covenant security access that's it as long as you can protect your Dean you can you're not that fight against Muslims it's it's not desirable it's not a desirable State of Affair definitely then you rank things according to your to your understanding you say that you make more money that's balance things maybe make your money is better for you and Twitter for the um than going to Sweden where you are begging and getting maybe uh benefit well in America you can make money which helps the ummah and helps the poor I think the misconception may be that I think okay I think I think he's coming from himself back around that being in the domain of kofar for no reason like study or like like medical treatment you should have this one where you fight the kofar because they pay taxes the dealers are superficial they're really superficial no no because you can remember they said okay we're gonna fight America because there's a bit we've talked into the videos because they pay taxes and they're implicit that was you know do you remember back in the days whereas the the more consistent point is about retribution if they can make transgression against you return the transgression is a more consistent argument than say just because by virtue of the person paying taxes yeah I think that's where it might be yeah yeah no no no this is this is I think this is coming from State no he's not setup but I think it's probably maybe maybe these ideas or maybe he's just sitting with people of this persuasion I just want to say that we're living with a being with the kofar relying on the bridge and the default generation that uh I have nothing to do with anyone living with them so that their War their Lata and they misunderstood you cannot live with them but it's not correct that's that's a part of the Hadith to fight certain people and then they were Believers and then without this reliever not distinct so that Khaled to kill them and to to announce that they are most
**Answer:** The speaker is asking for clarification about the permissibility of living in countries hostile to Islam, particularly in the context of seeking economic opportunity. They are questioning the argument that living in such countries is inherently wrong due to the taxes paid to the government. 

## 7884.96s: Category:  Interpretation
**Question:** so the brother's concerned about paying taxes and all this kind of stuff look there's an area of permissibility between McGraw to recommend it or whatever it may be then you're not going to find it being taxes you don't you don't go to a country to pay attention the state The Authority force on you to pay taxes even now in Saudi Arabia pay taxes now if you believe that tax is not legitimate or the authorities limit then you are at Liberty not to pay but you are then and there is danger to in 20 years in prison take take your risk if you want I will not advise anyone to do that because you should not put yourself so that you go into prison for 20 years because you fail to pay taxes especially in capitalist country taxes are more important I was once joking with someone say if someone go to Buckingham Palace and sneak like this man who they found them as the next the bed of the queen uh that's like 15 years ago or 20 years ago if even if you go and rape the queen say I was in love and so on you get three years in prison but if you don't pay your taxes you get 20 years at this these people these entities here survival and tax money so they are forced anywhere else in Sweden also will pay taxes one second one second this will be the last statement because we're gonna I can't uh I have to entertain other people as well but look cordawi went as far as saying fighting in the military as Halal in a famous fatwa honestly I don't give a damn well I don't think anyone cares what the dog he says these government Scholars well you know we have the evidences and sorting this out we discussed in the research about about immigration citizenship and the right of self-determination the appendix about uh is appended to that research is clearly showing that those who are fighting with the kofar uh they are classified as of the Ayah but if they are with the kofar but they are aside and they don't fight and they hold the hand back then they have we have no right to fight them or kill them that's explained and this is just hand him if he knows Arabic he can take the Arabic version and the English one is I think it's still under polishing that's it yeah I mean look if we go into that I mean we have always definitely uh there's so many examples you know like it's burning to my mind I wanted to pistol with people so for example you had MCB and standing handing just you know like a dirty little gungan little rodent standing next to Tony Blair Yusuf bile up all these these Stooges these Bootleggers right next to Tony Blair on during the war on terror we can't use these people as would you it's Allah there's a messenger and these the rest of these guys can take a hike they're they're never going to be an authority at the end of the day this is the mentality of ours whereby oh so-and-so said it oh the holy people they just did they float they don't walk they float we must accept them let's make saju to them you know this kind of mentality just takes some bleach and bleach that out of your brain go for the evidence ask this any one of these Mr evidence what a historical evidence these guys they want to make a lot of they used to make a good point they want to have ijaza to make their own dinner they you know they always unless you're a jar but oh great you've got a job that can that can rubber stamp anything I want that's what they want so forget them just what's the evidence bring it on anyone who wants to discuss let them come bring their Scholars whatever it is you know I mean write it down come face to face really you know we're done with this kind of mentality of a p you know so and so said so so-and-so Chinese Whispers anyway Iqbal over to you bro
**Answer:** The speaker is addressing concerns about paying taxes to a hostile government, emphasizing that such a situation does not necessarily make living in that country impermissible. They also touch upon the issue of fighting in the military of such a country, arguing that it is not permissible, but also noting that it is not a simple issue.  

## 8108.06s: Category:  Interpretation
**Question:** I had a quick question related to an Ayah uh but before that I want to mention another incident as well which was related to it so in uh when results 1400 sahaba that command was specific to those 1400 it was not to all the Muslims so the Muslims and who were left in Mecca in Medina in Bahrain in abyssinia that command was not applicable to them so those 1400 sahaba when they refused to take off their Haram or when they hesitated essentially that was a kind of unanimous age matter they took to not uh apply that action however Salam rejected the original and he said this isn't valid because it went against this command now this action in Hunan that happened as well when he went back to his companion and he said that your brothers that they have regretted their they made a mistake now they want their women back now all of the sahaba on apparent it showed that they agreed to return back the women folk however again results for assalam seemed that he rejected that sort of uh I would send the Hadith later as I'm now driving somewhere he rejected that sort of apparent of the sahaba and he said let your leaders come to me to say which one of you actually agree whether you all agree or whether you don't so he still did not so what would you consider that to also be another example against the ejima that you know we cannot take it unless we are certain uh from that and the final bit that I wanted to mention is in regards to uh the tattoo um while I I actually don't agree with it but nonetheless every Hadith that contains rasula Islam's statement his actual or a statement because majority of the Hadith this matter or narrator true meaning people's understanding of how they understood the command they've narrated it so the Hadith that actually contains or apparently contains the statement of rasulullah all the pronouns are for ladies so it either says ha or it says so for that reason the question is would you agree that if we apply that to the men uh assuming those are Hadith that say we will have to do here which is again another bottle uh uh um
**Answer:** The speaker is asking about the issue of ijma (consensus) among the sahaba, citing examples where certain sahaba disagreed with the apparent consensus. They are specifically looking for the professor's view on whether these examples are indicative of a broader principle that we should not rely on ijma unless there is absolute certainty.

**Answer:** The speaker is pointing out that the verses discussed earlier, which primarily address the conflict between the Muslims and the disbelievers of Mecca, will be interpreted by some as applying to Muslim leaders who have become tyrannical. The speaker is reminding the professor of this point and asking for clarification.

**Question:** he mentioned some crucial things which uh we would say are groundbreaking right some extent about how this needs to be understood because we have from one extreme you have the um the the sound of jihadists and stuff like that laying this as the general basis that this is the um this is the general state that basically Allah broke the Covenant and you just go around killing everyone and that's Islam right now the other side is okay fine would they'll be quiet about those eyes right but then they'll say okay this Ayah is just applies to the profile not too deep more and all that kind of stuff the people that are placed in in power of us because you know even if the Western people put them in they're still overpowered you and all this ridiculous stuff right so we need to find the basis and what we'll find the what's up here is clear that what Jacob is saying is that Islam is not a religion which preaches uh uh mindless aggression it is one that preaches yeah it preaches and it has the principle of Justice right and establishing of God's law but if the people fight Us in that and don't let us live in peace then we have a right to defend ourselves that's the basic point the second point to know is for them is this right as for those people who are attempting to cement the um the position of the following which their own books now the thing is this is the final point we'll leave and this is a claim for those who will stay if you say your followers of Muhammad bin Abdullah how is this the case right that he himself votes from Ibraham saying that um and then you have this thing but then you will call your leaders interesting isn't it very interesting the point is there is a situation here where a lie has been placed that we are the guardians of the Salas and this thing is pushed by a Mindless repetition and shutdown alhamdulillah now we have uh brothers and other people who are exposing the lie and they have no response so what is their thing just to curse but what does this indicate always when you just spit out don't listen to him it means you have no argument it's the same with our brother this and this is a different level we're not accusing them of being problematic in their basis what we're accusing them on the other thing is we've had this thing like for example if it has his opinion on music or these kind of stuff right they will say okay we will dismiss it you won't only dismiss it but why is an argument dismissed it's only dismissed because you know you don't have a response to the argument from the analysis of the narration so what we say to everyone out there and inshallah can end on this is look we must have mean versus our principle we take it Allah we take this and we apply our understanding as best as we can to that if we are wrong come to us and show this show us what the previous caller said and criticize it and or join it or benefit from it yeah exactly we're not rejecting anything we're not starting from zero we know there's plenty of work has been done in the past and take as much of its own world as possible or flesh it out or expand it yeah yeah the thing is what what does what the statement is from everyone all we are asking is for our writers brothers and Muslims to say look come discuss with us yeah these doors are always open and then we look forward to many for future disastructures
**Answer:** The speaker is highlighting the need for a balanced understanding of the verses related to fighting, as they are often misrepresented by both extremists and those who wish to minimize their importance. They emphasize that Islam is a religion of peace and justice but that it also contains principles of self-defense when necessary.

##  Iran's Attacks on Israel 

**What is the current situation between Iran and Israel?** 
*Timestamp:* 11.759s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:*  The speaker outlines the recent attacks by Iran on Israeli targets. They emphasize the damage done by drones, missiles, and ballistic missiles and the disruption of Israeli defense systems. 

**How did Iran communicate its retaliation for the Israeli embassy attack?**
*Timestamp:* 30.56s
*Category:* Diplomacy
*Answer:* The head of the CIA, who was in Oman at the time, was contacted by Iran and informed that they would take retribution for the embassy attack. This backdoor diplomacy was necessary because open diplomacy had failed,  and the CIA head was chosen due to his diplomatic experience and ability to negotiate. Iran assured the CIA that they would not target American lives, but they would carry out a significant attack.

**What was the extent of the damage from Iranian drone attacks?**
*Timestamp:* 210.599s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  Despite initial claims of a 99.9% success rate in intercepting the drones, it has been revealed that the actual number is closer to 86%. Some drones were successful in penetrating Israeli defenses, exhausting their Iron Dome system and diverting attention.

**Why was it significant that Iranian cruise missiles were successful?** 
*Timestamp:* 262.12s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:* Cruise missiles were able to gather intelligence about Israeli defense facilities, exposing their location and mapping their defenses, including the types of radar systems they used. This intelligence could be crucial for future attacks.

**What is the significance of Israeli high-ranking personnel being injured in the attacks?**
*Timestamp:* 440.8s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  The Iranian attacks caused considerable damage to Israeli facilities, including the loss of high-ranking personnel.  These individuals, including engineers and skilled staff, are difficult to replace, resulting in a significant loss for the Israeli military.

**What is the significance of the alleged panic within the Israeli war cabinet?**
*Timestamp:* 480.28s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:*  Rumors suggest that the Israeli war cabinet was in a state of panic following the attacks. They are allegedly concerned that the public's faith in their ability to defend the country is shaken. This could lead to a mass exodus from Israel, as many might fear for their safety. 

**How much money did Israel spend on defense during the attacks?**
*Timestamp:* 541.6s
*Category:* Economy
*Answer:*  An estimated $1.5 billion to $3 billion was spent on Israeli defense during the 24 hours of Iranian attacks. This includes the cost of expensive missiles and planes, highlighting the financial strain on Israel.

**What is the impact of the American refusal to help refuel Israeli planes?**
*Timestamp:* 895.04s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:* The American refusal to refuel Israeli planes during the attacks limits their ability to reach Iranian targets. This significantly restricts the scope of any potential Israeli retaliation. 

**What was the purpose of the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities?**
*Timestamp:* 990.04s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:*   The Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which was initially portrayed as a significant blow, turned out to be a small-scale drone attack that caused minimal damage. This might have been a psychological warfare tactic, intended to project strength and deter Iran from future attacks.

**What is the significance of the Israeli withdrawal of troops from the Lebanese border?**
*Timestamp:* 1139.48s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  The Israeli withdrawal of troops from the Lebanese border, likely influenced by American pressure, indicates their reluctance to engage in a larger conflict with Lebanon. This may be due to the risk of a significant counterattack from Hezbollah, which has a vast arsenal of missiles, including supersonic and hypersonic ones.

**Why is it improbable that Israel will attack Iran?**
*Timestamp:* 1271.44s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  Israel is unlikely to attack Iran because they lack the necessary military capabilities to effectively target Iranian facilities. Their missile technology is inferior to Iran's, and they are not equipped to handle a potential counterattack that would be significantly stronger than the recent drone and missile attacks.

**How are Iranian leaders viewed?**
*Timestamp:* 1654.0s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The speaker criticizes Iranian leadership, accusing them of lacking faith in their own strength and relying too heavily on technology rather than the will to fight. They suggest that a change in Iranian leadership could be necessary to shift their approach.

**Why is the American involvement in the conflict a bluff?**
*Timestamp:* 1974.559s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The speaker argues that the American involvement in the conflict is a bluff. They cite previous examples where the US has backed down from military threats, including the Vietnam War and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

**What is the impact of the Palestinian Authority's request for statehood?**
*Timestamp:* 1985.519s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The Palestinian Authority's request for statehood at the UN was vetoed by the US. The speaker criticizes this action, calling it hypocritical considering the US claims to support the two-state solution. This has damaged the Palestinian Authority's legitimacy and weakened their position in negotiations. 

**How did the recent conflict expose the weaknesses of the Palestinian Authority?**
*Timestamp:* 2024.519s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The US veto of the Palestinian Authority's statehood request has exposed their weakness and dependence on US support.  Despite their claims of independence, they are still subject to American influence and unable to control the situation in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas.

**What is the likely outcome of the conflict?**
*Timestamp:* 2095.96s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The speaker believes that the conflict could escalate or de-escalate.  Within Iran, there are growing calls for a more aggressive response, including the possibility of using nuclear weapons.
