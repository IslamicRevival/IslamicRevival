The other possibility is that Israel is planning a devastating attack on Iran, possibly targeting key infrastructure and political figures.  The speaker, however, argues for a preemptive strike by Iran, targeting key Israeli infrastructure, as a defensive measure to prevent a larger attack.

## 107.439s:  Inheritance and the Quran 
**Is there a need to review the Quranic verses on inheritance?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that he initially did not think a review of the Quranic verses on inheritance was necessary. However, he encountered  deeper problems in inheritance calculations and discovered that there are two major schools of thought on this matter. He also mentions that there are variations and mistakes in these interpretations, and these need to be addressed.

## 143.92s:  Major Schools of Thought on Inheritance 
**What are the two major schools of thought on inheritance?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that there are two main schools of thought on inheritance law. One, followed by most Madhahib except Imami and Zahiri, is considered the more common school. The other school is attributed to Al-Bayt Ibn Abbas and is considered more reasonable and consistent with the Quran's text.

## 181.76s:  Inheritance and the Imami School 
**Which school of thought is adopted by the Imami Jafari School?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker indicates that the Imami Jafari School adopts the second school of thought, attributed to Al-Bayt Ibn Abbas. While he is uncertain if the Zahiri School also follows this approach, there is a high probability they do. He emphasizes the importance of discussing these issues on their own merit rather than focusing on which school adheres to them.

## 237.12s:  Inheritance: The Problem of Over-Subscription
**What is the main problem encountered in allocating inheritance portions?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker introduces the problem of over-subscription, where allocating all the designated shares for heirs leads to a total exceeding 100%. He uses the example of a woman who dies with a husband and two daughters. The husband is entitled to a quarter of the inheritance, while the daughters, according to the first ayah of inheritance, receive two-thirds. This creates a total of 125%, exceeding the total wealth.

## 325.84s:  Inheritance: Prioritization of Debts and Obligations
**How are debts and obligations prioritized in inheritance law?**

**The Speaker**:  The speaker explains the order of prioritization in inheritance law. First, debts and obligations are settled, including Zakat, loans, and funeral expenses. The funeral expenses must be paid according to the deceased person's status. After all debts and obligations are settled, the will is addressed.

## 383.759s:  Inheritance and Wills
**What are the restrictions on wills in inheritance law?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker clarifies that a will cannot exceed one-third of the deceased person's wealth. He also highlights that wills cannot include heirs' shares, as those are already designated by Allah. However, if a will mentions a non-heir who becomes an heir later due to the death of another person, the judge or lawyer needs to address this by deducting that portion from the will.

## 4595.12s:  Understanding the Final Ayah of Inheritance
**What is the essence of the final ayah of the inheritance chapter?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that the final ayah of the inheritance chapter addresses the case of someone dying without any children or parents. In such situations, the inheritance goes to brothers and sisters, with the male inheriting twice the share of the female. This ayah clarifies the rules for inheriting in the absence of direct heirs.

## 4872.32s:  Clarifying the Meaning of "The Unhappy Brother"
**What does the term "the unhappy brother" refer to in inheritance law?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker refers to a specific case often referred to as "the unhappy brother." This involves a deceased woman leaving a husband, a daughter, and a son of a son. The speaker challenges the traditional interpretation, where the son of the son inherits a sixth, potentially causing hardship for the daughter. He argues that this interpretation leads to over-subscription and proposes a different calculation that avoids this issue.

## 5416.96s:  Inheritance Laws for Non-Muslims
**Do inheritance laws apply differently if inheritors are non-Muslims?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker explains that, in general, Muslims cannot inherit from non-Muslims. He cites a dissenting view from the time of the Sahaba, arguing that Islam increases and is therefore superior. However, he considers this argument faulty,  highlighting the hadith of Salman which states that Muslims cannot inherit from non-Muslims and vice versa.

## 5693.28s:  Applying Islamic Inheritance Law in Non-Islamic Societies
**Can Islamic inheritance law be applied in non-Islamic societies?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker clarifies that applying Islamic inheritance law in non-Islamic societies requires creating a will that adheres to the local legal system. This would involve recording the inheritance distribution according to the specific laws of the country, such as in England, where wills are legally binding.

## 6424.32s:  Reading Between the Lines: Importance of Context
**Why is reading between the lines in Islamic texts crucial for understanding their nuances?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding context and reading between the lines in Islamic texts. He uses the example of a story about two women playing drums in the Prophet's presence to demonstrate how the meaning can be misinterpreted if the context is not considered. He highlights the potential for misunderstanding when people cling to isolated words or phrases without analyzing their context.

## 6833.599s:  The Importance of Comprehensive Quranic Analysis
**How crucial is a comprehensive analysis of the Quran for accurate understanding?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker stresses the necessity of comprehensive Quranic analysis. He criticizes the common practice of interpreting isolated phrases or ayahs without considering the context of the entire surah or even related surahs. He argues that this fragmented approach leads to misunderstanding and confusion. 

## 6910.96s:  Challenging Misinterpretations of Islamic Texts
**What is the speaker's goal in addressing these misinterpretations?**

**The Speaker**: The speaker acknowledges that the field of Islamic scholarship needs a major overhaul to address the misinterpretations that have plagued it. He emphasizes the need for consistent analysis and interpretation, based on the Quran and Sunnah, to ensure that people can truly benefit from these texts. 


## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byeVr9SWZZU

##  The Speaker asks: At the beginning, we waited for the first speech of Hass, it was unfortunate the way he formulated it and we at that time already stated that he said if we are attacked in Lebanon, and we said the word "attack" in Lebanon is a catastrophe; it turned out to be a catastrophe; it seems that there were many indications that he was forced by Iran to do that out of wisdom.  
**Category:**  Political Analysis

The speaker suggests that Hassan Nasrallah was forced by Iran to make a statement regarding a potential attack on Lebanon. This statement was seen as a weakness and contributed to the current situation. The speaker believes Nasrallah's comments were ultimately detrimental to Hezbollah's position.

Don't be fooled by all this baloney; Israel is rebelling against it.

**Category:** Political Conspiracy 

The speaker claims that US President Biden gave Israel a direct order to completely annihilate Hezbollah during a 6-hour meeting. The speaker suggests that this order was recorded and that if the US does not comply, the evidence will be released to the world, leading to Biden's downfall. 

## The Speaker asks:  Independent of that, true or not, that occasion was missed. They could have taken the occasion and say, "Listen, we require the application of the order of the World Court within maybe a week, two weeks, one month, a reasonable time, otherwise, we will regard ourselves as at liberty to retaliate against Israeli citizens, or something like that."
**Category:** Political Strategy

The speaker argues that Hezbollah missed an opportunity to leverage the International Court of Justice's ruling on genocide by not issuing a clear ultimatum to Israel, threatening retaliation if their orders were not followed within a specific timeframe. This, the speaker believes, would have been a strong and effective deterrent.

## The Speaker asks: There was the assassination of -- they missed that. But just attack, and the rumors is that the current appointee for the leadership -- already appointed -- maybe I'm not sure if he's formally appointed and announced as such, uh Sheik Hashim --  advised that say we have to we should do but wanted to hedge the position and be more in the soft side because certain considerations which may be is is a phy the consideration is that this way will prevent an attack against Lebanon.
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker claims that the new Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hashim, is taking a more cautious approach, seeking to avoid provoking Israel. He argues that this strategy is a mistake, as Israel's attack on Lebanon is inevitable. The speaker believes that a more proactive strategy is necessary to prevent further harm.

## The Speaker asks: But that's a mistake because the attack against Lebanon is in was inevitably coming if you see the reality, but when they finish with they will you by destroying you, you should not have get them the opportunity to breathe and organize himself and at that time you would have the initiative of so they missed that other occasion.
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker argues that Hezbollah should have taken a more aggressive stance against Israel and launched an attack rather than waiting for Israel to strike first. The speaker believes that by allowing Israel to dictate the terms of engagement, Hezbollah has placed itself in a vulnerable position. 

## The Speaker asks:  Now we'll see if they don't miss it, or don't miss it because now there's nothing of missing. Just few hours ago, I think the Israelis started the invasion, the land invasion in Lebanon, and they will continue until they defeated. There's no escape now. They have to fight for their life. Obviously, we pray pray to hope that they will ultimately end Victorious, but there's no, inevitably, the first phase will be massive against hisb. There will be plenty of Bloodshed, tens of thousands. 
**Category:** Military Situation

The speaker confirms that Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, escalating the conflict. The speaker acknowledges the gravity of the situation, expecting heavy casualties on both sides. The speaker remains hopeful for Hezbollah's victory but emphasizes that the fighting will be brutal and costly.

## The Speaker asks: I don't think only thousand 1,600, it's a dream if someone thinks 1,600. All the will be killed from civilian, then he doesn't know what is and America all about. We will end maybe with 20, 30,000 kill yes, or even maybe more, is a is real calamity, which shows the mistake of not taking the initiative and not seeing that all the American action was to give Israel time to finish Gaza and then turn to the and think that even if they even the facts now Pro that even if they cannot finish but I just keep it under siege, right, so that they can withdraw some forces, they will attack Lebanon anyway.
**Category:** Military Analysis

The speaker predicts that the conflict will result in a high number of casualties, likely exceeding 1,600 and reaching as high as 20,000 or 30,000. The speaker blames Hezbollah's failure to take initiative for this tragic outcome, suggesting that the US deliberately allowed Israel to conquer Gaza before shifting focus to Lebanon. 

## The Speaker asks: Now, I argue, just let me do the argument and come to comment about IR. That it's almost certain that Iran will be attacked whatever they do, if they do anything or do nothing, the attack is almost inevitably coming. There are rumors from some people who seem to be deep inside the Saudi regime, and others, that the plans and the targets are already fixed, and assisted for that bombers in R Garcia and the gulf, and so are ready for that. 
**Category:** Military Forecast 

The speaker argues that Iran is likely to be attacked by Saudi Arabia regardless of their actions. This attack is reportedly planned, with targets already selected, and bombers deployed in readiness. The speaker cites sources within the Saudi regime to support this claim. 

## The Speaker asks:  They are ready for that. Additionally, the recent behavior of Iran encouraged them to see that Iran are cowed or afraid, and they're hedging and they want to get away. The moment you, the enemy, sees that you are afraid, and you want to get away, the sheep say that's the time to smash the other one, otherwise, we don't get that point, any other time. 
**Category:** Military Psychology

The speaker believes that Iran's recent hesitant behavior has emboldened Saudi Arabia to attack. The speaker uses the analogy of a predator recognizing weakness in prey, suggesting that Iran's fear and desire to avoid conflict make them vulnerable to an attack.

## The Speaker asks:  So recently, uh, with the recent event, uh, this new president, M Khan, his but his name pronounced will be pronounced, he said, we did not take revenge for because the American promised family that within a week they will have a ceasefire negotiated, and uh and then would seize the activity, and we think this is a good, and also, I think he said that, or some other people exposed it, they promise to cancel a good good amount of sanctions, cancel sanctions, is a good target also, is not is not a betrayal to to not take revenge in return of sanction and and seize fire, this is a good price. 
**Category:** Political Negotiation

The speaker discusses the Iranian government's decision not to retaliate for US sanctions and instead accept a ceasefire agreement. The speaker argues that this was a good decision, citing the promise of sanctions relief as a reasonable trade-off for forgoing immediate revenge.  

## The Speaker asks: There's no problem with that, but the problem is that one week pass, nothing, and we, two pass, you should have a secret deadline. You promise within one week, okay. One week may not work. Two weeks, next week, we will retaliate. There's no question, we're not going to accept your claims and your promises now. This himself say, this turns out to be all complete lies. 
**Category:** Political Criticism 

The speaker expresses frustration with the US's failure to follow through on promised sanctions relief and a ceasefire agreement. The speaker criticizes the US for lying and breaking their promises, arguing that this behavior has undermined trust and necessitates a stronger response.

## The Speaker asks: This shows that at least he is a simpleton, and a Gable idiot, at least if not a traitor, because until now, now he's not moving in the right direction to the tune that Iranian people, now minority, were demonstrating in at the at the site of the the building of the National Security Council, demanding that the the instruction of Kamai, which seems to be they are aware about that, to take retaliation should be executed, and they are threatening badan and his Deputy zarif, no Zar is American agent, he's not a symbol idiot, an American agent.
**Category:** Political Discord

The speaker suggests that the Iranian president is either incompetent or a traitor, failing to act on the demands of the Iranian people to retaliate against the US. The speaker also accuses the Iranian foreign minister of being a US agent, highlighting the deep divisions within the Iranian leadership. 

## The Speaker asks: And also, it seems to be that Iranian think the situation is serious, and the possibility of assassination is on is is really on the table, so they they moved Kamai to undisclosed place. No, so the situation is very critical now. 
**Category:** Political Instability 

The speaker describes a tense and potentially volatile situation in Iran. The speaker suggests that the Iranian government is taking precautions to protect key figures, including moving officials to undisclosed locations, due to fears of assassination. The speaker highlights the seriousness of the situation. 

## The Speaker asks: Still, there's there's a possibility that this idiot, if he's an idiot, not a traitor, that he may think not taking a retaliation and not supporting hisbah will save Iran. He's mistaken. The attack with is coming in. 
**Category:** Political Miscalculation

The speaker believes that the Iranian president is making a critical miscalculation by avoiding retaliation, believing it will prevent an attack. The speaker insists that the attack is inevitable and that Iran's inaction will only weaken their position. 

## The Speaker asks: And there's also rumor going on. I think it's not a rumor, a piece of news really, that is threatened America, threatened Iran. We will strike you if if you come to support, attack us, we will strike you. Threatening really, flexing the muscle. 
**Category:** Military Threat

The speaker reports that the US has directly threatened Iran with retaliation if they support Hezbollah's actions. The speaker describes this as a clear flexing of military power and an attempt to deter Iranian involvement.

## The Speaker asks: The point which is yeah, if the is threat is seriously be taken and they are they sufficient blood thirsty to be expected to do worse things fine. But the problem is not to see that the suggest to get the opportunity to finish as they believe they would be able and then they will strike. And if they don't succeed even finishing but slim it down and push it a little bit back and get the breathing opportunity, they will attack Iran. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker warns that the US is willing to take drastic measures against Iran. The speaker emphasizes that the US intends to maximize its gains and is willing to strike even if a complete victory is not achieved.  

## The Speaker asks: And there even rumors that even the United States of America already have finished their plans and so on, and they will take the opportunity to settle that, not for for them. So it will it is a high time that that the Irani leadership recognizes that it's now the matter of the attack is coming inevitably since it's coming almost inevitably or inevitably, then you have to benefit from situation to take the initiative, because if you take the initiative you can harm the enemy. 
**Category:** Political Action

The speaker emphasizes the urgency of the situation, stating that an attack on Iran is almost certain and that the Iranian government needs to take a decisive and proactive approach to defend themselves. The speaker believes that a preemptive strike is the best strategy.

## The Speaker asks: I would have taken someone was suggesting to me maybe then bombing the American bases in the G. That's a mistake, no, not bombing. Taking the initiative, meaning doing a good solid attack in against the building of the parliament, against the Mad headquarter, against the ministry of defense, against the Council of Ministers, please, the house of Netanyahu, all of these things, plus some other strategic targets, 40 50 hypersonics which Iran has, that's worth obviously supported other missiles ahead of them to satate that iron doome, but seems the iron doome is it's clearly showing failure with this isra will be having no no no other option except to to attack. 
**Category:** Military Tactics

The speaker suggests that Iran should launch a counterattack, not against US bases, but against Israeli targets. The speaker recommends a series of attacks against key Israeli government buildings and military installations using hypersonic missiles. 

## The Speaker asks: But then, we we'll see if the America start participating or there's any sign that the bases in the gulf and so on are are being used then Iran is watching the situation they initi in our hand they're looking what's going on and they can't bomb these then immediately just the next hour few hours later. So that's that the way it will go meanwhile also beside the attack inside side from from Iran itself, the resistance in Iraq should be giving a leeway and more more capability to attack the American bases in Iraq and Syria massively. 
**Category:** Military Coordination 

The speaker believes that Iran should take advantage of the US's potential involvement in the conflict and target US bases in the Gulf region immediately. Additionally, the speaker suggests that Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria should simultaneously launch attacks against US bases in those countries.

## The Speaker asks:  An attack of anation of Slaughter this way the American attack, which will come definitely, America has enough his assets, even if they b a bomb Z, they have still the day of gar they have other places, and they will do damage, it they will kill, but it will be my milder than without would be much milder than if they start. But if they start, they have the initiative; they can shoot targets, but now you will be in high El, you will be stand by, you do the strike against the Pres Iraq, will work on the long run, they they should be tell told or encouraged to tr all ride all American bases in Iraq and Syria as a Target as you because you are an independent over force, and if the Iraqi must come in the way then put them at build the sword stop them. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker argues that Iran and its allies should proactively launch a counterattack against US bases in the region. The speaker believes that a preemptive strike would minimize potential damage from a US retaliation and create a stronger defensive position.

## The Speaker asks: But we as a state we have to go follow certain procedures, which are dictated by international attack against is, or that what they did to, but positive, strong solid one, forcing the other side if they want to attack, or they to attack, they should execute that's it. 
**Category:** International Relations 

The speaker acknowledges that Iran must operate within international rules and procedures while still taking a decisive stance against US and Israeli aggression. The speaker emphasizes that Iran should not hesitate to retaliate if they face an attack. 

## The Speaker asks: So that's that's the way it works so that's it, but taking all evidences I think the the soal Deep State, or the the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Min of Defense, the all the administration, so on, is really deeply penetrated by the so-called what they call the Baha faction. There's a Baha faction, they control the Deep State, and it's on the Revolutionary God Islam, reary God to tell them this not allow to get away with this, if necessary, we'll take m in our hand by if necessary, you have to execute the orders of and you have to take a stand because you are endangering Iran and weakening it. 
**Category:** Political Conspiracy

The speaker alleges that the Iranian government is infiltrated by a "Baha faction" that controls the Deep State and is acting against the interests of the Islamic Republic. The speaker calls on religious authorities to intervene and prevent this faction from further weakening Iran. 

## The Speaker asks: You are not strengthening it, you think you are saving the people from and from the campaign, but is has shown clearly, they are the one who will start the genocide and destruction, and they will not rest until they attack ir. 
**Category:** Political Warning 

The speaker warns that the Iranian government's inaction is actually strengthening the US and Israel, setting the stage for a devastating attack on Iran. The speaker suggests that the government's inaction will ultimately lead to further suffering for the Iranian people. 

## The Speaker asks: And possibly, if we do it the correct way, the Americans will not have motivation to participate, and they may be terrified, because I think until now, I'm insisting, what the Americans are saying, the muscle flexing is a bluff, and the threats are above because there's no way they can succeed in anything substantially without nuclear weapons or without land invasion, which is impossible. Land invasion needs six months at least preparation, and question, where they should have their forces before the invasion in the Gulf, they will be attacked before that, next day, they'll be attacked. 
**Category:** Military Analysis

The speaker believes that US threats are hollow and that they lack the capacity to launch a successful attack on Iran without resorting to nuclear weapons or a lengthy ground invasion, both of which are highly unlikely. The speaker believes that the US is bluffing and that Iran should stand firm. 

## The Speaker asks: I don't think Iran, anybody in IR, is so stupid like Sadam, who let the Americans accommodate their forces, and so on, thinking that he can negotiate his way out of qu, instead of taking the all the east of Saudi Arabia and forcing the Americans to treat and say, okay, I give you that back, you go out and leave qu with me. 
**Category:** Historical Analysis

The speaker compares the current situation to Iraq under Saddam Hussein, arguing that Saddam's fatal mistake was allowing the US to build up its forces before launching a counterattack. The speaker suggests that Iran should learn from this history and take preemptive action. 

## The Speaker asks: He would have succeeded Almost 100%, and prevented even the accommodation of forces if you took the Eastern region of Saudi Arab if he has taken that 30 35 33 years ago, that who they would land in n, then they have to cross the desert which is almost, but he he failed to do that because he's dumb and stupid, and Allah has forsaken him, did not open his ey give him guidance, but I think the people in Iran are much more intelligent than that, and they should see, they should learn them from history. 
**Category:** Historical Lesson

The speaker argues that Iran is more capable than Saddam Hussein and should learn from his mistakes. The speaker believes that a more proactive strategy is crucial to prevent the US from gaining a foothold in the region. 

## The Speaker asks: The history is clear, you can't kick the American, but did it the did it, and you can't do better than that, but take the initiative and don't let the first strike come because the first strike will cause you much more blood than if you take the initiative. 
**Category:** Strategic Decision

The speaker urges Iran to take a proactive stance and launch a counterattack to minimize the damage that would result from a US or Israeli strike. The speaker acknowledges the inevitable bloodshed but believes that Iran will suffer more if they remain passive. 

## The Speaker asks: But blood will be shed, and it will be you are willing or you unwilling, so that's it, concerning it seems to be if it's true that Hashim saf is appointed, all indication that he's stronger, more devoted to fight, willing to attack T aib and U uh much more strict, and more some people say even bloodthirsty, or vicious, or or Reckless, or something like that.

## The Speaker asks: It's a welcome Reckless that's not recklessness, that's the right course of action, recklessness is that to start an attack and provoking a counter-attack, which would unconceivable, it will come, but counter-attack or the attack of is is on the plan for many years. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

The speaker defines true recklessness as provoking a counter-attack by launching an attack first, which would be detrimental. The speaker considers a preemptive counter-attack as the correct course of action, given that an attack from Israel is inevitable. 

## The Speaker asks: The P Affair show that they're working that in 15 years, these guys are working to an and theate Muslim of Palestine, when they will not seize and do it because they know if they don't do that they will disappear from the from the from the map. That's the only way they can survive for them is matter of life and death so you have to work on that level also for you, it should be a matter of life and death.
**Category:** Political Motivation

The speaker suggests that Israel's aggression stems from a desperation for survival, as they believe they will be wiped off the map if they do not act decisively against their enemies. The speaker calls for a similar level of resolve and commitment from Iran and its allies.

## The Speaker asks: So that's it, is the situation desperate or hopeless, like many people are now shaken, and many of the rats filthy rats coming from the hole, and filthy swine coming and and snorting and so on. Some of them under the B of sism, somebody of the national interest, some that that no, is not like that.

This is a very nice Channel, and the people doing analysis uh are very qualified, and the majority of them are not just realist, have moral values, but alista crook is really well about Lebanon and the Middle East, I think since the '90s and he was involved in negotiations, maybe he originally he was Intelligence services, my6 or something like that, and his analysis is as objective as you can get from anyone from the West, actually someone would say he's slightly positive inclined toward hisbah and admiring and respecting which is good.

**Answer:** The speaker criticizes the recent Iranian attack on Israel as weak and symbolic. The speaker also notes the significant expense for Israel and the US to intercept the drones, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of drones over more traditional weaponry.

## 1058.28s: ... I think that was a mistake, it was a mistake to do that, because if you beat the general prin, say, if you must beat, then you be T, so the other sign recognize that you are serious, that was interpreted wrongly, obviously, at that moment, they spend it, that it's ineffective, it doesn't mean anything and so on, and America sold this, this, this um, uh, media campaign as, as if present itself to, to, to the Iranian, that we are mediating, we don't want the warri to spread, and we are the one who are restrain the, I think, the later events have shown that they are lying, it's only Tri, it's already SE to move to give themselves time for preparation, evidence after that more planes and more tanking planes came to the area, putting the stage for whatever action needed down the road, then there was the assassination of RI which Iran covered up and claimed is technical, I don't believe it's a techn, I think it's is behind that, I almost certain about that, obviously, I cannot make an oath on that because I don't know, but it's almost certain that it's behind that, but the Iranian were, were really embarrassed and forced to, to, just if, if they announce that is behind that they would have been obliged to do something, massive action, but they still chicken out, especially this new pres turns out to be either an extremely appeaser of a maaf, or he is such a Gable symbol to thece, which has been shown later to be one most like the first one, if we have, if we give him some good credit, he just, just blatant idiot, even pep escopa, the famous Brazilian journalist who is following the war in Ukraine, the situation in the, in the Far East for now, for almost three decades, said everyone is shocked about the Simplicity and naivity of this man in the United Nation meeting recently.

The speaker also accuses Israel of assassinating an Iranian official and criticizes the Iranian leadership for being weak and cowardly.

## 1184.6s:  ... so Israel took more Liberty and the assassinating in, in, in, in the celebration for the inauguration of the new president and, U, that's uh, that obviously put on the spot, they must take revenge and they say they will take, but then this Gible man, this M, whatever his name, uh, believe that the American trickery because the American promised him that within one week, we have a cheese fire, and he thought right, we saw the idea itself for that will be good enough to, for, for, for the, uh, uh, the retaliation, ending the war, there, my ceasefire that would have been a good price, no problem, no, no issue with that, but the problem is that to believe that the Americans are serious in their effort, and they are not deceptive, and they are good intending, and seem to, he repeated that in the United Nation attend, so this man is dangerous, we have to watch him carefully and the Irani have to watch him carefully, and I think they're watching him now carefully, and there was a demonstration against, we'll come to that also, so one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks until eight weeks, it was clear that and then, even until, until the United, United Nation session in which during the his stay there Netanyahu gave a very arrogant bico speech insulting everyone in the world showing such an arrogance, which is unbelievable, and during his stay there, he gave the order to assassinate, so then was clear that Iran must respond, and then were demonstrations going on in Iran, and I think the demonstration is, I think, it's spontaneous by the people, but definitely, the, the IRG, the, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is, is pushing that for, and so on, there's R, almost that they, that also the was outraged, and all of these things whatever, these reports cannot be trusted 100%, because I have the feeling that Kamai is more, and the camp, and the Gbel, or the cowed camp of, of badan, but the days will show that it will come, all that will be shown, and they did the action of last week's Tuesday now the action of last week's Tuesday, U, was all in all, a solid good action, solid action, however, again it was relatively measured, yes, there was no civilian Target, I think this, I was what I would say it was good not to Target any restrict on Military, but uh, and military and security targs, I would have if I were in their place, I would have made all air, air Bas as a Target, have more hypersonics, and Ballistic, uh, the ballistic were usually used mostly because the accuracy is accuracy, accuracy is slightly less than the Hypersonic, but they mo used mostly to, to get the Aros system and, uh, David thinging and the, and, and iron doome, iron doome is ineffective in that iron doome is really for slow rockets, for Dron things like that, while the David sling is essentially the equivalent of the, of the, of the p system is for, for faster objects, and then the arrows really for Hypersonic and, and Ballistic, the, the problem with the ballistic is that they because of they high Target, they can be seen far away, and speed, they personic has spe, but because their target, their, their, their trajectory is, is relying on bistic, it shoots high, and then it falls down with by the falling, it gains speed, and when it hits, it is with hypers sonic speed, yes, but the problem in the high point, it is visible far away, because the high point could be like 1,200 kilom up, and this is easily visible from 3, 4,000, so the moment you shoot them from Iran, the moment they go up there, they say, when they high above Iraq, they are watched and followed by the radar and the continue watching them calculating their trajectory seeing what and then calculate ious interception points, when they enter the atmosphere or before the atmosphere, that's, that's, that's the theory while the Hypersonic flly just above the atmosphere or inside the atmosphere in such a way that they become visible very close just one minute, half a minute, and this very difficult to calculate a trajectory and reception point, so the ballistics were mostly used to, to engage the Aros system. 
**Category:** Military Strategy

**Answer:** The speaker analyzes the recent Iranian attack on Israel, praising it for being a "solid action" but critiquing its limited scope and effectiveness. The speaker suggests that Iran should have targeted Israeli military facilities with hypersonic missiles, noting the limitations of ballistic missiles in terms of visibility and interception.

## 1496.72s:  ... but see, even the AR system fail because in some places we saw almost 20 hits, like in this famous base which has been hammered nicely, uh, the majority, and the accuracy is not that seems to be that, they use something just as essentially to work as a decoy, but to do some damage, and, and, and, and, and does some explosive damage, but it seems to be the model they used is not the top accuracy because none of these seems to be the hitting the relevant building and, and, and ters, and things like that, while the hypersonics, all of them had the target almost precisely, so this have to be also understood and learned for the future, um, this, the hyponic, maybe in total, about 30, or something like that, while the rest is the, the ballistic, who were really intended mostly as a decoy, but they lose some damage when go through, and they hit also the, the, the Mad Head water in their place, I would have made the number much bigger, that's number one, that's the, the one point, the number much bigger, all airports, but also, I would have hmer the ministry of Defense which has a considerable compound, but it's a ESS a main building, double attack against thead headquarters, small attack, symbolic attack, or something, that maybe with a ballistic against Netanyahu's house, I know he's not there, I know we know he's in a banker, but doesn't matter, it's symbolic, and also the, the parliament, so to see that your political targets, you, you're attacked, supreme leader of a movement, which is equivalent to a head state, if that was a state, then similar facilities would be attack without mercy, and then the, other, uh, also they targeted important, one of the best, strongest, and farest reing Radars, one of the strongest in the world, one of the best America produced, and this seems to be T been demolished completely, so meaning the next attack the Aros system does not have the eye which looks far away, or one the most important eye which can detect the CR a bird and distance of 3,000 kilometers, so that's gone, that's finished, that's it's confirm these days, I think today it is confir, that's gone, so the head is good, but good have been stronger, much stronger, and, uh, giving a stronger message, that's I agree with that with mcregor, McGregor, he doesn't agree with the whole say, this is a set by the is, but say, independent of that, if you decided to do it, ignore it is a, or not, because you may share his point to be it's a, to withdraw to get you into trouble, and get the American get in, or something that let's assume is right or wrong, it doesn't matter, say, but the moment you decide to do it, the way they did it is too, too weak to give the necessary message, and I think he's right, this Con McGregor, who has his own program as appear judge Napolitan and other programs, and also is very frequently interviewed by George G in the mother of all talk shows, uh, so that's right, it should have been St up, and the issue then the communic is also interesting, the communic says in, in, in support for the heroic fight of Gaza and so on, so they mention Gaza, support for Gaza, secondly, in, in retaliation, I think it was the third one, I don't know what's the order and then in, in retaliation for the association of, and, and also in support for the people of Lebanon, because leanon they started hammering Lebanon, the dation of was connected with a severe huming of the uh, south subab of B, so that hints that these three areas will be taken into consideration for any future action, but it was not uh, but it was not said directly, and if you repeat your attack again, if you retaliate, if you respond to this attack, we will respond with much stronger atts, that's good, but responding to attack could be in various ways, obviously, when you read it at faces respond to the attack by attacking us at home, Iran, I would, if I were there, I would have said, if you respond to the attack, even by increasing the bombing of Gaza or continuing the bombing of the then we regard that as a response and become stronger, unfortunately, that was not formulated, and thus, the opportunity was going to make that clear and obvious, obviously, the usual spin, like in the that's the of October attack, they SP, like in the 4 of April, it was ineffective, and then some of the barking dogs or, or electronic flies of Saudi Arabia, andir oh, the, the WarHeads were just, were just empty there, was no WarHeads, the whole was a piece of theater, and the usual blubbery of, of crus the agents like Saudi Arabia, and so on, but that's all has been now refuted, and, uh, uh, it is really under claim, there's nothing has happened, most are intercepted or fell as usual, all rockets are usually either intercepted or fall in and populated an open area which is, has been proven 100% to be 100% Li, such lies that, and they still repeating it, maybe they want to convince themselves that they are getting away whatever it is, so that, uh, that that strike was good, was good, was solid, but is not the most solid one which would have the thir future, now after that again America came forward with the usual game of that, uh, but now in another language, that's, we, we advise is against attack the nuclear facilities, and then when Iran responded to the ISIS that they may attack the oil facilities and so on, that we will destroy all fac, all o facility from Aan all the way to, uh, to UA, they mention all the countries, the only exception was it was not mentioned by name, all other, including Iraq, Aan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, emirat bahin, but not mentioning of K which is significant, so that's, that's, that's what happened, and now we now back and forth attack, said no don't attack, we'll attack this, we don't attack this, as I said, we will respond strongly now, the ongoing discussion now is the following, what will happen, it seems to be Israel has no other option at the moment at least, Netanyahu at least for himself, but also, the, the public there because seem to be even, even soall liberals and so on, they say this is one lifetime opportunity to strike the nule program, uh, some of Dooms there are in America like Lind Graham and others say, we, we must help Israel attacking the nuclear program, this opport to take it out, etc, etc, the government say, we advise them against that, but we don't have no control over the action, that's what Biden said, and he had a very weak interview recently, he's wavering, nothing clear, is my feeling is that this is all, U, deceptive, uh, because meanwhile, and even before that, and meanwhile, more tanker and more fighter JS are sent to the area, so it's clearly something is being now prepared and ready for a possible stage, so, so uh, it seems to be that, uh, strike is coming, maybe would be stage right now, when we are talking, but most, most likely it's either tomorrow, the anniversary, the one year anniversary of the, of, the, of the 7th of October, will be tomorrow or it may be delayed for maximum, if it is ever delayed, uh, not after the election, before the election, like five to ten days, and it will be then, if it happen, either tomorrow or in five to ten days, most likely it is uh, to also to have some benefit for Biden, and, because it seems to be now almost clear that CA Harris winning is, is very remote is quite remote, unlikely, so they have to do something, and the assassination of Trump has not worked, and secondly, an attempt to do that now will lead to a civil war, so that's not the way to go, so the only way is to make the government sure that they are wise, they're managing the worldly Affair as it should be, and they, they can lead the country in a state, in a situation of war and for that, the best will be, for their point of view, the Twisted point of view, is to be engaging into Rob Strong action against Iran, and in that case, ISE, it, it would be most likely to take out so-called nuclear facilities, that, that's, that's, that's the strongest possibility, it could be all of it, it could be just, just deceptive, but it is, it does not seem that Israel can, can leave that aside, because they, they have failed in R, they strategically defeated, and now the Hamas and the other mujah and Jihad and so are starting the counterattacks against the Narin, nazarin Corridor, uh, RAF uh, the Philadelphia strip would be soon attacks would be starting there, and the daily we have ten, twenty injured and killed and so on, one tank, one machine taken, so it is going back as if we are starting 7th of October again, so that's, that's, there's no success here, at, at the Lebanese border, it seems to be Israel is, has failed until now, they admitted until that was sixty kill, and 100, something injured they live, just that, and they even announce names, and they have a funeral procession and all of these things, but I guess there are other sources claiming it, it's actually more closer to ten, full, that closer to

The speaker is asking for concrete examples of how Saudi Arabia has committed open kufr. They are looking for evidence from any source, including documents, personal accounts, or even just a list of actions taken by the Saudi government. They mention some examples, such as the presence of US military bases on Saudi land, the alliance of Saudi Arabia with non-Muslim countries against other Muslims, and the use of interest-based transactions (riba) in international trade. The speaker emphasizes that even within Saudi Arabia, the government allows and promotes riba through its banking system.

**Category:** Hadith Classification

**07.639s:** The speaker is asking what it means when a Hadith is described as "Hassan" after being relayed.

1. **Outwardly acceptable:** The isnād (chain of narrators) has a narrator whose trustworthiness is not yet confirmed, but who is not known for making mistakes or lying. 
2. **Famous for veracity:** The narrator is known for honesty, but not as reliable as a narrator of "Sahih" (authentic) hadiths.

2. **Those who reject "Hassan" Hadith:** They believe that only "Sahih" (authentic) Hadith should be used. 
3. **Those who do not accept "Hassan" Hadith but do accept "Sahih"**

This aligns with the general understanding of "Hassan" as being a strong, but not perfect, Hadith.

1. **No narrators accused of falsehood:**  The isnād must be free of known liars or unreliable narrators. 
2. **Not anomalous:** The Hadith must be consistent with other similar reports and not stand alone as an outlier.
3. **Multiple chains:**  The Hadith must have similar reports from more than one line of transmission, strengthening its credibility.

##  How to Identify True Prophecies 

**0:40.219s :  ** What are the conditions that must be met for a prophecy to be considered authentic? 
*Category: Prophecy Evaluation*

**Answer:**  For a prophecy to be considered authentic, three conditions must be met:

1. **Pre-Existing Documentation:** The prophecy must be documented before the event it predicts. 
2. **Genuine Prophecy:** The prophecy should be specific and structured, including names, places, and events. 
3. **Independent Fulfillment:** The fulfillment of the prophecy should not be influenced by the prophet or their followers. This avoids self-fulfilling prophecies.

*Category:  Quranic Prophecy*

While the Quran was compiled after this prophecy, the historical context and other evidence support the claim that the prophecy was genuine.

##  Is there any evidence that the Quran was initially revealed in written form?

**Category:** Quranic Revelation

The speaker states that the Quran is a written revelation, citing several narrations that support this claim. He points to the first revelation where the Angel Gabriel showed the Prophet Muhammad a parchment or scroll with writing on it and asked him to read, but he replied that he could not read.  The speaker also argues that the Quran's wording, particularly the phrase "in a protected tablet," further suggests a written form. He believes the evidence for a written revelation is clear and unambiguous. 

## Why was the Quran written without any dots on the letters?

**Category:** Quranic Script

The speaker discusses the absence of dots on the letters in early Quranic manuscripts and the debate surrounding it. He refutes the claim that the Arabic language did not have dots at the time, presenting two pieces of evidence: a rock inscription praising Umar ibn al-Khattab that clearly includes dots on the letters, and a document written in Arabic with dots that was found in Egypt. He concludes that the Arabic language did have dots, and the absence of them in early manuscripts is a deliberate choice, possibly for the following reasons:

- **To allow for multiple readings:**  The speaker argues that the absence of dots allows for different readings, especially in cases where words could have multiple meanings. He believes this allows for a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of the Quran's message. 
- **To emphasize the miraculous nature of the Quran:** The speaker suggests that the omission of dots is a testament to the Quran's divine nature, implying a divinely intended ambiguity that allows for various interpretations while remaining consistent with the meaning. 

## What is the significance of the first person who dotted the Quran? 

**Category:** Quranic Script

The speaker touches upon the debate surrounding the first person to dot the Quran and the significance of the practice. He theorizes that the dotting system might have been adopted from Hebrew, which uses dots for the short vowels that Arabic lacks.  He suggests that the dotting may have been introduced by a Jewish scholar who converted to Islam, possibly to aid in the correct pronunciation of the Quran for those who were not fluent in Arabic. 

He also discusses a possible later adoption of the dotting system, possibly during the time of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, with the purpose of clarifying the text and avoiding confusion with other Arabic letters that share the same shape but have different meanings. He states that this adoption was likely influenced by the Hebrew system and was a natural progression for a language closely related to Arabic.

## What is the proper way to count the Quranic verses, particularly with regard to the Basmala? 

**Category:** Quranic Counting

The speaker emphasizes the need for a consistent system for counting Quranic verses, particularly regarding the Basmala (the opening phrase "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"). He argues that the Basmala should be considered a separate verse, despite being a recurring phrase, because it's considered part of the Quran as a whole.

He states that the correct count for the Quran should be 114 chapters and 6236 verses, with the Basmala being considered the zeroth verse of each chapter. He rejects other counting systems that include the Basmala as part of the verse count of each chapter, stating that this leads to inconsistencies and misinterpretations. 

## What are the seven readings of the Quran, and how do they affect our understanding of the text?

**Category:** Quranic Readings

The speaker touches upon the seven readings of the Quran, stating that they are primarily related to differences in pronunciation and recitation styles, rather than significant changes in meaning.  He suggests that these variations are permissible and don't constitute separate Quranic texts, but rather different ways of reciting the same text. 

He mentions that these readings are often attributed to seven specific Imams, who received their knowledge from various sources. However, the speaker raises doubts about the consistency and reliability of their methodologies, arguing that a more in-depth study is necessary to determine the accuracy and validity of these readings. 

## What should we do about the claims of Imran Hussein regarding Islamic Eschatology?

**Category:** Eschatology

The speaker expresses concern about Imran Hussein's claims about Islamic Eschatology, stating that he hasn't found any reliable source material to support Hussein's statements. He believes that any criticism of Hussein's claims should be based on thorough research and a clear understanding of his arguments. 

The speaker suggests that if Hussein's statements are being presented as entertainment, it's important to distinguish them from serious theological discussions. He suggests that viewers should carefully scrutinize Hussein's claims and rely on verified sources before drawing conclusions.

If there were two entities, one would have to have a feature that the other lacks. This would create a deficiency in the entity without the feature, meaning that its existence depends on the other. Since both entities are necessary, their existence cannot be contingent.  

##  If there is only one entity, how can we perceive multiple things?

## 127.34s:  Gospel 
**Question:**  How come this more important event, which should be a celebrating moment, is not in the current gospels in our hands? 
**Answer:** The speaker proposes that the event in question is not in the current gospels because there were many gospels in circulation during the 4th Century.

## 143.94s: Problem 
**Question:** This is called a so-called problem, but I would say the best resolution is to say that evidently in the current gospels, even the four books which are selected to be the best available at that time, there are many others going on in people's hands. 
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the absence of a specific event from the current gospels is not a real problem, because many gospels were available during that time. The speaker also points out that even the current gospels contain fabricated stories, like the Christmas Story, suggesting that some information may have been deliberately omitted. 

## 242.22s: Fabrication 
**Question:** There are also fabrications in Matthew. For example, after the crucifixion there was a massive earthquake, the grave split, and hundreds of people came out of the graves, and walked in Jerusalem.  Why is this not mentioned in any other gospels? 
**Answer:**  The speaker cites Matthew's account of a post-crucifixion earthquake and resurrection of the dead as a clear fabrication.  The speaker emphasizes that this event is not mentioned in any other gospels, nor is it recorded in any other historical records.

## 408.539s:  Samuel

## 495.24s: Isa 
**Question:** When Allah says to Isa, "I will purify you from the disbelievers so they will not be able to put their hand on you and they will leave you to me," does this mean that Isa was lifted up to heaven immediately before he was apprehended?

## 5875.86s:  Earth 
**Question:** Why is the Surah mentioned Earth and Sky despite the Earth being a small part of the sky?

## 1676.539s: Consort
**Question:** Is Mary, the mother of Jesus, the consort of Allah? 
**Answer:** The speaker addresses the claim that Mary is the consort of Allah.  This idea is rooted in a dualistic theory of good and evil, which was common in Babylonian mythology, where the gods were seen as having a consort who gave birth to both good and evil. 

## 1742.82s: Mother
**Question:** Is Mary, the mother of Jesus, the mother of god?
**Answer:** The speaker explains that calling Mary the mother of god comes from a misunderstanding of the concept of divinity.  Some people see divinity as a genus or species, and believe that Jesus, as a divine being, passed on his divinity to Mary, making her a divine being as well.

**Question:** Is divinity a genus or a type?

**Question:** Why do people call Mary a mother goddess or the mother of God?

## 2004.659s: Mother of God 
**Question:** Is calling Mary the mother of god the same as appointing her as a divine being? 
**Answer:** The speaker explains that calling Mary the mother of god is essentially the same as appointing her as a divine being. The speaker argues that this is a common misconception and that the idea of Mary as a divine being is not supported by the Quran.  

## 2062.2s: Known 
**Question:** If Jesus had said that he was divine or that his mother was divine, wouldn't we know it?
**Answer:**  The speaker explains that if Jesus had made these claims, there would be witnesses and evidence to support them.  This is the basis for the Quranic challenge to prove that Jesus made such claims.  

## 2105.52s: Title
**Question:** The Gospel of Mark is titled, "The Gospel of Jesus Christ, Son of God."  Does this mean that Jesus himself claimed divinity?
**Answer:**  The speaker explains that the title of the Gospel of Mark is the publisher's choice and does not reflect the content of the book itself. The speaker further argues that the content of the book itself does not provide strong evidence that Jesus claimed divinity.  

## 2409.18s: Submission
**Question:** Is the verse in question a submission to Christians?

## 2438.099s: Purpose

## What are the various entries to the issue of trinity?

Although not a major event today, the document was considered a genuine expression of trinitarian faith in the following centuries.

## What is the fundamental fallacy in discussing the Godhead?
**Category:** Philosophy

The speaker believes that the fundamental fallacy in discussing the Godhead is assuming it's a monotheistic theory, studying it in the sense of Old Testament scriptures and philosophical development. This approach relies on simple language, but when discussing a divine being that exists necessarily, it requires a more sophisticated philosophical approach, distinguishing between contingent and necessarily existing beings.

## What is the problem with the concept of Godhead?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker argues that there is no category called Godhead. The divine being is a singular, necessarily existing entity. The concept of Godhead as a classification, similar to "animalhood" or "humanity," is a fallacy. This is because the divine being is unique, not a genus or species that can be categorized.

## What is the issue with the statement "He himself is the father of his own essence"?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker finds the statement "He himself is the father of his own essence" problematic. It implies the divine being begot itself, which is nonsensical. The speaker suggests a more accurate statement would be that the divine being exists by necessity, avoiding the concept of self-begetting.

## What is the problem with the mirror model of the Trinity?
**Category:** Philosophy

The speaker criticizes the mirror model of the Trinity, which suggests the divine being looks at itself, sees its image as the Son, and the relationship between them as the Holy Spirit. The speaker points out that this model relies on the idea of external reflection, whereas the divine being exists eternally and is not subject to external influences. Additionally, this model leads to an infinite regress of reflections, which contradicts the idea of a singular, necessarily existing being.

## What are some other attempts to explain the Trinity? 
**Category:** Theology

The speaker lists various attempts to explain the Trinity, including:

* **The Modalist Approach:** This approach suggests that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different aspects or modes of the same being. This leads to issues with the concept of separate personalities, as well as the concept of sacrifice and salvation.
* **The Soul Analogy:** This analogy compares the Trinity to the relationship between a soul, its knowledge, and its love. However, the speaker points out that the mind is not separate from the being, and attributes are not separate entities.
* **The Cube Analogy:** This analogy compares the Trinity to the six sides of a cube, which are distinct yet part of the same whole. However, this analogy fails because the sides of a cube are not themselves cubes, and they can be separated.

## What is the key to understanding the Trinity?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker suggests that the key to understanding the Trinity is to approach it historically, starting with the origins of the concept and its development. He emphasizes that the scriptures themselves do not clearly define the Trinity in the way it is understood today. 

## What is the proper approach to studying the Trinity?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker suggests a two-pronged approach to studying the Trinity:

1. **Historical Context:** Analyze the historical development of the concept, including its roots in Greek philosophy and its evolution within Christianity.
2. **Scriptural Scrutiny:** Examine the scriptures critically, identifying inconsistencies and potential fabrications, while recognizing that the scriptures cannot be considered infallible.

## What are some examples of historical fabrications in the scriptures?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker points to several examples of historical fabrications in the scriptures, such as:

* **The story of the three persons visiting Abraham:** The speaker argues that this story should not be interpreted as evidence for the Trinity, as the Old Testament contains numerous instances of Yahweh appearing in various forms.
* **The story of the circumcision of Isaac:** The speaker argues that this story is likely fabricated to emphasize the importance of circumcision and that the idea of Yahweh coming to kill Isaac is nonsensical.
* **The attribution of the five books of Moses to Moses himself:** The speaker points out that these books contain descriptions of Moses's death, which is impossible for him to have written.

## Why should we not blindly accept the scriptures as infallible?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker argues that blindly accepting the scriptures as infallible is intellectually irresponsible. The scriptures should be subjected to critical scrutiny, cross-referencing, and historical analysis to identify inconsistencies and potential fabrications.

## What is the role of philosophy in understanding the divine? 
**Category:** Philosophy

The speaker emphasizes the importance of philosophical discourse in understanding the divine. He highlights the contributions of Islamic scholars, particularly those in the Shia tradition, who advanced philosophical concepts like contingency and the necessarily existing being. He criticizes Western scholarship for neglecting these developments, which could have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the divine.

## What is the problem with the idea of "created" when it comes to the Quran?
**Category:** Theology

The speaker addresses the confusion surrounding the idea of the Quran being "created." He clarifies that the Quran is not the divine knowledge itself, but rather a revelation of that knowledge. He argues that the notion of a "created" Quran is based on a misunderstanding of space, time, and divine will.

## What are the key takeaways from the discussion?
**Category:** Summary

The discussion highlights the following key takeaways:

* **The concept of Godhead is a fallacy:** There is only one, necessarily existing divine entity, not a category or genus.
* **The Trinity is a problematic concept:** The various attempts to explain the Trinity, including the mirror model and the modalist approach, are ultimately flawed and lead to contradictions.
* **The scriptures should be studied critically:** We should not blindly accept the scriptures as infallible. They require scrutiny, cross-referencing, and historical analysis.
* **Philosophy plays a vital role in understanding the divine:**  Philosophical discourse, particularly in the Islamic tradition, provides valuable insights into the nature of the divine. 
* **The proper approach to studying the Trinity is historical:** By understanding its historical development and its roots in Greek philosophy, we can better appreciate its limitations and its implications.

**Category:** Geopolitics

135.0s : that's relate to that what I'm going to say now to conclude before concluding all the recent leaks uh is is preparing this Israel has 50 15 exceptional Rockets who shoot behind the horiz Horizon called golden horizon has 50 they can be shot from airlanes have 50 have three tankers or tank tanker airlanes and they are training for attacks Etc back and forth this could be true or could be just plff and or other they will attack the nuclear no they will not attack they may attack the headquarters of the IRG no maybe they will attack the president maybe they will attack Kam himself which is becoming now stronger after the issue with the attack against Netanyahu maybe this not maybe the the oil field maybe not the oil field all of this back and forth and the White House sometime confirming sometime denying some they asking is to R so I say we cannot control them I think all of that is designed to create considerable amount of confusion especially since Israel America have recognized that the current leadership this new m soal m pres president of of um of Iran uh this man has proven to be really uh politically a dumb a dumb person definitely he doesn't know how to express himself properly and uh and all his expression show weakness and will and and encourage the Israelis to push him further and further and further now my conclusion the following one of two either all of this all these Leakes and so on true or not true are designed to keep Iran in suspense terrify them that they can do no more action so that is can take its time and work with demolishing on the sh in Lebanon smashing their Villages essentially committing a genocide besid obviously killing as many aspects of the fighter in the South they may not a victory but if they could cause considerable harm so that hisbah is weakened and his base in Lebanon is is decimated that will be a relative success for them push him even with high blood cost for for them to behind the Lani and get the settlers back in the RO that's the intention while Iran is just Frozen like uh like the snake which is being played by the snake Master being being terrified and sing he sings and and and and uses drums and so on and the snake is Dancing with him because it's just being controlled by the movement because the the snake Master is having more intelligence than the snake and and as a matter of fact the snake is more deadly than the sake Master but it cannot exercise it deadliness because it doesn't have the mental capacity to recognize that it has certain strength which can be exercised it seems to be just like that Iran and the option it that mean that's all that is just a bluff just to delay and to prevent Iran from stepping in until they can finish their business with with Gaza and so on that's one the other option is really they are planning for a strike which will be most likely very painful whatever the case may be if I were in place of the Iran lead leadership if I were I'm not saying this an advice for them because I know that they will not listen to advice if in their place I will take the initiative and strike fast take a preemptive strike which is back breaking but not decapitating meaning all airport all military airports will be smashed that's five of them the power station which need only a small small number of rockets three four Hypersonic and maybe 105 uh ballistic Hypersonic ballistics which can be maybe intercepted but the Hypersonic the low flying hypersonics are difficult to intercept these this number is enough for every Power Station if you hit the center of the power station and the cury now is sufficient for that you can't they they will be demolished the five power station and they have two they have two only uh refiners these will be taken out and also some strategic and political targets like for example the the Prime Minister office the ministry of Defense uh the mosad uh unit 8,200 uh Camp uh the various major Radars for these T system and uh uh yeah and things like that and the the KET the house of Netanyahu and his office and so on that would be pushing Israel to the border of nuclear escalation then they have to make a decision either they go nuclear which would end of their Annihilation most likely this will not happen the probability of that is extremely low or they will give up and agree on ceasefire and stopping the fight and then they can LIF to their own design to collapse and disintegrate internally that what I would do if Iran does that this will be miraculous and it will save them from the strike because the strike is coming inevitably even if it delayed several months Israel will be preparing more having more facilities more s systems more new raders uh uh the gulf countries will be encouraged seeing Iran is is is afraid and and intimidated they will cooperate more with Israel uh the bases in the Gulf will will rearrange themselves to to to be more punful against Iran and the next attack will be as devastating as the one allegedly planed that maybe twice or three times so will they do that allaham we don't know I hope they will wake up to the reality and take a preemptive strike and there's not very much time remaining because if a strike is really planned and will be done if it's not just a bluff it will be toward the end of October so that they can declare Victory show pictures videos uh brag around and affect American elections and any backlash or any problems for them they can cover it up at least until the election day after that there's no problem if the election is over then they will be able to spin and manage things as as needed as the result of the election so I think that's the way to go but will they go this way hopefully maybe some miracle Could Happen although I'm doubting for that I'm doubting that very strongly so let's wait and see by next week maybe things will be more clearer we'll be there until next weekend um at that maybe it is the 27th still few days ahead still almost a week ahead of the American election that's maybe a little bit too far maybe they will do it like the 29th 30th of October but it could be by the 27 we'll meet next week insh we'll see what happens

The speaker believes that the current situation is highly volatile and that there are two possible scenarios. First, Israel is deliberately creating confusion and fear to weaken Iran and prevent them from taking action. Second, Israel is preparing for a devastating preemptive strike against Iran. He suggests that Iran is not a match for Israel militarily, but that they should take a preemptive strike before they are further weakened. The speaker is skeptical of Iran's ability to take decisive action but hopes that they will do so before it's too late.

##  0:52.5  | Session|  Today is session 112, we are on Aya 112 of Surat Al-Maida. 

## 1:32.78 | Recitation| I wonder did we do that last time, because I added the eye after that.  

## 2:01.18 | Interpretation| Believers you are responsible for your own souls. Those who go astray cannot harm you if you are on the right path. All of you will return to God, and he will tell you what you used to do.  

## 2:53.58 | Interpretation| Focus on yourselves, it doesn't harm you. Yeah, maybe I did not do that. It doesn't harm you, uh, whoever got astray if you are guided. So focus on getting self-guided, getting yourself from the right path. The your return would be to Allah, and he will inform all of you about that, what you have been doing. Yeah, that's it. 

## 2:58.959 | Interpretation| The meaning is very clear. There was some, some uh, issue relating to understanding.  

## 3:12.419 | Narrative| There's a narrative about some issue that happened by the ashari, if they have the, the tribe of ashari who came up with the Giant from Abussini was coming back from Abyssinian and arrived at Medina when the prophet was in high bar, and then he proceeded to harbor together with one of them and his brothers and so on. And one of these Ashari there was some issue in their tribe, not in this in the battle Campbell of hybrid maybe, but after that. 

## 3:33.6 | Narrative| He did not do the necessary intervention or something like that. A messenger, why didn't you change the prophet, evil, or he obviously has the capability and the necessary authority. 

## 3:47.3 | Narrative| The prophet answered, "Because I listened to what Allah said, focus on yourself, you'll not be Mr will you will, you will not be accounted for that, it will not harm you for those who got us three, uh, because he said why did you get this interpretation? It is the meaning of that, it is the, the, those who got astray from the kofar, they will not harm you. Their costume, not harm you. That's it. Not that it doesn't apply to any believer. 

## 3:59.639 | Narrative| And also if you look at the wedding of the Ayah, you see how, how people come sometimes misunderstood. So this is it doesn't have, you all got to go astray when you are guided. That's not who commits sin and you are not crazy and you are not doing it. No, this is, and usually when going astray or a guidance is, not about believer doing mistakes which others should command and enjoying them to change and etc. So this is the only collection, there's still understanding. 

## 4:20.18 | Interpretation| So this is, it will not harm you with a disbeliever that I believe I want to stay. If they are guided and you fall to the right path, so don't worry about that. Focus on that. It does not mean, for example, even for this video, but that you don't call them to Islam. That doesn't debate with them in good times to get them back from some of the misguidance. No, it doesn't mean that, but that you should not be concerned about that in the sense that you grieve or think you are responsible. No, they are responsive of their own acts and so on, but you are still have the enjoyment of calling them to Islam, to God, to wear that, give them good admonishment and good advice etc. etc.  

## 4:57.38 | Interpretation| So that's I think that we did not touch this last time. So, so I want to just assess that point that is does not have anything to do with the command good and forbidden evil or or does not have any, uh, any restricting meaning to the Surah that all humans are lost except for enjoying, and enjoy it to each other or admonish each other for hack and for Sabbath is right and to be persistent and perseverance in sticking to the truth.  

## 4:92.18 | Interpretation| Because usually sticking to the truth is usually painful and Peter. This, this is different than this one. Here it is, those who go astray by their own will, willful doing, will not harm you. But if you fail to, to do your detail of calling to Islam and so on, when it is possible, or for the entire inside the believer we have the obligation of commanding good at video, forbidding evil which is in the injunction of the Quran, Sunnah in many places, then that will harm you because you've helped your duty. So nobody should misunderstand that like this. 

## 5:31.3 | Narrative| Even companion could fall in such a misinterpretation because they have not really absorbed the meaning or did not get enough education over the prophet because they are late in companionship. But even all this companion could make mistakes.  

## 5:49.3 | Narrative| Some people sometimes have said the companions say that they think it's a lecture the moment someone become a companion, somehow you grow wings and become like an angel. This misconception we almost clean from our head, and it will come down in Shabba and in the next Ayah, so that's the meaning of this area. 

## 5:61.72 | Interpretation| That's the comet otherwise it's clear so don't be, uh, don't think that, that you will be harmed by those going in Michigan going to miscarriage by the old design. We are not harmful for you as long as your own duty and you are getting back guided part of being guided is that you carry the dawa when it is appropriate. Obviously, is not an obligation, except for those who who have sufficient knowledge and have in certain position of dawah, but cutting down the other remote inside the Muslim Community is an obligation especially against the rulers and with the rules that's fundamentalist part of the description of the Believers which we I think came to Surah when you said the main characteristic of the Believers as a community, both male and female, that they come out good and very evil and believe in Allah as messenger and performs Allah etc. They say the commander good, they are alive, they support each other, they come out good and forbid even, even a head even believing in Allah we know we realize the base, but this is for such importance in that context that it's mentioned even ahead also more important eyes. 

## 6:31.86 | Interpretation| So that's the, that's what this ISO do not be, I think that these who are one, that's three, will harm you as long as you are guided or part of being guided is to do your duties, whatever it is, and do as much as possible from these reality things, if you're capable and if you you have a facility for that like, for example, if you are a qualified man, who for example, has a long arm and long information about, for example, the various we will come to that, it is maybe today or next time what the various publication and mistakes in the scripture description to inform that people have that and call them to islamans, correction for those mistakes in the description and so on.  

## 6:74.04 | Interpretation| But that's obviously what becomes an obligation for if there is nobody else doing it, and secondly, if you are really well established in that, but otherwise you don't follow up with this believer of going with the misguidance and uh, but inside the Islamic Camp there you have no Liberty references of this evidence, especially from the rulers. You have to change it if if necessary. If it is the level of coverage by false, if not capable, then by word. If not capable, then at least in the heart you have to condemn it and reject it and train yourself to, by word or by the sword, if necessary. 

## 7:09.86 | Interpretation| So that nobody should confuse that this is a liberty or exclusion from commanding God of everything inside the Muslim Community. 

## 7:23.959 | Interpretation| So concluding, all of you will be sent to Allah and he will inform everyone what he's doing. So get focused on yourself that you're even guided because you will be questioned about all your Deeds, so they don't divert your attention well for that which is not your job. Do your job and your job is to be guided. 

## 7:47.019 | Interpretation| Corrupt or they deviate, they are capable usually to be corrupt and male and destroy the whole society much faster than any single person. But that is another, another issue, which we call it Indulgence and put detail we have a complete book about that inshallah, will have second edition coming soon and also translated.  

## 8:09.279 | Interpretation| Oh ye you believe, let there be Witnesses between you when Death groweth knife. This is ridiculous. This is like 15th century or something to get pixels. They should have, there's a Modern English version of it. I don't know why it is.  

## 8:30.54 | Interpretation| The best of English test is that polypical. Well, this is yeah, from 1500s. This is, this is a oh ye who believe. This is just the best one is Kafka, so they cut through the unnecessary uh, so this one's good. I mean, Believers, when Death approaches you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses to the writing of your will. If death approaches you while you are traveling far from home, let two just men from among other from among another people act as Witnesses. Take hold of the two men after having prayed and if you have any doubts in your mind, let each of them pray to God, we will not sell our word for any price even if it were for the sake of a mere relative. We will not hide God's testimony or else we will be counted among the sinful. Okay, so the first collection is that they said two just men, no, it is honesty and truthfulness, these two. It is used also for the feminine and general injunctions, so so it could be men and women. So that's, that's bad, but this one is stuck in his mentality that woman cannot be Witnesses or on his restricted way, which is his fallacy and you remember, we discussed at the end of this fallacy is still stuck in many brains.  

## 9:12.18 | Interpretation| That's number one. So are the two of Justice? What are these two, female, female, uh, male, female, uh, whatever. Neutral, if they success doesn't exist, obviously, despite all these LGBT etc. nonsense. But if it is done, that was that they just, and they are people of justice and honesty and the Integrity, so that their witnesses can be, uh, can be relied upon. 

## 9:38.279 | Interpretation| Principle from you, what does he say from you? Some translate from your own people, without meaning God's Own people. They are trying to run away because there were two points of view since ancient times. What is from you, meaning the correct point of view. Establish stressed and brought to so many narratives from webinar bus, and many other companions. Majority, not all, but the majority of Companions. And is it from your meaning from the believing was, from the from the belief of the Muslims? 

## 9:65.12 | Interpretation| And or two others from from the others too. To just people also which you perceive to be just again it doesn't say just, want to say two others from that, from from outside not from you, and the correct point of view it is from non-believers people outside Islam and you'll find many others saying from the people of the book, but this is restricting something which Allah did not restricted. Allah could have said from the word, no, that's not that's putting in Allah's mouth what he did not say. That's wrong. It's from any outside the correct point of view from those from you. 

## 10:01.279 | Interpretation| Do just one could be men could be a man and woman etc. in in control distinction and rejection of the misconception which has been digging itself deep in Islamic history and Islamic scholarship and from the others will be outside the Muslim faith, from other faith and other beliefs. 

## 10:22.579 | Interpretation| And this is specifically the, but it is not a condition. 

## 10:30.16 | Interpretation| Are going back and forth on Earth, meaning you are not at home. That's how it usually happens, but there's not been this is necessary condition for this, for this situation. 

## 10:42.52 | Interpretation| Some people say this is a condition that if you have, uh, from from the other Faith only is it, it's as conditional on that, but definitely this is not persuasive. 

## 10:53.059 | Interpretation| That's it, it is being being on on travel and so on, the story, which is the revision came to is about travel. I will mention the story soon but that, that should be not regarded as persuasive and comparing. But this is normally where it happens because you're in your home, unsettled and then and you feel that approaching then there will be relatives nearby, there'll be, there'll be but there'll be enough Witnesses and relatives, and even lawyers and so on available to do that.  

## 10:81.62 | Interpretation| There is no need to go into this complex regulation. So this will be mostly and almost exclusively happening only if you are not at home, you are going to travel and we mentioned that when we mention the story become clear what means, and then you are suddenly feeling this approach, getting falling sick, getting an infection, getting a deadly injury, and then we have you have to manage that, and these, these two have to be, uh, forced to stand after prayer. 

## 11:12.84 | Interpretation| So that they make an oath by Allah, but only inner septum if you have a doubt about their witness. If there's no doubt, there's no reason for that, then only today, that you receive the testimony, what they have they're delivering. I will mention exactly what that was exactly I mean, we're delivering, and then everything looks correct. There's nothing which missing there, whichever any hinting, does it then there is no need to get them to make an oath after the prayer. Whose prayer of also we'll get to that also that because you have doubt, and they make an oath that we make about Allah that we are not going, uh, for for any motivation even if it's beneficial for one of our next option, and we are not going to hide anything for the witness of Allah otherwise we are definitely sinful and unjust.  

## 11:69.88 | Interpretation| So it seems to be that mentioning looks like how to apply that for people who are not a Believer but that is because because the the people do not follow the the the the straight in the Stream of the of the evidence of the ayas because it says you could say it is it has two two different statements that have merged together with an or in between. If you ask them on traveling away and so on, and then this surprises you, then get to Witnesses of of Justice from you from the believer. 

## 12:08.64 | Interpretation| But if, when they come to deliver the the the Wasilla, the will or the, what they, what the dying person has with him to commence money etc., the story will clarify with what we may have and they deliver it and everything seems to be in order. There's no need to doubt anything. There's no need for them, let usually them to stand, get them to the court, and ask him to after Salah, that's for the believer, obviously, as we're talking about Muslim, and then, uh, they make an author, a very heavily author, like that without also the heaviness of the author is also indicated by the should do it because the tool do heavy Oaths and very binding us after starting thus far in the case two just from us to to, uh, two from other from other people. 

## 12:63.539 | Interpretation| Manhattan, and then we have a reason for doubt, not just because they're from other people, but there is maybe they deliver things perfectly, there's nothing to be the doubt about just physically fine, no problem. But if there's any reason of Doubt, then you can apply to the court. It must be done by the authority, and they have to do something equivalent to swearing after certain hustle now the Believers. 

## 12:83.34 | Interpretation| The disabiliters may not have such also. They may not respect it also, what also means for us doesn't mean anything in that case. They have to integrate it after such such a ritual of them which is very heavy and binding. Whatever the ritual may be, for example, let me give the extreme case of an atheist, says I don't play, I don't believe in does God exist, but I can make an oath under the penalty of bursary and on my honor that is the truth, nothing that the truth and the completed I delivered completely what have been given to me from the dying person, so and so on and I assigned to the effect in front of the court and on a pronounce it publicly or dictate to someone if he's illiterate and put my seal or my thumb on it, that will be the equivalent of salt Russell for a Christian. It may be taking the Cross and putting it on the Bible if it has on top of it. For a Jew, there is no cross, but he can put his hand on the, on the Old Testament. Whatever it is which is equivalent and uh, so it's from foreign. 

## 13:60.64 | Interpretation| From another Faith just inserted between under the rest applies to them appropriately foreign. 

## 13:88.84 | Interpretation| This is only for the believing one. For them is highly, uh, highly, highly respectable, and they and they have to attend us Allah with the community and with the judge and then after Salah, they are brought to the court of law or the judges are sitting in the Masjid, and they do the oath, the heavy oath con fortified by being after for the non-believer clearly doesn't make any sense to get them in Salah and all have the fortification of solar generally, so so for so so what what's the meaning such a ritual of their side which is as binding according to their faith, and they gave the extreme example over atheists even, so I think it should be read like that because that's that's how how Quran should be, that at most generality which does not but across the borders of rationality and linguistic limitation and they might make an oath by Allah in the case of this believer, maybe you cannot buy their owner or make sure I make an author without mentioning Allah, otherwise but under the penalty of perjury that I have truthful that I'm telling the whole truth, I'm not hiding anything. The usual ones you people put it affidavit in Britain which is don't necessarily do actually, the the English law does not specify that you make an oath by Allah or by God or anyone just by make an oath other penalty of perjury so on, so and so on. 

## 14:75.28 | Interpretation| Uh under whatever your regardless as a name for this foreign. 

## 14:97.26 | Interpretation| Let me give an example for that. You may have you may be in trouble in a business every time past business travel, so people under some uh people who are not believer with you, but they are remotely related, or they from the same tribe, and they have maybe in low relation with the with the with some of the hairs and then they hide some of the things or some of the instructions written instructions of the dying person. Because this way, their in-laws will benefit more from that, that will be British of thrusters will be a higher fabrication. Let me just mention so before going through an abstract things, mention what the story which we have uh was supposedly the reason of Revelation obviously the national or not all nicely synchronized with each other, but the corner of story seems to be well established.  

## 15:49.26 | Interpretation| The story is the following, admitted to you. Yeah. Yeah, so don't make any mistakes. 

## 15:57.419 | Interpretation| So this story the main story is narrated from Tabari gives his snad also have maybe question here and there, um, no, this one is good. That's from the outside of his son, Abdul America from his father, a man from balisam, uh, that's uh, that his name is Mission. Another narration, uh, who is by genealogy but by Alliance he was a freed slave, but one of the went out that time was Christian, and he was a Christian until late. He's famous with the Hadith of Justice, if anyone is interested. And his cousin or next, both of them are Christian by Alliance, uh, face death, and then he and then he entrusted them with what he has with him. They were going for business, they, they were, they were usually going between Medina and Sham and yeah, and Mecca before even immigration. So then that is for a long time and he was most likely doing a lot of business with some before they immigrated and when they went to the Medina, if immigration because Moses customer and the business partner where the one who arrest Islam and went to Medina, his community was between sham and Madina more frequently than Mecca, but maybe other business partners too. We don't know, but that's what and his cousin or his brother was with him back and forth, and one day she said his brother maybe his brother for a mother only because not the son of bada, but anyway I can shake it, that's his trivial points interesting for us, both our business part and going back and forth. 

## 16:70.039 | Interpretation| So he gave them what he has with him because they were going for business, he has obviously goods and so on, and the, the most valuable things he had is a pot out of silver with with gold ornamentation highly valuable heavy and highly valuable obviously going to Sham where obviously they have the Roman Empire and we have three that coming going to the Persian Empire. This is something uh high-class people and Kings as I usually buy so he was hoping to get some good money for that of considerable money because of this gold ornamentation like like palm tree leaves and so on. 

## 17:07.84 | Interpretation| And on, clearly you cannot use it in Medina, because using gold and silver poses Haram in Islam, so whatever it is and other things. 

## 17:16.299 | Interpretation| So he trusted them with that, put the things in, in suitcases and luggages. One narration claimed that he wrote exactly what is there and hit it somewhere in like a small pocket and so on in the Box, just because it's a precaution. Uh, another nation there's nothing to that and say about the people back home before he went have a good record what he has. Either way, it seemed to me I don't exclude either, I don't exclude either. I, I would say such a seasoned business whom they trust to travel and so on, will be with the god we take us enough to keep this exact recording of things. So he will, death is approaching, he is not going to survive, so he wrote this documentary obviously he's killed their writing and so on, so it's quite polished and educated this person. I'll get his name shell from the next narration, and hit it in that, and the, um, evidence or commitment because Christian usually the committed Christians are honest and and they don't take Liberties. The Jews, they may have some people say even if they are practicing, they say ah we can we can take home. We remember we discussed that issue and how Allah condemned that area in the Quran, but Christians are not known for that generally. They are not known for that, but anyway, this man seems to be not as that good practice. Is more of a businessman with a bit of loose morality, so I said okay, we'll bring that to your family when we back to Medina, and then they could not resist the temptation to open one of the of the bags, or would they know where he have the valuable pot, the gold, the gold ornament, the silver pot and the doctor sold it for their own up counts. I mean, let's close everything when they delivered, they go to the family said well, what's happening? We remember that he has these and these things, or another narration said they should they've checked and they found this hidden like a hidden Pocket. They found this, this the certain documents, what is, what is all in these bags or these suitcases, uh, and his luggage and something is missing. And the, the other nations say then either either by this or by this or by both, it could be very well that make the check the records so it's very reasonable to check records. 

## 18:79.76 | Interpretation| Maybe he was sick for a long time and he decided something to spend on his result responsible also. No, no, no, the gifted, no. So she said, but this item is missing based on that. There was a doubt about this, this handing over of this. So they went to the messenger of Allah said without these people because we have this Reasonable Doubt, at least some doubt that something is missing, and these guys maybe have taken it. It may someone, it may be it was stolen from him, but if he has written a record, that would be but I don't know the story of the thing before this question about it. Anyway, we don't know, so the Messenger will ask him to make an author, and they make an oath, and that's it and the matter was settled.  

## 18:92.779 | Interpretation| Now this narration is very Abridged. Another narration is more expanded. It says and the other thing was was the later on the the pot was found either in sham or in in in in Mecca or a third narration claim that himself after embracing Islam felt guilty and admitted to them. So you're allowed to them that we, we, we, we, we just we broke the trust and we sold that and put the money in our pocket. I took 500 Dirham and uh, whatever how it was detected. The pot was mostly I think the most reasonable stories that was found in Mecca because maybe they proceed to Mecca and thought Mac has far away and hostile to become before the conquest of Makkah to Medina, nobody will, will come to, but somehow some people saw it in Mecca and reported to them, and then they is investigated a little bit and they tell out that the the those who have it in America saying we bought it from them. 

## 19:88.84 | Interpretation| So now, now the plot is clear. So Next Step, they, they went to the messenger of Allah with this now with these facts. No, there's not doubt anymore. These are the factory had been determined that it's sold by away, and that, so their testimony and the oath that have delivered everything they did not take anything. If they have sold it and there's good reason that, uh, what, what we have investigated Mecca is through because the other guys, they have no interest to accuse, to to be, to to telling that we bought it from XYZ, which is not mixed with, oh, yeah, we bought them from these two guys, not from from armor or Zed or from these two.  

## 19:95.899 | Interpretation| So they went for the messenger of Allah and they said, despite of these are clearly the author of that has been shown that this is false oath, these two, but they asked the, the people, do you have a further evidence than just male that it had been found there?  

## 20:40.0 | Interpretation| And they say, "No," say, "Are you winning R2 from you, are willing to make an oath by Allah that our, our, that investigation is more reliable, more trustworthy than the initial claim of of these two guys?" They said, "You are winning." And in one, I said one of them was, so it means the story must be after before the conquest of Mecca, but after immigrated together, because he immigrated in the in the library time, so in that time of living, so it must be after that, or even maybe after the conquest of Mecca. We don't know what's happened anyway, it's relatively late. So let's say, eighth year, ninth seventh year, eighth year, nine year, so it's quite early. Sorry, and then the Quran came down to, uh, to confirm the survive whatever you think. 

## 20:94.32 | Interpretation| I'll keep it on record. The wisdom of that has skipped a record. One of it is that when you previously link that everything is fine and the witnesses have been they made even for the lost witnesses, that you can open a code, because this crazy became final, and everything was as it is, until New Evidence came forward to in on the balance show that these guys have lied. 

## 21:24.96 | Interpretation| Any, any court case which someone lies or there's a collusion or something like that even in the Western, in the, in the UK law and most laws or another fundamental effect in the in the proceeding can be worth it even if it has confined it was fine and people distributed the money and initials were done, everything is gone, it can't be still over 10. So this, this point, nobody from characteristics scholar or Tabari has stressed. So it can be over 10, but in that is not enough, that, that, uh, that, that's proven that we Allied because the real the truth may be something else. We don't know, uh, maybe they have forgotten, maybe we don't know what's exactly. So they have to make to affirm their right by making an oath. They just found out that our result of Investigation we are convinced that our result of Investigation is preferable and stronger than their oath and and this way. 

## 21:79.32 | Interpretation| So they have to do the author in the name of Allah, that same way, and then they will be, then, then the other ones will be, would be found guilty and they are forced to retain what they have resolved and and theft, it doesn't need to be like, like a such a gold item or other merchandise could be, for example, give you an example, a document for example.  

## 22:01.3 | Interpretation| Someone is traveling with other people, and then if his death is coming, and in that trouble, or maybe he married a woman in another city and did not tell his family, but whatever he said, it's not good, not to do that because you see how it can happen, but now he felt guilty that she may be neglected from inheritance or should, should be accused. So realize the documentation to let, let me know that I am married to a lady so and so on, that's her address. So if I, if, if I die, my companion will bring this document with them to you, so that you don't take care, you don't allocate her right in health, for example, and one of these guys is the relative tool to maybe a wife of this one who is dying or to an in-law, and you say ah this will reduce the share of myself my my uh uh that wife the other wife which related to me or reduce the share of other in-laws. Now let me hide it, don't deliver it. 

## 22:57.98 | Interpretation| And later on things come to the daylight, that woman come and bring witnesses there for the marriage and so on and and it's a it is the expose that they have done the obviously the the the the people have to make an author and make sure that our, our our submissions are more reliable and more than these people who have hidden that documents. Well, it can't be a document, usually people not hide the document, which has no monetary value. That's what's human nature is unfortunately human greed what it is everywhere.  

## 22:91.4 | Interpretation| So, so, this is the story clarify what's going on, so it is what really all these great Witnesses etc. in the Ayah is actually meaning Oaths because really they are delivering documents or delivering Goods. So there's just an oath that we delivered everything, and we do not help withheld anything, that we did not take anything for us, or did not hide anything for our own interest, or anyone who is maybe next of kin who may benefit from hiding or absolutely clean, neutral not benefiting or harming anybody by any intention. 

## 23:22.3 | Interpretation| So that's, that's clarify this and also that point of that there's such a final ruling can be, uh, can be, uh, can be, uh, uh, or a case can be opened and then the previous ruling can be declared null and void is, is clearly, that's one of the reasons I think the Ayah is enshrining that because it seems to be that I came at the end after all of that was settled, Allah did not interfere in the whole process until it has completed and then that, that I was able to record that and give put the system in place until you almost came unfortunately most, most Focus actually got stuck with with the imaginary conception. The most problem they had is that a witness could be unuslim, and they try to beat around the bush and so on, but already answered them very strongly persuasively, and even hasn't bashed them badly for that, so it is a mockery to claim that's two or two just Witnesses from you, meaning from your own tribe or immoral City, and from the others, Allah. 

## 23:84.0 | Interpretation| From you, meaning from the believing Community, for the believer. And the witnesses from outside you is the one from not from the believer, because the address is to the believer, or you believe, is not the address to the people of Medina or or people of a village or a tribe, and the address of colonies usually to the believer. Ali says clearly said, this is addressed to the people in the in the immigration domain. Like, for example, will come to it that this is that you have no, no Allegiance or or or belonging to those who breastfeed but did not immigrate. So it's clearly addressing the immigrants, though people certain in Medina, the domain of immigration Islam, those who did not immigrate do not have the all the rights and and the aggregation from a text that is addressing those in the immigration domain only.  

## 24:27.02 | Interpretation| They don't have any relation with those until they immigrate except if they ask for help, because they are present religion then help them, all conditions so and so on, so on, will come to that sort of function. It's a very important issue with Allegiance so the address holds to the believer and all the believer, even if they outside the Islamic domain, even if they are living under the ruling of copper by legitimately or even Symphony, this is totally believable to exclude someone. You have to bring at everything exclusion. So this is a mockery that people do sometimes in this. 

## 24:75.839 | Interpretation| So that's it. Now, I actually I mentioned the story, I mentioned there are essentially the content of the next Ayah, so let's read the next Ayah and this translation and then put everything together. Already, already have been put together, so the next I will read, thus in the case, some evidence found later on after the first case was set up and done, that those fellows have lied. Either with certainty or high probability like the case of Tamil with Daddy and Adib.  

## 25:16.16 | Interpretation| Yeah. 

## 25:33.98 | Interpretation| But if after they should come to mind that two witnesses have come become guilty of this very sin, uh, then two others from among those who, those who from the whom the former have deprived of their right shall take their place and swear by God, "Our Testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of what is right or else we may indeed be counted among the evildoers." Next translation, if it is discovered that these two are guilty of this sin, then two of those whose rights have been

## What happened on Tuesday or Wednesday? 
**Category:** Pager Incident

The speaker refers to an incident involving pagers. These were a batch of pagers ordered by a company from a reputable Taiwanese company. The pagers were then licensed to a Hungarian company which, in good faith, produced them. These pagers ended up in Sophia, Bulgaria. The pagers were intercepted and loaded with small explosive charges.

## What was the plan for the pagers?
**Category:** Pager Incident

## What has the reaction been to the attacks?

## What is the political implication of the attack?
**Category:** Political Implications

The speaker highlights the political implications of the attacks, drawing a comparison to a speech by N. last November. They argue that N.'s speech in November was a mistake as it encouraged the escalation of violence.

They also point to the United Nations' recent announcement declaring settlements illegal and ordering Israel to withdraw, seeing this as a missed opportunity for international action. 

## What are the potential options for Israel?
**Category:** Strategic Analysis

The speaker discusses the dilemma faced by N.  He argues that N. is facing the possibility of the U.S. not providing significant military aid if he launches a full-scale invasion of Lebanon.

The speaker believes N. is in a difficult situation and that his actions may lead to a greater international backlash.

## What is the impact of the recent events on the conflict?
**Category:** Strategic Analysis

The speaker describes the current state of the conflict as an escalation of the conflict.

## What is the future of the conflict?
**Category:** Strategic Analysis

The speaker believes that the conflict is unlikely to end soon and that Israel is in a state of implosion. They hope that this implosion will accelerate and that the situation will be resolved within a few years.

## What's the full implication of the Ayah? (The verse) The expansion of versions.
**Category:** Islamic Law

The speaker inquires about the practical implications of an Ayah (a verse from the Quran) concerning the expansion of versions within Islamic law.

## Did anyone sit there and say that you can't reduce from that the necessity of having a constitutional or a supreme court?

**Category:** Islamic Leadership

The speaker observes that there is a lack of engagement with the concept of challenging or questioning the rulings of Islamic leaders within the community. He attributes this lack of engagement to the prevalent tendency towards unquestioning obedience, even in cases of perceived injustice or abuse of power. This obedience, according to the speaker, is rooted in specific Islamic teachings and traditions.

**Category:** Islamic Leadership

**Category:** Islamic Law

## What are the meanings of the hadith where the prophet peace be upon him says that a person who commits zinna or steals or drinks wine is not a believer while doing so? 
**Category:** Islamic Law

The speaker explains that the hadith does not mean that the person is not a believer entirely, but rather that their faith is inactive at the moment of the sin. They are not in a state of conscious awareness of their faith and its principles, which is why they are able to commit the act.

## Isn't the verse "and he made you kings" a grace from Allah that he accepted and warranted the request of Jews to become a kingdom, regardless of the fact that kingship was catastrophic?
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker argues that this verse is not a justification of the Jews' request for kingship. The grace of Allah, according to the speaker, refers to their freedom and autonomy as individuals, rather than granting them a kingdom ruled by a king. The speaker emphasizes that the Jews' decision to request a king was a rejection of the decentralized system of prophetic leadership that Allah had initially given them. 

## How does the command for them to enter these places and take over from these people [Canaanites] who have rejected messengers before, work? 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker explains that the command to enter Canaan is part of a broader principle in the Old Testament, where the only option to clear a land from non-believers is through either surrender, departure, or extermination. However, the speaker clarifies that this principle is not a direct justification for the later actions of the Jews. The Quran, according to the speaker, advocates for a more nuanced approach, where those who wish to remain in the land can become citizens under a more inclusive system. 

## Are you referring to the book of Jeremiah, what are you referring to? 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker is referring to the book of Jeremiah in the Old Testament, which, according to tradition, was saved by Jeremiah in a cave on Mount Nebo across the Jordan River during the Babylonian Exile. The speaker believes that these scriptures, if found, could offer insights into the original, unedited versions of the Old Testament.

## If someone kills someone in a moment of rage for tribal reasons, and he gets killed before his iman is active again, does it benefit him? 
**Category:** Islamic Law

The speaker acknowledges that this is a complex situation. While the person may have been in a state of anger and their iman was inactive, it is difficult to say definitively whether they are condemned to hell. The speaker emphasizes that this scenario should serve as a strong warning against allowing anger and vengeance to override one's faith.

## The question is: Isn't the verse "and he made you kings" a grace from Allah that he accepted and warranted the request of Jews to become a kingdom, regardless of the fact that kingship was catastrophic? 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker reiterates their previous point, emphasizing that the verse does not endorse the Jews' request for a monarchy. The grace of Allah, according to the speaker, refers to their individual autonomy, not the establishment of a central authority. The speaker also highlights that the Jews' choice for a king was a step toward enslavement, contradicting their earlier state of freedom.

## What did the text say about our relationship with rulers and regimes as a whole, as you know average Muslims, what should our interaction be with them, what should our perspective be of our rulers? 
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 176.94s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the Quran only explicitly commands obedience to Allah and the messenger.  This obedience is absolute and unconditional.  All other obedience is conditional and dependent upon the person in question acting according to the commands of Allah.

## Where does this very common narrative we you know we hear constantly from you know multiple groups within Islam of this idea of you know obeying Muslim rulers, even being an unjust rulers, you know you've made it pretty clear that you know that's that's where does it come from?
**Category:** Rulership

**Answer:** The speaker explains that this narrative comes from a misinterpretation of a particular Hadith that is taken out of context and contradicts the Quranic principle of conditional obedience. This Hadith is also weak in terms of its chain of narration. 

## What about this concept of Ijma, consensus on this issue now in, uh, there's other nobody narrates or comments on one of the Hadith narrating a consensus on the idea of, uh, as for rebelling against the rule and fighting him is forbidden by consensus of the Muslims, even if it's sinful and oppressive, and that's based in a shot of Muslim of 1840. Is this one, yes no, that's invalid, this is not always a simple-minded man, he's a good man, no doubt about that, is, the area is a Mystic, more more than really a scholar in in the sense, but nevertheless that they were Rebellion against rulers in, in, against Yazid, against, they have been against, they have been, and against it has been, and all of these have been rebellion, and then although acknowledge that and mention all these Revelations and say but that Ishmael has been concluded after that, that's not terrible against oppressive viewers because it leads to bloodshed.
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 1336.32s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the concept of an Ijma forbidding rebellion against rulers is invalid. He explains that the Sahaba did indeed rebel against unjust rulers, and this Hadith is from a Mystic, not a scholar in the true sense of the word. He argues that the rationale behind forbidding rebellion is that it leads to bloodshed. 

##  Sheikh are you saying that there there was a Hobby like who rebelled themselves so this concept of if they ask if states of evidence of Sahaba who rebelled, doesn't that really get rid of Ishma in the first place because then yeah there's nothing to matter it's nothing anywhere.
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 1604.46s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the historical evidence of the Sahaba rebelling against rulers disproves the idea that such acts are always forbidden.  

##  Sheikh, would you say the the type of, or the the type of Scholars that we have today is a big reason as to why the average, you know, person is so exactly this kind of, this kind of scholarship, this threat, traditional scholarship is the one who should which the, the, the down, down the road, this, this way of decline.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 2283.24s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the type of scholarship prevalent today has contributed to the current decline of the Ummah. He blames scholars for covering up their crimes by creating a narrative of obedience to rulers that contradicts the Quran.  

## So you have to do that, it has to be constructed somewhere, like for example, you are, you have authority in some place, and Technical development that's okay because Muslims are although to cooperate in every way possible, but there's nothing to obey them and the people are not having the right to topple them and get better about that otherwise and, and deny the people the right of accounting them and questioning why is this like this, why is that not a cat.
**Category:** Rulership
**Timestamp:** 2413.92s
**Answer:** The speaker argues against the idea of unconditional obedience to rulers even for the sake of cooperation. He highlights the right of the people to hold their rulers accountable. 

## And Sheikh, what about what is uh, what should our perspective be of you know Scholars who have openly you know either cited or defended regimes, you know you have maybe like albuti or bin buzz, you know like obviously from different sides of the, of the spectrum, But ultimately defended their, you know their country's regimes, they go they'll go back again to Tahari and justify that and everyone referred to the previous Scholars and claimed that's the consensus, I think they totally justify themselves, should we, should we take from those Scholars is it still valid too, no they're not trustworthy, they are not trustworthy no, neither in their in their Memphis structure not, uh, history shows that they are not trustworthy they never benefited, let me give you various examples in major historic Junction, like for example when the printing press was invented in Europe it was actually within samalkan before that, actually in Europe, scholar community at the time decided most likely to, to keep the control and power of the Muslim masses, they decided to declare that this is this is a bidai etc, there was a, there's an injunction to prohibit using this the printing presses uh, for three centuries, including sometimes even the penalty of death, 300 years back, while Europe in 300 years developed science technology millions of people started reading books and that weakened also the control of the church obviously that's what another shares in Europe the people started reading themselves, you don't need to go to a pretty story for you, you read by yourself, you use your mind, use your brain, they prevented mostly from doing that, yeah, one is much later 300 years later, 300 years. 
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 2492.64s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that scholars who defend regimes are not trustworthy and should not be considered reliable sources of knowledge. He gives the example of scholars prohibiting the use of printing presses in the Muslim world, which ultimately stifled scientific and technological development, while Europe flourished.

## Check, do you think a big Pro, a big part of the problem is that we've we've just honestly become a bit too takleady in the sense that we're not willing to like actually explore the, the evidences and explore the information.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 2632.859s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the Ummah has become too reliant on tradition and not willing to engage with the Quran and Hadith critically. He believes that this is a key part of the problem, leading to a stagnation of intellectual development.  

## So Sheikh, you know this uh, these concepts of you know like not being able to speak on something unless you have any Jazz and stuff is this all that's all Bs, that's nothing what, why should we have each other the book of Allah, his address.

**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 4615.62s
**Answer:** The speaker encourages people to directly engage with the Quran and not rely on the interpretations of scholars who may have their own agendas. 

## Are you saying like your perspective is that the idea of whether a scholar is uh comfortable with a ruler or who like is in hangs around with a ruler or endorses, I, I myself tend to, to, to, to, generally, to, to, uh to have uh negative thought about most of these and this I have a hand direct experience like when Buzz seems to be, have a portion of sincerity but obviously he is limited his scope and his understanding, so many of his positions are because of his limitations, limitation because he is ultimately coming from a school of their hobbies and his knowledgeable about about Quran and uh really bad background and also I think that is deficient, s rely on them, we have to go back to the text exactly, most likely that is, is he studied the classics and these Classics are ahmedi etc etc and all of these are stuck with that with the rubbish with the operators, you have to have really uh a rebellion and intellectual Rebellion to go back to that at the beginning it looks like like a, like a tall order, it's really shocking and people will gasp for air or fear like when we started the campaign I guess when we noticed that there's no way we have to break that, we have to and we did not even started, what, what started is that uh materi established that there is a an agent called acetanzil, the Israel Revelation and he made it until the year 73 hijri and after that the answer of the wheel which is a reinterpretation uh through the favor of rulers, the favor of the people, fever of the rich people and so on.

## So let me take him, the brother, the brother of this one protecting the whole or his father, the beautiful father, although I said look he looks very similar, and then the other of the, of the one I would say no, it's not, it's born in my father's bed, and he's my brother, I'm not going to accept to accuse the, the wife or when or the wife of my father to me to become a committed dinner or stay in my father's memory with such health, oh Islam.

**Answer:** The speaker illustrates the application of Islamic law in the context of lineage and inheritance. He explains the Islamic legal principle that a child belongs to the father if born within wedlock, regardless of any doubts about the father's identity. 

##  Sheikh, a lot of these uh you know strange opinions and and Views and you know like almost dodgy dodgy thoughts as you can say are coming up a lot because a lot of these uh Scholars are using you know different asuli points as secondary and third you know types of assault, why don't more Scholars, principle of General possibility. 
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 5461.199s
**Answer:** The speaker questions why more scholars do not adopt the principle of general permissibility. He implies that many scholars rely on secondary and tertiary sources of Islamic law, rather than directly engaging with the Quran. 

##  Let's have a concrete example, so there is no benefit from it at least to see why what has happened, so you know a lot of things in terms of you know you do have some Scholars say we absolutely have to you know uh adhere and follow by you know rulers and regimes today, you know it's very common common thought uh view that we, we discussed that already, talking about the, the principle of general you're very strong on the principle General permissibility, why do more Scholars not adopt that and adhere to, adhere to that, ask them, ask them.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 5483.1s
**Answer:** The speaker further emphasizes the importance of questioning scholars who advocate for unconditional obedience to rulers. He asks why more scholars do not embrace the principle of general permissibility, which emphasizes the Quranic notion that everything is permissible unless explicitly prohibited.

##  Because they didn't analyze it properly and they don't follow that foreign.
**Category:** Scholarship
**Timestamp:** 5531.46s
**Answer:** The speaker attributes the reluctance of scholars to adopt the principle of general permissibility to a lack of proper analysis and adherence to the Quran.  

##  This might be Beyond this topic, but the thing, um, it's a reason, ask him yeah, there's another thing which is quite recent, um, more associated with the with the West, um, and most of them say the minority, um, the idea of navigating differences so basically to put some context to it, a number of notable uh Scholars, uh yasuleleman and all these kind of people they recently published, um, a statement and it was around, sexual identity, gender ethics in Islam and it was kind of, how to tread the line between them, so basically having seeking kind of Common Ground between, um, causes as a minority, and and how to, uh engage with people of different persuasions, you know sexual identities, all that kind of stuff, and kind of coming with a pleasure, but it is there's enough text for that, but this, this is there for example, we know for certainly that we don't, we're not going to endorse any of that stuff, however, in terms of if there's enough text for that, genetics with that, there are, there are, there are certain biological situations, which a baby is born with both organs and things like that, and then now nowadays with the, with the modern science, I know we have the capability of doing the necessary surgical adjustment, we can decide because they even discuss the scholar discuss, at the harm of uh, what is um, now we have scientific solution I, I my suggestion is that this should be treated immediately after birth, it should be, decided which one is really the there will be various genetic issues and so on to that, that can be done with the baby is small and then it doesn't necessarily, this subject so what it is is basically if you look at the quest, you know, this whole idea of arbitrarily deciding, uncertainty no, it's not admitted, no, I'm just discussing it from the root, but so we finish the problem from the road, in that case it should be now we have the facilities to finish the situation, but since the surgical operations and adjusting the diet and and hormones from child, so the child goes goes as a man or woman, that's number one secondly, it should be part of the education that Allah created, a man and woman though or odd cases have been treated, possible treated medically or managed by by law, and the time it was not treated medically, but it is that's clear later on a man are not allowed to behave on the president himself as a woman, this is the major sin, this meaning he's not accepting Allah creation, the same with the woman says, to try to be a woman when you are a man, or try to be a man who you are a woman that's a major sin, this meeting will have a fundamental issue with Creed, you have not been brought up in the correct script I've not been educated that this is how the universe had to decide to test Sports, test man with manhood, this woman with Womanhood, I test both with life, and it's good with evil and evil with good, the fundamental flow there fundamental philosophical flow, that's it period full stop, all this there is nonsense, that imagine in some people who thinks that we're developed from the monkeys just by emergence, there is no God, or the just natural development without any Divine guidance, or any Divine, there's a Divine playground, or in atheism, then atheists will have a problem deciding, or giving it any moral evaluation, you may give it a biological violation, that's nonsensical, if you have all the male organs that you wish to become a woman, why you wish to make a movement, well you have the male organs and so on, I think it's a medical condition even, that even they should conclude on biological grounds that there's a medical condition, maybe there's a problem with the upbringing, I mean there's a sickness in the society, so they try to cure the Sickness by by promoting the sickness and turning it into into a into uh to a normality, that's it, I don't see any anything that Islamic issues clear, yeah I mean there's one thing about it being clear in terms of hook up and half stance, the question is really around how do you engage with these kind of people because if you want I can read it out, it's not what to deal with the people, the people you know, this is how I'm on SO on too, what to do he has no right to go to a clinic and ask to change gender, but it's more around if you're in the in, in the west and you have a common issue, the East what, what to do and how to do with the people so for example you, you're going on a platform and you, you want to, you want you, so for example, you have constitutional rights in the, in the American Constitution, yeah, kind of throw you a lot in with them to kind of get your rights and they get their rights, what's constitutional, what has that to do with the platform, explain more, I can read it to you if you want, no no, meaning you're supposed to uh to allow them in your platform for example, no you are not obliged, in America, these guys they, they, they kind of piggyback off the back of them to get extra to kind of you know like it's almost like lobbying together, uh it should not be, why, why use them, foreign.

**Timestamp:** 5736.96s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the issue of navigating differences in sexual identity and gender ethics within an Islamic context. He clarifies that Islam does not endorse same-sex relationships, but acknowledges that there are biological complexities related to intersex individuals. He suggests that such cases should be treated medically immediately after birth, and that promoting gender fluidity within a Muslim community is a major sin, as it contradicts the Islamic understanding of creation. He also addresses the issue of engaging with LGBTQ+ individuals in Western societies, arguing that while Muslims are not obliged to endorse their lifestyle choices, they should not be subjected to discrimination or violence. 

##  I mean I will, you know, anyway, in our swimming pools we have even men and women say about it anyway so we don't have that issue so anyone who has good is not allowed, it's not acceptable, just because he feels like a woman and declare himself no, if you, if that, if it's true, if you must hear from the West is not in our control, go and remove that male organ, get castrated completely and could be the testicles, you can Flash like a woman, then maybe you will be admitted, it's no problem it's okay, we have to be consistent a symbol, I don't say people made that a big issue, they're trying to transsexual what mean, transsexual you want to change your sex, change it physiologically, fast, really, you're just your feeling, you feel it can't go to hell, we don't care about your feeling, we have also our own feelings, are all restrictions, we just go and remove these organs Catholic yourself completely and say I feel that common, okay I feel orchestrated, that's no problem, then you are not the one who have a sexual desire, and you can mix with them and you can swim with women no problem, is, sexual desire for whatever reason being castrated or whatever it is, organs, that's fine, we don't care about your feeling, some women may feel like a man, but they will never have other penis so they can mix with woman and sit with woman physiologically and physically woman foreign. 
**Category:** Gender Identity
**Timestamp:** 6121.619s
**Answer:** The speaker strongly condemns the idea of transgenderism, arguing that it is a mental disease that should be treated medically, if necessary. He states that people should accept the biological reality of their gender and that feeling like the opposite gender does not justify changing one's physical sex. He also argues that allowing transgender individuals into spaces designed for a specific gender is inappropriate and harmful. 

##  If you insist on that, then remove these organs and so on, I, I don't, I don't see I, I don't see any issue there, other issues are no problem, if someone should I feel a woman and you're just like women are coming in and then we'll say okay, you come with us in the demon session, but be, be aware that I say Allah cursed anyone who had who wishes to be a woman, although he's not a woman, and if it is compulsive, then it may need treatment, who deliberately want to be a woman, someone who's not deliberately is enforced internally, then we say hormonal problems, you need to be studied or maybe bring a psychological problems, maybe he is, he is even not many mentally capable enough to be, to be, uh, to be, uh, to be accountable, and so on, but I don't see what is the issue with platforms and so on, they, these guys especially in America, they got sacked in America, they don't know how to get, they got sucked in there, and they are not unable to get out, that's their problem, they don't know how to deal with the problem on on an obstruction, proper way, this is it all comes out to the same thing in terms of course, they think they think it is, it must be either you are, you kill them or beat them, no it's not true, that's not yeah, even if the message is one of those, that's not me, everything, horses and racing with boys and so on, and then because she was just trying to be like men, and when he healed that, she had that she sees, he never sent anybody who had to punish us, not just people deported them, say you're like yes any woman who want to be like a man, woman, there's only that woman cannot ride horses and then, and but they do but that one more doing it in a way to be a man, if you wanted to, to express itself, that's it, nobody sent there, no punishment, nothing, not even ordering to take the house away, although not to frustrated, this is nothing, but that was very obviously, we have no problems yet, the problem is in people's mind because they do not study the text and they don't go through all of these things thoroughly.
**Category:** Gender Identity
**Timestamp:** 6245.219s
**Answer:** The speaker reiterates his strong opposition to transgenderism, suggesting that those who feel like the opposite gender should undergo physical sex change procedures to align their body with their internal feeling. He dismisses the idea that transgender individuals should be tolerated in Muslim societies or allowed to access spaces designated for a specific gender. 

##  There were audiological cases, they know, we don't have to treat them in and below, and nowadays medicine will help in the treatment and most likely they should be done, it would be prudent to do that from here, before the baby even become conscious, so he grows as a, all these contact cases because either male or other female as much as possible, genetically and and medically with the observation of the parents and so on, and the medical consultation understand, no need to mention that to them, even when they will come out of age and it may need for yourself a various surgeries over several years slowly until everything comes in normal shape on data, how big is that, that's what the university is a spiritual disease, it's a disease of the, the Creed, and your, your vision of your own reality and your place in the universe, but this is not a moment, essentially it goes to metal, the disease that you treat the other believers, juice.

**Timestamp:** 6428.639s
**Answer:** The speaker clarifies his stance on intersex individuals. He suggests that these cases should be treated medically as soon as possible after birth to determine the child's gender based on their biological makeup. He argues that such individuals should be raised according to their biological sex, as the concept of gender fluidity is a spiritual disease that contradicts the Islamic understanding of creation. 

##  Who do not believe in isan may think that is his, um, The Sun Also and so on, maybe, but still does not prevent too much for this purpose, can you, can you, can you seek, can you endorse their rights to have to express themselves. 
**Category:** Freedom of Speech
**Timestamp:** 6508.5s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the issue of freedom of speech and expression, specifically in relation to those who hold beliefs that contradict Islamic teachings, such as those who believe that Jesus is the son of God. While acknowledging that individuals have the right to express their beliefs, he emphasizes that this right does not extend to promoting or endorsing beliefs that contradict the Quran. 

##  What's the rights, that you have the free, that you have the freedom to make it as I show, is that you will actually release and rebel the future, does not mean that you have a right to do you do it against the material, this guy is Allah command you are committing a sin, so it's going to be endorsed, no, so can you tolerate it, say okay that's your Creed, we're not to get involved with it, yeah and and the state can can decide there will be no punishment, there should be no punishment anyway, for that anyway, that's not an issue of punishment anyway, respect the devil, we understand that he's a devil worshiper, and they're machine with us against that, but Israel is the operation against the Palestinian, and Palestine, but there's nothing that we respect the Satanism or acceptance. 
**Category:** Freedom of Speech

**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that while individuals have the freedom of speech and expression, this freedom does not extend to promoting beliefs or actions that contradict the Quran. He clarifies that Muslims should not tolerate beliefs that contradict Islam, such as Satanism, even though they should be respectful of individuals' rights to express themselves.  

##  But you have set motivation according to your belief that making you March against the Zionist entity in Palestine, for their operation against Nebraska, it does not mean that that you can ask us to, to praise the David, or we can ask you to denounce the devil, I don't know, but we denounce the level, and you, you praise him as much as you like, and you would be uh, I don't see the issue there, if you put the issue in the right place, the electricity, the state may you intervene like that, for example like gay marriage, you are employed, like foreign, should be recorded as civil marriages, and some obviously practicing Christian refused to record and so on, and they were regard as disobedient to the state, I think they, they have the right to, to show this away, but the solution for that is the resign for that job, because you are employed by the state, who says no no no a secular state, it has no, no decayed region, the state does not have any religion, but anyway before that even the registering even civil marriages may have even anathema Also, may have been you should have objected to that even before that even before their marriage, but someone could say okay that's essentially approving that whatever he said already has a an asset information, okay, we swallow that, but in principle it should be, all your interpreters, only a registration, it has nothing to do with regarding that as really a marriage properly and so on for the state purpose and the Dooney apparels, then if it's the same like register in the church marriage or the Islamic Management in in, in, in the British system, it's just a registration, just just the administrative technicalities, does not make it Halal Haram or anything like that, if you give it more value than that, you, it's still out of Islamic marriage, it's just a registration, I'm not approving anything, I'm just in the state record, say this is husband and wife according to the, uh, through the SQL State system.

**Timestamp:** 6595.619s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the issue of state-sanctioned civil marriages, particularly in relation to same-sex marriage. He argues that while individuals have the right to marry according to their beliefs, the state's role is simply to register such marriages for administrative purposes. He clarifies that such registration does not constitute an endorsement of the marriage from an Islamic perspective.

**Timestamp:** 6758.94s
**Answer:** The speaker discusses the concept of international law and how it applies to Islamic societies. He argues that while international law should be respected in terms of financial transactions and other non-religious matters, Muslim societies have the right to maintain their own legal system, including the penal code, particularly when it comes to matters of sexual morality.  

##  There was one Muslim man was was found with the whole witness and so on, fornicating with the Christian girl and Ali ordered him to be flogged hundred lashes as they should be and and all that they get to be sent to the Christian, so they'll give her to the people, they would manage it according to Daddy. 
**Category:** Law
**Timestamp:** 6791.96s
**Answer:** The speaker provides a historical example of how Islamic law was applied in a multi-cultural context. He explains that even though a Muslim man committed fornication with a Christian woman, he was punished according to Islamic law, but the woman was handed over to her community to handle according to their own laws.

**Answer:** The speaker distinguishes between punishments in Islamic law that are applied for public offense, such as murder or theft, and those that are specific to religious matters, such as fornication. He argues that punishments for religious offenses are only applicable to Muslims, as non-Muslims have their own legal systems. He also reiterates his condemnation of transgenderism, highlighting the Islamic concept of gender as being determined by biology, not personal feelings.

44.96s:  for this is enough for them to
48.48s:  forsake which they think it's a good
50.719s:  offer it's a good pressure on that on
52.6s:  the other hand the American are trying
54.28s:  it seems to be Netanyahu the moment they
55.84s:  bring something Netanyahu comes but they
57.84s:  don't have the dignity or they are
60.0s:  plotting something else and to come
62.12s:  forward say Hamas accepted nany is
64.68s:  refusing because if they say that the
66.08s:  people say okay so what you're going to
68.0s:  do now stop the say you you you accept
72.2s:  or we lock away your your even there was
75.52s:  a rumor that they offered to Hamas just
78.04s:  give us the American those who American
81.079s:  I think they six or seven or something a
82.799s:  limited number and said for what in
86.0s:  exchange of
87.88s:  what maybe they want to ex change for
90.36s:  for money or something no the minimum
92.399s:  Exchange in that case will be okay we
94.2s:  give you these six provided that you
96.799s:  publicly announce that all weapon
98.84s:  delivered to Israel and ammunition and
101.0s:  so on is stopped just stop it and leave
103.52s:  the rest land for the negotiation and we
105.719s:  give you the seven
108.399s:  guys but this is almost impossible for
111.04s:  these guys to
112.36s:  do because I'm still I'm getting more
114.96s:  and more convinced that the whole
116.2s:  slauter in Gaza and so on is not the
118.039s:  doing of of of Natan is the doing of
120.84s:  Biden ahead of Nat and I mentioned that
123.759s:  before let me stress it
127.8s:  again.com Biden is behind is not is not
131.48s:  only have complicity in the genocide
134.8s:  he's the one order the genocide because
137.12s:  in the we have on record as stated by
139.64s:  Max blumental from from The gry Zone uh
143.84s:  website and he's a very well informed
147.12s:  and very very very thoroughly investig
150.16s:  journalist he dug out what happened when
154.12s:  Bean came to America uh to to be
157.48s:  interviewed and discussed with him with
159.12s:  the with the Foreign Affairs uh
161.84s:  Committee of of the the
164.8s:  Senate and that committee was the people
168.28s:  were seven or eight one of them was
170.0s:  Biden I think it was his F time that was
172.4s:  82 or 83 and all the Senators except
176.08s:  Biden said to to
178.599s:  rebuke p
180.64s:  at the time the Congress has some some
182.36s:  Clouts and they have some men there at
183.959s:  least for some manhood say what you did
186.68s:  there in Beirut is a catastrophic you
188.879s:  you you destabilize the area you did not
191.319s:  succeed anything and then Lebanon is a
193.599s:  very sensitive place because mostly they
195.319s:  are Christian and it will just
197.68s:  destabilize the area and does not serve
199.4s:  Israel You're endangering Israel
201.319s:  destabilizing the area and endangering
203.2s:  in the first place American interest we
205.08s:  don't want instability you want peace so
207.959s:  obviously the American want peace and
209.439s:  stability
210.28s:  not because they love the people eyes
212.239s:  are beautiful black andc mascara no no
215.64s:  because they want to loot it and for
217.319s:  looting getting the oil and getting the
219.599s:  resources you don't want to have be
221.519s:  fighting every day that doesn't work
223.2s:  this way that's not the way Empires work
225.4s:  they want everyone submissive and paying
226.92s:  his taxes and money being collected
229.4s:  nicely that's what they want so they
231.12s:  don't want headache and
233.12s:  and and they rebuked him all of them
235.519s:  rebuked him for that except one this one
238.72s:  is a young man Joe Biden that's in 1982
242.04s:  83 he said I disagree with the honorable
244.879s:  members of this committee Etc I think
247.959s:  you Mr Bean you failed to do the right
250.48s:  way the right action you should have
252.2s:  killed more women and children cuz in
255.64s:  that campaign they tried tried as much
258.4s:  as possible to avoid killing women and
260.28s:  sh they did but they avoided you did not
263.199s:  you did not kill enough women and
264.52s:  children you would have them been more
266.56s:  Victorious and successful so this man is
268.919s:  a genocidal from from that day so I
270.919s:  think when he arrived after October 7
273.919s:  and embraced Netanyahu most likely he
276.52s:  told listen and those guys finish the
279.52s:  problem this was a Hyer opportunity
282.16s:  to yes yes uption good news I am full in
288.16s:  compliance with that and possibly even
290.16s:  in the meeting with the with the
291.28s:  ministers because he met with the
292.6s:  cabinet and met for several for
294.759s:  relatively long time discussing with
296.32s:  them various things clarifying various
298.919s:  promises with them and so on most likely
301.36s:  he also encouraged to complete the job
303.6s:  and just anate the or kick them to to to
307.12s:  S I'm just speculating I was not there
310.12s:  and I am 100% sure that Netanyahu will
312.88s:  not miss the opportunity but this man is
315.759s:  a snake and his misers to make a record
318.759s:  voice record of that so he's keeping the
320.96s:  record anytime Biden dares to put
324.8s:  pressure with come on you are the one
326.68s:  who command us I have the record you
329.4s:  just shut up that's my guess it sound
333.199s:  outlandish but that's my guess that's
335.199s:  commenting on that so that's that's not
337.68s:  getting anywhere but it is they claim ah
340.96s:  Brink will go there again and so on
342.919s:  Hamas said clearly that's we the third
345.52s:  of July final agreement is that what we
347.6s:  stick to it anything else is a waste of
349.44s:  time that's that's not acceptable and
352.16s:  then also ham issued a clear communicate
354.96s:  that any attempt to free hostages by any
357.8s:  military action will will will result in
359.68s:  the hostage being killed we will execute
361.72s:  them right away finish that's it now no
364.68s:  no more nice man we have been nice man
366.68s:  super nice man super nice man super nice
369.16s:  man with the result that the pre the
371.96s:  action before last ended in Kill 237
376.919s:  palestini inent in in in the camp is not
380.0s:  the instument of killing three hostages
383.16s:  and to free for that's not acceptable
385.199s:  anymore you will get only people in
387.68s:  coffins if you want to be in coffins try
390.039s:  it so that's that's where the situation
393.479s:  there the West Bank seem to be putting
397.039s:  more effort in the West Bank the four
399.24s:  days almost continuous fighting they
402.44s:  claim the operation is over but today I
405.56s:  think today morning some uh some hot
408.68s:  blooded
410.24s:  uh uh truck driver coming from the
413.199s:  crossing the standard Crossing not the
415.039s:  crossing where the supply comes to
416.759s:  Israel from the emirat that's another
418.56s:  Crossing The Crossing with the with a
420.96s:  supply uh which someone should block
423.24s:  somehow but until now nobody had the
425.039s:  courage or it is so protected with
427.12s:  viciously
429.199s:  armed thugs of of King Abdullah that's
432.84s:  the one just Hussein King Hussein bridge
436.36s:  that one which the incident happened is
438.199s:  Kama bridge where the famous B of Alama
441.12s:  and the V of Alama nearby there and this
443.039s:  is the main way it seems to be some
445.479s:  truck driver or truck Co driver where
449.52s:  was armed with a with a with a with a
451.24s:  pistol and then when he arrived to the
454.24s:  checkpoint he just disembarked and shot
457.479s:  three people killed him and he got
459.479s:  killed I this action shows this I would
463.039s:  say clearly it is not an organized
465.56s:  action it's a single person that's
467.4s:  number one secondly it shows it is a
470.4s:  reaction a good it shows shows shows
473.52s:  devotion shows willingness to sacrifice
476.319s:  and so on but it is not it is a good
479.199s:  action
480.199s:  from Shar Point know you are are Liberty
483.639s:  to fight the enemies of Allah and kill
485.08s:  them course they are killing Muslim they
486.44s:  are fighting now now it's a state of war
488.12s:  no doubt about that but the problem it
490.039s:  is from a tactical point of view from
492.8s:  effect I
494.599s:  think saying don't say it's
497.159s:  misguided recording
503.0s:  prison analyze it thoroughly and see how
505.759s:  can I do an action which at least not
507.759s:  only three I can get 30 maybe because
510.72s:  you are more valuable than these zon SS
513.919s:  so if you are going to sacrifice
515.919s:  yourself because such an action will end
517.64s:  most likely being getting killed no that
519.839s:  what that then at least
522.8s:  have have have a vision to have to have
525.76s:  a a bigger number or or deign things
528.68s:  much more think about it or organize it
531.64s:  not just casual thinking but people what
534.12s:  they are they are very emotional Muslims
536.56s:  are willing to sacrifice but they are
539.519s:  not yet to up the level of of the mental
542.279s:  sophistication tactical they did not
544.959s:  they did not yet get to the level of
546.76s:  Hamas see how Hamas worked since 2014
551.079s:  the inflammation there until now how
552.8s:  many years 9 years they were working
555.839s:  patiently and slowly and so on you have
559.2s:  to have patient you have to plan Pap but
561.24s:  nevertheless symbolic symbolic symbol
563.959s:  wise the action is will have great
565.959s:  repercussions is will make an incursion
568.839s:  they stop the Bridge they tortured and
571.12s:  mistreated the truck drivers who has
573.399s:  nothing to do with anything and they
575.6s:  delay the people which increase more
578.2s:  hostility and so is again they are as us
581.68s:  digging their own they not digging
585.04s:  only deing it more and more and more
588.72s:  alert so it will have good effects but
592.12s:  even if you think the Maj the the the
595.0s:  Strategic effects and the doctrinal
597.079s:  effects are important also the Tactical
599.64s:  should not be neglected we want to have
601.72s:  those tactics which cause the enemy more
605.04s:  pain and more suffering than otherwise
608.519s:  in addition obviously should see the
610.079s:  Strategic purpose and should the dictor
613.24s:  purpose but the tactics should not to
615.56s:  ignore in just tactic and is just
617.32s:  jumping in in in a butter situation
620.88s:  self-sacrificing without without having
623.8s:  such an effect on the enemy or such
625.92s:  protective result for the for the for
628.16s:  your own side
630.04s:  then it is the is wasteful use of
632.8s:  resources because your life your
636.04s:  en your body your life Staying Alive is
640.56s:  a resource
642.959s:  our to attack the enemies of so that's
645.839s:  my comment on that anyone listening in
648.079s:  Palestine hopefully and and around and
650.16s:  in Jordan should make thoughtful
652.519s:  thinking what to do and just not just
654.76s:  aaction just just a pistol or something
657.72s:  like that think a little bit more
659.72s:  creative and more expanded and discuss
662.6s:  with muah see what you can do analyze
665.36s:  things better and it's better to work
667.72s:  with with a group and so than being
669.839s:  alone be able to direct for
673.12s:  examp
676.0s:  with rebellious and sincere part of they
680.399s:  will be able to get you to do something
682.24s:  which more effective yeah Etc and so
686.56s:  yeah maybe it's more effective if you
688.399s:  would have a with let's say they are
691.16s:  local deeply ingrained in and they have
694.079s:  some resources in the other side they if
696.68s:  you raise with them they they may have
699.24s:  something use you for example as a truck
701.68s:  driver in some smuggling some electronic
704.76s:  devices it's much more important than
707.079s:  can for example so example example
709.44s:  example examp I'm just mentioning those
710.959s:  examples just as an advice don't P just
713.56s:  trigger happy think about what this
716.12s:  tactic will bring how it Ser the
718.36s:  strategy and how the
720.56s:  doctrine yeah so that's one what else is
724.6s:  there yeah and obviously the they they
727.44s:  killed various mujah in Janine Camp as
729.72s:  usual they killed the son of Zakaria
733.839s:  zabidi his son Muhammad 20 21 years old
737.399s:  the Zakaria himself is is detained and
739.639s:  he's the top of the list of the dete of
742.8s:  of the Palestinian which Hamas insist
744.639s:  they must be released Zakaria zabidi
747.079s:  maranti is at the top and Hamas insist
750.8s:  they must be released and no
754.0s:  way any release of Palestinian prisoners
757.639s:  will be accepted without these two and
759.56s:  others like at list to five six
761.32s:  important persons so they uh the killing
764.76s:  of his son and targeting him in a car
766.839s:  with an Israeli uh drone um obviously an
771.519s:  attempt to demoralize his father and
773.92s:  break his heart but most likely it will
775.76s:  fail it will back fire against as usual
777.88s:  all what they are doing alhamdulillah is
779.16s:  is misguided and is backfire against
781.04s:  them all that they can do is do more
783.199s:  pain and bloodshed that's it that's all
785.12s:  what they can do and the more they shed
786.92s:  blood and the Miracles for the muah and
789.36s:  other Spain and the Palestinian the
790.92s:  Muslims the more they dig themselves
792.8s:  deeper so don't Despair and be upset
795.44s:  about that yeah we cannot re ourselves
798.56s:  from being being sad and having the pain
801.519s:  but keep always the over over all vision
806.199s:  of the reality in your
807.959s:  mind okay old vision of on your mind so
811.399s:  that's it what else is there yeah there
814.0s:  was
815.04s:  also from from Yemen we don't hear
818.24s:  anything concerning their their their
820.839s:  their retaliation I my best guess is
823.44s:  that they may synchronize with the Irani
826.04s:  retaliation and then they most likely
828.839s:  they have the the legitimate the
831.12s:  legitimacy to address to attack the
834.079s:  refinery in haa and one or two or
837.279s:  several major po generation facility
839.959s:  because is did the same to them so they
841.92s:  are at Liberty to retaliate in equal
843.68s:  measures okay so but for that you need
846.839s:  like cover of uavs or something else so
849.079s:  it may be a synchronized action between
851.72s:  them and either hisbah or Iran because
854.68s:  the distance does not allow to send UAV
857.279s:  to to do the divertive action nor it's
859.8s:  possible to send sheep Rockets to the
862.0s:  Sheep Rockets are only 100 150 maximum
865.48s:  most of the Rockets used by hisbah for
868.32s:  diverting attention
869.56s:  and the recent action where K and things
873.72s:  like that and these are only 10 15 20 km
876.959s:  the main purpose of that was just to
879.0s:  engage so can fly under that and this
883.199s:  they diday respon all information
886.639s:  affirms that they hit the unit 8,200 and
890.079s:  they think the the commander of the unit
892.199s:  has been killed in this attack and many
894.12s:  others and the building have been
895.68s:  suffered major destruction because I
898.48s:  think 60
899.6s:  you UAV or drones have arrived suicide
903.24s:  drones and they demolish the building
905.24s:  considerably so I think many many people
908.839s:  of this spying organization including
910.68s:  the the the the boss the commander has
913.88s:  been eliminated which I think is a
915.92s:  reasonable retaliation for
918.16s:  auk so that's that's essentially what's
920.639s:  going on and
922.959s:  yeah and we're waiting to see what what
926.519s:  develops further
929.44s:  and uh any moment some some something
932.519s:  major may happen from now on because
934.92s:  clearly the the Seas
937.639s:  fire discussion seems to be have got
940.56s:  stuck and there's nothing indicating
943.0s:  that will be
947.12s:  unstuck we'll do answer in yeah
**Answer:**  The speaker believes the Americans are deceptive and are trying to gain time and keep the hope of a ceasefire alive, despite knowing that the Iranians will not forgive the assassination of their leader and will seek revenge. The speaker is also critical of the Americans, claiming they are only interested in the region's resources and stability for their own benefit. 

##  What is the speaker's view on the recent killings in Gaza?

**Category:**  Gaza

116.2s:  slauter in Gaza and so on is not the
118.039s:  doing of of of Natan is the doing of
120.84s:  Biden ahead of Nat and I mentioned that
123.759s:  before let me stress it
127.8s:  again.com Biden is behind is not is not
131.48s:  only have complicity in the genocide
134.8s:  he's the one order the genocide because
137.12s:  in the we have on record as stated by
139.64s:  Max blumental from from The gry Zone uh
143.84s:  website and he's a very well informed
147.12s:  and very very very thoroughly investig
150.16s:  journalist he dug out what happened when
154.12s:  Bean came to America uh to to be
157.48s:  interviewed and discussed with him with
159.12s:  the with the Foreign Affairs uh
161.84s:  Committee of of the the
164.8s:  Senate and that committee was the people
168.28s:  were seven or eight one of them was
170.0s:  Biden I think it was his F time that was
172.4s:  82 or 83 and all the Senators except
176.08s:  Biden said to to
178.599s:  rebuke p
180.64s:  at the time the Congress has some some
182.36s:  Clouts and they have some men there at
183.959s:  least for some manhood say what you did
186.68s:  there in Beirut is a catastrophic you
188.879s:  you you destabilize the area you did not
191.319s:  succeed anything and then Lebanon is a
193.599s:  very sensitive place because mostly they
195.319s:  are Christian and it will just
197.68s:  destabilize the area and does not serve
199.4s:  Israel You're endangering Israel
201.319s:  destabilizing the area and endangering
203.2s:  in the first place American interest we
205.08s:  don't want instability you want peace so
207.959s:  obviously the American want peace and
209.439s:  stability
210.28s:  not because they love the people eyes
212.239s:  are beautiful black andc mascara no no
215.64s:  because they want to loot it and for
217.319s:  looting getting the oil and getting the
219.599s:  resources you don't want to have be
221.519s:  fighting every day that doesn't work
223.2s:  this way that's not the way Empires work
225.4s:  they want everyone submissive and paying
226.92s:  his taxes and money being collected
229.4s:  nicely that's what they want so they
231.12s:  don't want headache and
233.12s:  and and they rebuked him all of them
235.519s:  rebuked him for that except one this one
238.72s:  is a young man Joe Biden that's in 1982
242.04s:  83 he said I disagree with the honorable
244.879s:  members of this committee Etc I think
247.959s:  you Mr Bean you failed to do the right
250.48s:  way the right action you should have
252.2s:  killed more women and children cuz in
255.64s:  that campaign they tried tried as much

## What was the speech Hass Al Sal gave? 
**Category:** Speech Analysis

0.04s : There's not very much to update except the following. There was, there was a speech by by Hass Al Sal that's is the new title I gave to him for I know this may be upsetting for many people who trusted and believed in in hisbah and so on and he mentioned previous victories of the Palestinian, the great stand of the people of Yemen, maybe he mentioned the Communist Party of China, I don't know. Anyway it did not solve the problem because the problem was his speech a week ago, 10 days ago. 

The speaker is referring to a speech by Hass Al Sal, a leader of a political group. He describes the speech as being focused on highlighting previous victories and struggles of Palestinian and Yemeni people, potentially even referencing the Communist Party of China, but this is unclear. The speaker says that this speech does not address the main issue at hand, which was brought up in a previous speech by Hass Al Sal.


## What is the problem with the speech?
**Category:** Political Analysis

26.4s :  He clearly made it clear that whatever happened in Gaza, even if it's annihilated, he has nothing to do with that. He will be fighting for Lebanon. 

The speaker criticizes Hass Al Sal's speech, specifically his statement that he will be fighting for Lebanon while disassociating himself from what is happening in Gaza. This is considered a problematic stance as the situation in Gaza requires solidarity, not disengagement.


## What are the arguments against Hass Al Sal's stance?
**Category:** Political Analysis

43.0s: Only some people argue this is rational and Leon should not be involved in this war, and it's not opportunistic now to spread the war. That's all fine. That's, I have no problem. Maybe maybe he has an argument in that sense, but the problem, my problem is not this. My problem is that Iran were involved with the Syria regime in killing hundreds of thousands of Syrian. Their hand is full of blood with the argument that we are confronting Israel and we're doing that for Muslims and for Palestine. That's my point now when the situation comes where you have to stand at least remain silent, keep as a boogy man to the world to America and Israel, just don't mention anything, don't say what you are going to do. I'm just, sorry, you fail to do that. So how to understand that bloodshed in Syria? We have to interpret it like what?

The speaker outlines the arguments against Hass Al Sal's stance on the situation in Gaza and Lebanon. Firstly, some argue that it's irrational to not be involved in the conflict in Gaza and that spreading the war to Lebanon is opportunistic. However, the speaker's primary concern is the hypocrisy of those who condemn Israel while simultaneously engaging in the bloodshed in Syria, arguing that their hand is full of blood. They suggest that if you're truly against Israel, then stand against them even if it means remaining silent and not taking action.  This hypocrisy makes it hard to interpret their actions in Syria as anything but sectarian or power-driven, not genuine support for Palestine. 


## What is the speaker's assessment of Hass Al Sal's speech?
**Category:** Speech Analysis

186.599s : That fig leaf has been torn away. The speech yesterday was it yesterday? Yeah yesterday, did not change anything. He mentioned the great the heroism of the Iranian, and the heroism of this, the hero of this. We know that there may be heroes. We're not discussing that. Maybe he mentioned, I just said the Communist Party of China just as a joke maybe the commun of China. That's not the issue. You claimed and killed 100,000 of Syrian under the claim that these are undermining the front which confront Israel, the resistant front. Now the time for you to be a resistant front and you failed. That's my point. Close the chapter until he proved otherwise, leave him aside, let's go back to what's happening. 

The speaker concludes that Hass Al Sal's speech was ineffective and did not change anything. He argues that the speech was full of empty rhetoric, referencing heroes and the Communist Party of China, while failing to address the real issue. Specifically, he highlights the hypocrisy of claiming to be against Israel while also engaging in the killing of Syrians. The speaker suggests that this exposes the true motives of those who support Hass Al Sal, and that they are not genuinely concerned with supporting Palestine. 


## What is the current battle situation in Gaza?
**Category:** Military Analysis

228.56s :  Yes, the suffering of the civilian in and and the genocide committed by by the Is, Is, very clear. But according to the best information from certain underground sources but also American analyst sources, because there, there are continuous analysis in the CNN and so on, relying on satellite photos and information, some American analysts have access from from their friends in the American forces and other sources, although they obvious not at Liberty to give all information in detail or the sources. But it seems to be the following until now there's no real battle in Gaza yet. There there were two, we could say two, uh two battles maybe two, only two, one few days ago in which commanding general or a colonel, a commander of a division was killed with his secretary and so on in in one meraba used, obviously as a headquarter, and a good number of tanks have been annihilated, maybe hundreds. So kill this one, and yesterday about 20 plus, uh uh uh, tractors and things that called Alat, machinery, machinery of the war, both tanks and soldier car and so on, and a good number of solders have been also annihilated by by in a in a battle of several hours with Hamas. So until now barely barely any real battle has happened and they have barely penetrated anywhere in the back street and the ti, they have the Main Street going to hospital. By the way, they destroyed the shifa hospital generator, so there's no electricity there, so that everyone will die there who needs electricity and they are at the seaside. That's all what they have penetrating deep in the street, fight. They will most likely, mytim, they will be annihilated. Until now the total count of the American analyst and other analyst is at least 160 U machines and tanks and so on and the number of soldier this estimate, differ but the minimum estimation by rece serious analyst is in baz itself, 800 to a 1,000, beside the over thousand killed outside on SE. So the battle is way ahead, away, far away from being being over and as a matter of fact I think yesterday or this morning Hamas issued certain conditions for the seed fire, so they're making conditions there are such you know, situation that they are making conditions. So the situation is not bad and maybe Allah will make it so that beside exposing, and the other in Iran and elsewhere they are exposed while the the the poist Shia Islamic resistance in Iraq, they, they seem to be clearly independent from Iran and they seem to be clearly acting on their own impulse, Islamic impulse and also the am many, they have proven themselves although they can not participate very much but they stand is very clear that they are honest that they, so the demonstration which were in the millions and millions saying death to Is, America is not just a slogan, it's sincere and the same with the Shia underground or the Shia population in Iraq, not the leadership and not the Iranian factions, so we have that alhamdulillah. 

The speaker describes the current situation in Gaza as not yet a full-fledged battle, with only two major engagements having occurred. One resulted in the death of a high-ranking commander and a significant number of tanks, while the other saw the destruction of machinery and a large number of soldiers. Despite this, the speaker believes that the battle is far from over and that Israeli forces have not been able to penetrate deep into Gaza. He also mentions that Hamas has issued ceasefire conditions, suggesting that they are in control of the situation and not in a desperate position.


## What is the speaker's overall analysis of the situation in Gaza?
**Category:** Military Analysis

852.0s: But it's look, it looks good. It looks good, it's not as bad, and the test came for for Hass in parenthesis or without parenthesis and he failed the test, that's it. And Iran the same thing, the test they failed. Well, they did not fail the test. The the Islamic forces in Iraq, they did not fail the test. They are opposite, they are they are forcing themselves and asserting themselves and the Irani, the the the Islamic resistance in in in in Iraq, they said clearly what we are doing is not is not related toaz directly in that sense. Yes, it's in support of, but the the target is to get America out of the area, out of Iraq, completely fighting America. This may be supportive for that was going in Gaza, but in Gaza, we can't do very much. It's too far away yet but here we are, doing and they, and they were true to their word and they increasing according to their means. Their means are relatively limited. They don't have the means of otherwise they would have swept Americans long ago. 

The speaker believes that the situation in Gaza is not as bad as it seems, with Hamas showing resilience and holding its own against Israeli forces. This contrasts with the situation of Hass Al Sal, who is seen as having failed the test and becoming weak. The speaker acknowledges that the Islamic forces in Iraq have also passed the test, demonstrating their independence and their focus on fighting against America. While they cannot directly intervene in Gaza, they remain committed to their mission and will continue to push for America's departure from Iraq.

That's the first level actually there must be some other terms higher than that, it must be more more complex than that, and those terms will undermine and annihilate any possibility, so meaning the theory is that not that God was no no, it doesn't need to step in, it's impossible that such an invest cannot be, it may be not even creatable when first place it has to be a little bit more sophisticated and complex than that, and that one cannot be, there's no way you can't go back in time, that's take that from me and the guarantee by the value of the Quran that we're going to see of necessity of reason now that's not although the way gradually Express it is a little bit enjoyable literacy.

## 10322.84s 
**Question:** I wonder if there's like we can make like an an absolute cause for it because it it doesn't seem feasible so so so from the Islamic perspective if if a Muslim Muslim he he he argues for example for homosexuality or he he he calls for homosexuality or or even worse than that for example mocking the religion mocking God mocking the prophet he's he's he's immediately C because Allah said no I'm let me finish let me finish let me that was not last question last question does the state do anything with that yes yes so so here so here just let me clarify that if this Muslim he he he just committed apostasy because because he called for something that contradicts Islam we need to check has he left the community we discussed that this is challenging the the order by or or or de facto either de facto being a warrior yeah absolutely absolutely so so I mentioned that but that was not the question yes I'm just clarifying because I'm going to I'm going to go to the to those who non-believers who who who who who who who who who want to who want to argue for homosexuality or for example anything not warranted by Islam I'll just I'll go I'll go there but for for the Muslim who's um who who who who committed apostasy for calling for something that contradicts Islam depart from the community or Depart of community absolutely there has to be a trial for him at least whether he departed or not departed so we can check that's something El that's not that's because he made an act of War that's something else I see I see okay okay it's not the M expression itself I I understand in such a way that is challenging the order or reporting the community that's something else otherwise he commit fine if you if if you decide you not the state to to to say he should not inherit from us you go and file to the court and get get a ruling that heated and he cannot inherit yeah so in any case there has to be a trial for him that has nothing to do state stepping in and preventing him from expressing himself it's from the Judiciary System the that's the judici will not prevent him from exing but make the ruling related to him became an apost is not related to freedom of expression Freedom ex that you can exess whatever you want without the state either sensoring you in advance or preventing you from saying it or punishing you for that saying for that for the saying that's it the other thing something else I see because because let's move for example to the nonbelievers who want to say something abominable against Islam or Muslims for for example let's take the and let's take this example of um of this Jewish Arabi who who who said that Allah isting in the Quran yeah so here Abu Bakr he went to him and he argued that if there wasn't no Covenant between us Muslims and you uh jewi you will be put to death so it seems to me and and and and then no no no no but but he went to the messenger Allah and he rebuked Abu Bak no no prophet he met he did not say anything he did but he did not do anything to him that's the pration when do you got to do with him yes so my argument is that the Covenant the Covenant saved Sav theck no no no they didn't say the say if he repeats he has broken the Covenant he can repeat it and still he's in the Covenant yeah so so so because the Covenant is binding he can say whatever he wants now now let's take for example a group of people who are out of the state who who don't have um a Le a covenant or an an agreement with Muslim if for example let's take Sweden like they have like a neutral status with with an Islamic entity but ABAB I know what you are shooting for if the one in the domain is if saying that does not break the Covenant the one outside is not having a covenant are not breaking anything unless it's an act of War yeah so so that's my argument is that because because we don't have a covenant for example if that would have been an to court just by expressing this statement yeah it would have broken the Covenant so how can we War for someone outside and this is an instigation to war yeah because because we don't we don't have a CO a covenant with the other state and the outside domain yes canot prohibit or do anything unless it is an instigation of War then he is instigating for war he's doing an act of War that's something else but wouldn't be wouldn't it be considered an act of War why should it be considered if this one is not breaking the Covenant because it s acted War for one inside it would break the Covenant oh yeah yeah you are going in circle we talking what the state does in preventing it from being expressed and after ex punishing it for the expression not the result of the expression that he is excluded from inheritance or this or this or cannot marry your sister that's something else that's according to your ruling or the judicial ruling let's for example take aaf you know this man is aaf but he nominal Muslim he comes to to ask the the the hand of the sister or the daughter of your neighbor in that case you can't go to NE say listen I know this guy he's secretly a CF is's your your daugh your daughter or sister is too too pure and clean to be married to that one reject him that's it that's all that you have nothing else so the state cannot take any step further than that no unless it's some Judiciary issue related like inheritance marriage things like that yeah yeah yeah anything lower than capital punishment yeah or or for example husband and wife apostas and something KU then the state may may save the children because they the children belong to them but the children were born in Islam now they apiz they their has been lifted by apost take the kids they can't utter what they ever say until yeah yeah yeah naturally yes the question of was can the state do something for that expiration no not for that expiration but they apostas they can't blubber what they say until as long as not a declaration instigation of war but the kids now born as as with them when they were Muslims but they and registered as Muslim born they cannot be left in their custody they may be until six years then after that take them away so the statement or the argument ofak against this jei is is wrong isn't it when he said that it's not it's not wrong it's not wrong yeah but because but but didn't not say if he repeats it that he breaks the Covenant so so it doesn't break the Covenant so abak is a mistaken somehow he thought that Covenant is protecting him from this or I don't know what what abak thought butak is not relevant relevant the M did did he order him not to repeat if he repeat who should be killed no I see I see I see what Allah commented did fin yeah finally Professor from the Practical perspective because because because from my understanding is that if you open if you open wide freedom of speech you will have many silly people coming like this who who ultimately does let him let him let him until he reach the level of instigating War yeah one question we've got in the UK Professor but he is affecting H and and making people that's the mistake that said Allah also affecting because hundred of thousands of people are are seeing him and not seeing the H you have to take care that the H is being perpetuated the the the the duty of the state then to get other people respond to him they can't come to State prevent him or or or punish him no no respond to him here he's the platform in the that giving you enough time in in television and so on yeah in the state television if the state can own television on Islam and so on which is question mark by the way but assume that they have to give the other point of view obiously better otherwise they are condoning that there's a question about the state itself Dr adim he Dr IIM he presented like a better solution for that he said whomever made an makes an outrageous Claim about religion he he must be Tri in in front of a jury just to question his intent to bring a backup for his proof you know like like like you would do with any that's not a good solution how how do you do that with the Jews who claim that that they say about that's all gone in history you see my proof is what the Quran Reve so we don't believe in your Quran it's so he says like like you do in any other profession for example anyone who claims he's a doctor and puts his hand a patient he need no no that's something else that's something else because this is a profession this something present like for example if you insult someone of adultery he can sue you and the usual process goes but if he s someone in history of adultery like maram it's just gone cannot be sued now will be finished be the state question of R is reallyy can the state put a limit I told him was the limit for the state yeah you are confusing with and yeah yeah yeah and ignoring what the messenger of Allah is doing taking ab and foret M of Allah the same with the when when when when say send to the the tribes they will get you their heads that's no problem they say the repeat it again they are compan publicly they are companion and they monaf but that but that's for a capital punishment how about like anything lower than that for example imprisonment or paying chares this case was in front of him he did not do anything of [Music] that yeah because when you think about it in the practical sense no no because it do in the pr we are used over centuries of this rubbish since the time of of of mua centy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if you look at it carefully it's from the time of mu ESS was that yeah indeed the following story has been narrated that that Abu sufyan went to to said is anyone here because he was blind and later his blind in eyes after being blind in heart for all his life and then he said said no nobody say say listen there's there's no hell on of paradise it is just a kingdom play with it like you play with with a ball like kids with ball andman screamed at him and kicked him out okay a lat scholar said I'm not be amazed about AB sufyan saying something like so he said sufyan is worthy of saying something but I'm amazed about not striking his neck and say was right that's you don't strike because he's following the and that's he following the of the messenger of Allah you just kick him out of your place that you have the right in in your presence as head of state or in house you can't tell people go out I don't want to listen to you that's your right that's all what he has nothing else he did exactly so this latest scholar is in the mentality I don't say like your mentality but stuck in that in the tradition which they so the Jews and Christian having conferen in the it's a heretic burn the heretic put him on the steak Christian is not what what M Allah has did all his life nor nor what the Quran indicate of course we're not we're not talking about those who instigate others for war against against Muslims War yeah that's that's went and instigated qur for war encouraging him to wage war against Muhammad finally finally here's a here's a practical Point like we need to consider in our discussion what about governments for example the government of France like we saw from maon he encourages magazines that would mock Prophet Muhammad or he he would allow banners against mocking Muslims and so on while he is staying to analyze if if when he bans anything against Jews and or other no that's is it relevant to study it is it is it really an act of War what would be the ruling in this case is it an an act of it has to be analyzed I don't think we bother our head with such exoteric case I would say in that case you terate relation with them terminate all commerci relation with them if you are serious and threaten them with with with War action see what happens they will come Pi like he came the moment we started boycotting he came Bing in Al jaaz saying oh because we have to comply with the law and so on yeah yeah and think okay comply with your law and also with the European Court said this is not covered by because it instigate internal strife in the society you as a state should keep the peace between the various factions absolutely car someone to insult the religion of others you are endangering the peace that's what the European Court of Human Rights said endangering the peace and the social cohesion is not matter of freedom of exibition yeah danger essentially you are you're putting the conditions for civil strife and bloodshed in that Reas I think that's very rational argument of the of of the the same you can apply this a very reasonable argument I see I see I see because done such a provocative not say we don't believe he's a messenger we have a conference about refuting the messenger of Muhammad fine we sent our delegatory and show you that you are wrong and bring our evidence that's no problem but using it in such a mockery way is instigating and and mocking and so on is definitely uh um is definitely uh abusive and instigate civil strife and may instigate people to start war and things like that then another issue is another crime then not just expr itself yeah encouraged by government not by individuals or by individual doing like for example that magazine is s for examp magazine is Attack Attack the Trinity we know the Trinity is false but they show like three persons doing sodomy to each other this is disgusting that's not the way sity is nonsense or or or or imagination the myth is not a reality but you're not three person of TR doing Soom to each other that's disgusting that's offensive should be punished because it offended the feeling of people and could cause it actually in the case of because Muslim are sensitive not like Christian now they have the declined completely they it ended that someone got his neck cut it should not have come to them without the French government committing that so she responsible for the blood of this guy being killed does not mean that the guy guy who killed him is right or wrong but they are responsible they instigate and if you instigate something like that you have a backlash and you have Bloodshed and your job as a government is to keep the

**Answer:** The speaker asks the Professor for a practical perspective on freedom of speech in the context of Muslims living in the West.  The Professor clarifies that the state's responsibility is to maintain peace and order, and that intervention is only justified when speech directly incites violence or threatens public safety.  The Professor emphasizes that the responsibility of individuals to respond to offensive speech is critical, and that the state's role is not to censor or punish speech itself, but to protect public order.

**Question:** I just want to ask you know um is there from the text is there any prohibition so imagine someone wants to become a citizen um non-muslim or want citizenship um can we put down in the stipulation that not to insult just to avoid all this hassle of someone wants to insult Prophet Isam then this is um prohibited or is that not allowed from the text you can't put that it could be could made an injunction for all citizen even Muslim or non Muslim or so on even way put it and it's punishable and things like that yeah someone is born in the domain yeah to of the citizenship okay so that's something different um this case another may put condition but I don't think putting such condition makes anything in the first place okay because most people are reasonable they will they will make it in in into intellectual discussion only those who want to cause war or mischief or something they will they will use abusive and insulting language okay you make a for just few criminal cases no no that's fine I I want to know from the thingy because he gave comparative on human rights and does this violate and all these things yeah which is which is fine I want to know from um from the text the other question um from this came my thought came it comes been wanting to ask this for a long time um you know the issue ofur and Islam the as a citizens so if someone in the Muslim land and I wanted to get a comparison because if someone wants to reject the Western citizenship they can say look I don't want your protection nothing obviously he's going to get kicked out if he's from in the UK or any of the Western lands you don't want it nowhere is you're basically violated our covenant therefore because you know the issue of um there was a people who say that look it's kuur and so therefore everything Hal the taxation all of that scamming milking from the system Etc but if someone's come here so is this is my understanding correct if someone's come here like I came to this country for example not I I was born in this country my father's um came back in the 60s born in this country um my father British Sean or something yeah if I came to this country like um then as a student or became a citizen here yeah because of sponsorship whatever so there's a contract there so is that an equivalent from the Shar that look we have a covenant and we have to stick by this Covenant yeah a covenant the Covenant is Covenant of protection or or that's correct they don't kill them they don't kill you don't take their money etc etc yeah you keep at peace with them mean that you can join their army and fight Muslim etc etc yeah okay now if this the other way um so you know the people who say that look if you have no Covenant with them there's uh that harbon Etc um give me aete example what's me the other way what's the other way the my heard is this yeah the DAR har so the taxation all of this no no you are even if it's Dar har you have a covenant that is valid for you don't worry about the har of the others you are excluded from the issues of har and and peace because the only way that will make sense if someone came through um by stealth or whatever they came to C something they came to do Chief is fine yeah that's fine if he came without Covenant and sneaked in and then and I said that already in 2005 if an Iraqi at the time they were occupying Iraq come sneaks in the country and assassinate Tony Blair he's a liberty to do that and they wanted to go to the crime persecution service the said he's saying Iraq is sneaking in without any Covenant and he's he's fighting occupation Force just shut up go no case yeah what is the question now I don't know was that question so if anyone came like that and they had a child because how the so is it basically the point is is it transferred so my father came here is a British Sean but if you are if you born here you get the citizenship the citizenship is a covenant between you you have then obviously you are not responsible for ACT until you get out of age after that you have the choice if you keep the citizenship then you are bound by the Covenant or you leave so I don't know what the question yeah that's it because they never made sense to me because how can the have a covenant Muslim in a of focus on that why you looking at it's not the same here you are having a covenant was born here you have it until you come out after that you decide I don't want this domain I want to be Warrior then you have to relinquish the Covenant because they assume you have a covenant with them so go out and throw the bport in their face and start War welcome no problem yeah because there the whole issue of tax evasion and tax scam and all these things so that's another issue is other tax legitim so that's something else that you can do even an Islamic domain but this is we don't want to go in this this messy details let's get the general structure you think this you don't want to stay with a covenant you have to to declare that the system assume you are a citizen and they are in Covenant you have to tell the system no I breaking I'm going out but you have to do to do it announce it to them the best way is to go out and burn the passport or throw the passport in their face so is from their side if they were to do you know set you up the Secret Service U you know things what's Secret Service explain more clearly so you know the um the framing so they do false flag Etc if someone wants to put you in prison if it it's done to you and and you know it and you have evidence for that then they have broke the Covenant they have done then you are at War here then you can hide somewhere and do whatever you want but if they do it really and you are convinced you have evidence for that or do it through legal action yeah because you know the whole issue of if it's War then it's certain nature you do certain action because if someone's just claiming benefits um yeah all of these secondary issues focus on the point if they break the Covenant you are at Liberty they have broken it you don't need to declare they did it if you want they didn't any break of the Covenant you want to break the Covenant you go out that's correct yes it's very clear beating around the bush does not help because the Covenant here the the issue which exclude you from the relation to the rest of the um except that you cannot wage war against the um even they cannot come to you for example say listen you are your father is from Pakistan so a British citizen you are born British so you are from us now wanted to spy on Muslims or go to from ctis say sorry guys it's out that's not my understanding of citizenship if you want to force me I am to war with you get lost they will not come the moment you tell them that they will disappear right away trust me with that so that's it or they violate your rights break the Covenant or they take the C away they can do the system allows some other system do not allow Tak you have to give it you understand so the only thing I want to come back on unless I miss heard you you're saying that because as a citizen if they you know the inscription and Etc if there's a you have to refuse like mammed Al refused yeah simp because you I cannot join your war machine because I am Muslim I'm B by Islam to to fight against Muslims and fight against others unless it is in self-defense you send me to Vietnam is not self-defense you're defending your capitalist system over the devil I don't care about what you're defending but if an enemy invad the country then I will start in defending as a self-defense simple the ruling is very simple we can I think that's discussed even our book of in deta something which is not translated but yeah that's Reas if you if you took the things properly the answer is very clear so the the going back to earlier on about an hour ago that's what some Algerian especially were doing here say stealing and so and cars and claiming this is the domain of har we can't do that maybe they sneak then maybe they are doing that but some of them did not sneak and they say can do whatever yeah but you are not you are excluded from they may be they fighting in Iraq yes they are for all Muslims in the world except the who have a covenant excluding them you are now here you are excluded go out and sneak or declare or do an action which takes you out to Covenant if you are there to do it would it mean the definition of sneaking in if they falsified all the information and came into this country whatever it is sneaking in yeah that's all these possibilities are there okay so I want to go back to your point you know you're saying I just want to get clarification as the people of um who are holding the rulers um in place whether it's military or tribes Etc um these people obviously have the power they're the ones who supporting the rulers apart from them is it a individ obligation for in the Muslim lands where there's the Muslims majority they have the Muslim Army is it obligation on the individuals as well is that what what you're saying um for them to fight obligation of the it's if sufficient people do it then but everyone is have part of the obligation because it's canot be obligation on a single individual but what do you see the ruler and the Army protecting him and the the royal guard or whatever presidential guard what what what what you meant can we fight no no my point is that from the reality the people who are the military who are actually supporting um the and who have the power to go for example in Egypt they have a border with um Palestine so they could easily um that's that's theoretically but they are supporting the ruler they are part of the ruling system they are the enemy no no that's what I'm saying so these so these people so in the they have the power and as Muslims individuals who are there citizens is K fire on them um to actually uh as a as to fight brother you discussing if they are supporting the ruler and they know that the ruler is betraying Islam and Muslim mus Muslim must sorry if that's inor I'm saying the why are mentioning those around the ruler are mentioning the mass I don't understand what the relation I don't know what which reality you are describing that we can make a ruling about it so the rule the people in the military they have they're the ones who are trained who have the equipment Etc they're the on who are supporting the regime yeah okay so they're the ones who naturally have that um Power and Equipment they are with the regime what do you expect them to do unless you have someone sneaking in there and make a that's something else yeah I don't understand the question the question is Muslims for example in Egypt the um who

walk walk up in this case I would advise everyone who walks up there keep a low profile even if you meet their meeting and they drink drink with them with the intention to destroy them what's a question that's question what tactics how to do a revolution this has to be decided in every place by its condition but that regime has to be removed because the um the majority are are having intrinsically the power they have to activ if you can activate it as a as a as a commander in the army of a unit for example you are in the in the in the presidential God and you woke up and then

## When they use the word "M", is it usually related to something that was obligatory for the Prophet (PBUH)? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 0.32s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the word "M" is often used in discussions about the Prophet's (PBUH) actions, and it is important to understand that not everything he did was obligatory for his followers.  Just because he performed an action does not automatically make it obligatory for others. 

## What is the speaker's explanation for why something the Prophet (PBUH) did not do may not be considered obligatory? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 3.959s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that if the Prophet (PBUH) did not perform an action, it could be for various reasons, including it being a permissible action but not obligatory, undesirable, or even forbidden. Therefore, simply because he didn't do something doesn't mean it's forbidden.

## What does the speaker say about the concept of "nothingness" being evidence for anything? 
**Category:** Logic
**Timestamp:** 22.519s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that the absence of something cannot be used as evidence for anything.  "Nothingness" has no inherent meaning or implication, so it cannot be used to prove or disprove a claim. 

## When the Prophet (PBUH) performs an action and then leaves it, what can you conclude about the action?
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 33.04s
**Answer:** When the Prophet (PBUH) deliberately left an action after doing it, it indicates that the action is not obligatory. He may have left it because it was optional, undesirable, or forbidden.

## What does the speaker mean when they say that the Prophet (PBUH) "deliberately left" an action? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 53.079s

## How does the speaker explain the concept of "Bid'ah"? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 505.36s 
**Answer:** The speaker describes how "Bid'ah" (innovation in religion) is often wrongly framed and made into a significant issue that overshadows more important aspects of faith. This extreme focus on "Bid'ah" can lead to harmful religious practices.

## What does the speaker say is the issue with people concluding things based on face value without considering fundamental principles? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 345.6s 
**Answer:** The speaker argues that people often make assumptions based on surface interpretations of Hadiths (Prophet's sayings) without considering the underlying principles of Islamic law. This can lead to incorrect interpretations and conclusions.

## What is the basic ruling of permissibility in Islam? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 372.24s
**Answer:**  The speaker explains that the basic ruling of permissibility in Islam is that everything is permissible unless proven otherwise. This means that actions, thoughts, and behaviors are assumed to be allowed unless explicitly forbidden by Islamic teachings.

## How does the speaker address the argument that incorporating an act into one's worship makes it recommended?
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 386.319s 
**Answer:** The speaker states that even if someone incorporates a certain act into their worship and considers it recommended, it doesn't automatically make it a valid religious practice unless there is evidence to support it.

## What is the speaker's main argument against the claim that celebrating the Prophet's (PBUH) birthday is obligatory? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 408.36s 
**Answer:** The speaker argues that celebrating the Prophet's (PBUH) birthday is not an Arabic tradition and there is no evidence to suggest it is obligatory. While the Prophet (PBUH) did praise Monday as a blessed day, this doesn't mean celebrating his birthday is obligatory.

## What does the speaker say about the practice of stoning the Devil with stones of a certain size?
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 639.2s
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the Prophet (PBUH) emphasized using small stones for stoning the Devil and cautioned against going to extremes in devotion. This is because previous nations were destroyed due to their extremism, and exaggerating the practice could lead to violence and destruction.

## How does the speaker respond to the argument that incorporating rituals into worship is the root of extremism? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 689.48s
**Answer:** The speaker argues that this argument is faulty because the Prophet (PBUH) specifically instructed to use small stones and avoid extremism in religious practices. He also provided examples of previous nations destroyed due to their extremism. 

## What is the speaker's explanation for the Prophet's (PBUH) statement about previous nations being destroyed? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 721.48s 
**Answer:**  The speaker points out that the Prophet (PBUH) mentioned previous nations being destroyed in relation to two specific examples: the one about the size of stones for stoning the Devil and another about punishing the poor differently from the rich. This shows that the statement wasn't meant to apply to all forms of religious extremism.

## Why does the speaker suggest that it is important to go back to the Quran for clarification on fundamental issues? 
**Category:** Islamic Law
**Timestamp:** 942.48s
**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of referring to the Quran for guidance on fundamental issues.

The Quran, being divinely protected, provides a more reliable and complete source of understanding.

## How can the Quran insist Maria is the daughter of Imran, while all available texts before Islam don't mention that?
Category: Quran
1.0s: That the Quran insists stubbornly that Maria the daughter of Imran. And but all available texts in the hand of Christian before obviously for for the inception of Islam and after that and all of them are actually before Islam anyway even the one who was allegedly allegedly supposed to be an an Arabic translation, an early transition to Arabic with my Syriac document we'll come to that yesterday the headlights are there and how much reliable is that. That all of them that don't mention mariam in tamil I told him the daughter of someone called him so the ramrod is not mentioned then the usual stun an explanation which I think, nobody is doing it now because it is just it's a if someone claimed that will make himself disgraceful that it's actually muhammad is so stupid let me use these words liberally and they will use try to be neutral not saying messenger or revelation or no revelation just mention the various point of view as neutral as possible that is associated with that he confused maryam the sister of of haroon and the sister of musa which is obviously as you know 1500 years roughly that's the best estimate some people say it's only 1200 years but over millennium before the time of Christ with with maryam the model of Christ. 

## If Muhammad was so ignorant, why does the Quran expand the story of Musa, but never mentions his sister? 
Category: Quran
2.0s: This is this could be only assumed really nobody will will will make such a blunder except someone who is utmost stupidity and ignorance about the scripture but just a casual scanning through the Quran the story of musa is expanded very in very details with never anywhere his sister or the small family conflict which has been recorded in in the in the constitution the so-called torah. 

## Why does the Quran place so much importance on Maryam, even going so far as to say that she was favored by God?
Category: Quran
3.0s: The Quran insists on maryam bin tamra is number one. Just keep this point in mind. 

##  What is the Quranic narrative of Maryam's life? 
Category: Quran 
4.0s: Secondly now we go to the story of maryam Quran it is expanded actually in two places first one is the nativity and they showed the career that's in surat al-imran and the other one in surat maryam let us start with according to the order of the Quran although the the because this is one coronerically chronologically it should be earlier than the one in in in surat maryam but obviously in the order of the Quran and even also in the other revelations thought mariam is amaki with certitude that's there's no doubt about that. 

##  Why was Maryam's story revealed to the prophet in Mecca?
Category: Quran
5.0s: So many narration even it has been recited to the negos jashi the king of Abyssinian there were discussion about Jesus and his nature and so on. There are various famous narrations in Islamic history so it is a maki while al imran is a dis portion specifically is related to a debate under and and the challenge to a mutual conversation with the christian delegation coming from azeroth that is in the tenth year the last year of the prophet century so revelation wise even the maryam part is earlier but in the order of the Quran this is India in the order so let's go the other Quran because this is also the part of the story is before getting pregnant and giving birth. 

## What is the story of Zakaria and his wife?
Category: Quran
6.0s: Imraan's wife said mentioned this event was elect behold lord I have vowed to you what is what what is in my womb to be holy is dedicated to you accepted from me you you hear and know all things.

## How does the Quran portray Zakaria's life?
Category: Quran
7.0s: And when the career visits here in the in in the inner sanctuary in the maharab in the altar near secretary he found she had she had sustenance food sisters. He said mary mariam how did you get this she said it is from god god provides bounty for whom he wills. 

##  How does Zakaria’s life fit into the larger narrative of the Quran?
Category: Quran
8.0s: He said lord be gracious to me and give me such blessed blessed child you certainly hear prayers. So let me see the arab because he asked for a child specifically I will ask for someone who will take over the priesthood after him yeah yeah he said he offspring so he asked for the ali for offspring so he wanted himself strings most likely in his mind maybe from relative from cousins from himself not necessarily for himself god also the sons of your brothers are regarded your offspring in the general sense especially in a in in the semitic foundation arabic islam and jewish tradition it is it is the the children of your your cousins etc are regarded like your children. 

## What is the significance of the "Word of God"?
Category: Quran 
9.0s:  God gives you the good news of John of johannes confirm a word from god that's that's a significant word who will be confirming a word from god and this word from god is supposed to be isolated but so giving the title word from god is obviously ancient if the if that's a revelation the Quran says that reality was called the word from god is correct and seem to we have historic root but that's provided we claim the quran is for a divine revelation this is the truth but keep that at the side then as a question mark.

## What is the story of Maryam's pregnancy and giving birth?
Category: Quran 
10.0s: She said she was a state of shock lord how can I have a boy actually is wrong because it is what she said how can I have an offspring wallet is not boy.

Now let me that this virgin birth is a very sore point for the modern and analysts of this people discussing the the old testament and refuting many aspects then you would stem it refuting many aspects of it with good reasons like our video I gave it to lux hopefully in fdu they discussed about the story of the birth and obviously the attack also the virgin path and they mentioned Islam also approved believes the very verse and they think the best has been disproved what has been disproved is the story about bethlehem and so on and the evidence they brought is devastating no doubt about that.

## How does the Quran describe the events leading up to Maryam's pregnancy?
Category: Quran 
12.0s: Mention in the book the story of maryam when she would draw from her family to a place toward the east so this is not in the temple yeah she would draw from her family and said in taberna that and tablet she extracted herself. So it looks like she it was like a little struggle because this was for example the untouchable India called mahmoud the untouchable the rejected one so she instructed herself she rejected herself so they maybe have some discussion and things like that and she pulled herself out from them maybe they were not very happy about this.

**Question:** so this is the question the brothers kindly put into writing there is a Hadith about Aisha who is referring to qur'ash fasting uh the ashora before Islam and after Ramadan became obligatory the prophet that whoever wants to fast fast whoever whoever who doesn't want to don't there is a famous Hadith about the prophet wanting to fast on the ninth day but not being able to because of his death okay that producer from IBN Abbas so um so I if if we'll get all these asses whether it's not then kind of let me give you the summary what he wants really but he did not know how to summarize the the majority of people go to the Hadith positions in bukhari I don't know anybody else the witch claims when he arrived in Medina he so followed the Jews fasting a day say what is this day you are fasting that's Hadith claims that they said this is a day Allah saved Musa from forever okay you're following me he's jumping up yeah I'm sure he'll be able to see him later on well and Musa fasted it and we fasten it like that to be fasted the problem with this Hadith the main Authority most people use it is that historically first of all it is strange that the messenger Allah asks us to ask the Jews about today they are fasting that's number one he never asked him I will take off their D that's number one that's what that's the only situation with us secondly they say when he arrived in Medina seems to from the context it was the day he arrived the day he arrived the day he arrived was not not was Yom Kippur that's the day they are fasting we know that the day of atonement but that's not the day Allah that's the day the 70 men who were killed were killed by by by by a thunderbolt in Mount Sinai because you asked to see Allah and uh were killed by Allah Oscar was trying to revive them and they revived them and as a tank maybe Musa how fast did that so there's some thought in the story there's some question mark about the whole situation so we have to study let's not see if there's anything but it seems to be it's related to the first thing of the use of young people or the they they told him it is that he's fasting because Allah revived these and the Muslim thanks Allah but some narrator confused that with saving for Veron and added that from his imagination it seems to be the sahaba oil fasting they were and those killed in calculating the the tense of uh of uh was killed in calculating it according to the calendar of the Jews and their plastic according to calendar of the Jews not to to the level calendar it seems to be because there have been a relation that they were going to say the fabric to calculate them that a problem they according to the luniz solar calendar of the Jews and it happened by miraculous coincidence is that the day the day Hussain was melted it was the tenth of the sharing and the tenth of maharla and after that it became the tense of Muhammad and everyone starts with Iran nobody was shaking with the Jews after that so that means all of this need to be clarified strengthen the fact that it is that are abused to fast search for some reason and the rosary was fasting it as Total War or or that as a as a fasting and then uh Ramadan came and this was abrogated so the whole matter is a bit upside down it needs more thorough
**Answer:** The speaker is asking about the historical context of the fast of Ashura and whether it is actually related to the Jewish fast of Yom Kippur. They are also questioning the reliability of the Hadith that mentions the Prophet asking the Jews about their fast. 

## 7681.08s: Category:  Interpretation 
**Question:** anyone else the brothers got a follow-on question apologies I think he wants some clarity on on this so in the same example around somebody immigrating and if they have the choice from between a more religious relation and a less belligerent one so what if we make more money in the US I have job opportunity it doesn't matter it doesn't matter I already say it doesn't matter you have the right here and there there's nothing to do with religion if you go there you do a Covenant security access that's it as long as you can protect your Dean you can you're not that fight against Muslims it's it's not desirable it's not a desirable State of Affair definitely then you rank things according to your to your understanding you say that you make more money that's balance things maybe make your money is better for you and Twitter for the um than going to Sweden where you are begging and getting maybe uh benefit well in America you can make money which helps the ummah and helps the poor I think the misconception may be that I think okay I think I think he's coming from himself back around that being in the domain of kofar for no reason like study or like like medical treatment you should have this one where you fight the kofar because they pay taxes the dealers are superficial they're really superficial no no because you can remember they said okay we're gonna fight America because there's a bit we've talked into the videos because they pay taxes and they're implicit that was you know do you remember back in the days whereas the the more consistent point is about retribution if they can make transgression against you return the transgression is a more consistent argument than say just because by virtue of the person paying taxes yeah I think that's where it might be yeah yeah no no no this is this is I think this is coming from State no he's not setup but I think it's probably maybe maybe these ideas or maybe he's just sitting with people of this persuasion I just want to say that we're living with a being with the kofar relying on the bridge and the default generation that uh I have nothing to do with anyone living with them so that their War their Lata and they misunderstood you cannot live with them but it's not correct that's that's a part of the Hadith to fight certain people and then they were Believers and then without this reliever not distinct so that Khaled to kill them and to to announce that they are most
**Answer:** The speaker is asking for clarification about the permissibility of living in countries hostile to Islam, particularly in the context of seeking economic opportunity. They are questioning the argument that living in such countries is inherently wrong due to the taxes paid to the government. 

## 7884.96s: Category:  Interpretation
**Question:** so the brother's concerned about paying taxes and all this kind of stuff look there's an area of permissibility between McGraw to recommend it or whatever it may be then you're not going to find it being taxes you don't you don't go to a country to pay attention the state The Authority force on you to pay taxes even now in Saudi Arabia pay taxes now if you believe that tax is not legitimate or the authorities limit then you are at Liberty not to pay but you are then and there is danger to in 20 years in prison take take your risk if you want I will not advise anyone to do that because you should not put yourself so that you go into prison for 20 years because you fail to pay taxes especially in capitalist country taxes are more important I was once joking with someone say if someone go to Buckingham Palace and sneak like this man who they found them as the next the bed of the queen uh that's like 15 years ago or 20 years ago if even if you go and rape the queen say I was in love and so on you get three years in prison but if you don't pay your taxes you get 20 years at this these people these entities here survival and tax money so they are forced anywhere else in Sweden also will pay taxes one second one second this will be the last statement because we're gonna I can't uh I have to entertain other people as well but look cordawi went as far as saying fighting in the military as Halal in a famous fatwa honestly I don't give a damn well I don't think anyone cares what the dog he says these government Scholars well you know we have the evidences and sorting this out we discussed in the research about about immigration citizenship and the right of self-determination the appendix about uh is appended to that research is clearly showing that those who are fighting with the kofar uh they are classified as of the Ayah but if they are with the kofar but they are aside and they don't fight and they hold the hand back then they have we have no right to fight them or kill them that's explained and this is just hand him if he knows Arabic he can take the Arabic version and the English one is I think it's still under polishing that's it yeah I mean look if we go into that I mean we have always definitely uh there's so many examples you know like it's burning to my mind I wanted to pistol with people so for example you had MCB and standing handing just you know like a dirty little gungan little rodent standing next to Tony Blair Yusuf bile up all these these Stooges these Bootleggers right next to Tony Blair on during the war on terror we can't use these people as would you it's Allah there's a messenger and these the rest of these guys can take a hike they're they're never going to be an authority at the end of the day this is the mentality of ours whereby oh so-and-so said it oh the holy people they just did they float they don't walk they float we must accept them let's make saju to them you know this kind of mentality just takes some bleach and bleach that out of your brain go for the evidence ask this any one of these Mr evidence what a historical evidence these guys they want to make a lot of they used to make a good point they want to have ijaza to make their own dinner they you know they always unless you're a jar but oh great you've got a job that can that can rubber stamp anything I want that's what they want so forget them just what's the evidence bring it on anyone who wants to discuss let them come bring their Scholars whatever it is you know I mean write it down come face to face really you know we're done with this kind of mentality of a p you know so and so said so so-and-so Chinese Whispers anyway Iqbal over to you bro
**Answer:** The speaker is addressing concerns about paying taxes to a hostile government, emphasizing that such a situation does not necessarily make living in that country impermissible. They also touch upon the issue of fighting in the military of such a country, arguing that it is not permissible, but also noting that it is not a simple issue.  

## 8108.06s: Category:  Interpretation
**Question:** I had a quick question related to an Ayah uh but before that I want to mention another incident as well which was related to it so in uh when results 1400 sahaba that command was specific to those 1400 it was not to all the Muslims so the Muslims and who were left in Mecca in Medina in Bahrain in abyssinia that command was not applicable to them so those 1400 sahaba when they refused to take off their Haram or when they hesitated essentially that was a kind of unanimous age matter they took to not uh apply that action however Salam rejected the original and he said this isn't valid because it went against this command now this action in Hunan that happened as well when he went back to his companion and he said that your brothers that they have regretted their they made a mistake now they want their women back now all of the sahaba on apparent it showed that they agreed to return back the women folk however again results for assalam seemed that he rejected that sort of uh I would send the Hadith later as I'm now driving somewhere he rejected that sort of apparent of the sahaba and he said let your leaders come to me to say which one of you actually agree whether you all agree or whether you don't so he still did not so what would you consider that to also be another example against the ejima that you know we cannot take it unless we are certain uh from that and the final bit that I wanted to mention is in regards to uh the tattoo um while I I actually don't agree with it but nonetheless every Hadith that contains rasula Islam's statement his actual or a statement because majority of the Hadith this matter or narrator true meaning people's understanding of how they understood the command they've narrated it so the Hadith that actually contains or apparently contains the statement of rasulullah all the pronouns are for ladies so it either says ha or it says so for that reason the question is would you agree that if we apply that to the men uh assuming those are Hadith that say we will have to do here which is again another bottle uh uh um
**Answer:** The speaker is asking about the issue of ijma (consensus) among the sahaba, citing examples where certain sahaba disagreed with the apparent consensus. They are specifically looking for the professor's view on whether these examples are indicative of a broader principle that we should not rely on ijma unless there is absolute certainty.

**Answer:** The speaker is pointing out that the verses discussed earlier, which primarily address the conflict between the Muslims and the disbelievers of Mecca, will be interpreted by some as applying to Muslim leaders who have become tyrannical. The speaker is reminding the professor of this point and asking for clarification.

**Question:** he mentioned some crucial things which uh we would say are groundbreaking right some extent about how this needs to be understood because we have from one extreme you have the um the the sound of jihadists and stuff like that laying this as the general basis that this is the um this is the general state that basically Allah broke the Covenant and you just go around killing everyone and that's Islam right now the other side is okay fine would they'll be quiet about those eyes right but then they'll say okay this Ayah is just applies to the profile not too deep more and all that kind of stuff the people that are placed in in power of us because you know even if the Western people put them in they're still overpowered you and all this ridiculous stuff right so we need to find the basis and what we'll find the what's up here is clear that what Jacob is saying is that Islam is not a religion which preaches uh uh mindless aggression it is one that preaches yeah it preaches and it has the principle of Justice right and establishing of God's law but if the people fight Us in that and don't let us live in peace then we have a right to defend ourselves that's the basic point the second point to know is for them is this right as for those people who are attempting to cement the um the position of the following which their own books now the thing is this is the final point we'll leave and this is a claim for those who will stay if you say your followers of Muhammad bin Abdullah how is this the case right that he himself votes from Ibraham saying that um and then you have this thing but then you will call your leaders interesting isn't it very interesting the point is there is a situation here where a lie has been placed that we are the guardians of the Salas and this thing is pushed by a Mindless repetition and shutdown alhamdulillah now we have uh brothers and other people who are exposing the lie and they have no response so what is their thing just to curse but what does this indicate always when you just spit out don't listen to him it means you have no argument it's the same with our brother this and this is a different level we're not accusing them of being problematic in their basis what we're accusing them on the other thing is we've had this thing like for example if it has his opinion on music or these kind of stuff right they will say okay we will dismiss it you won't only dismiss it but why is an argument dismissed it's only dismissed because you know you don't have a response to the argument from the analysis of the narration so what we say to everyone out there and inshallah can end on this is look we must have mean versus our principle we take it Allah we take this and we apply our understanding as best as we can to that if we are wrong come to us and show this show us what the previous caller said and criticize it and or join it or benefit from it yeah exactly we're not rejecting anything we're not starting from zero we know there's plenty of work has been done in the past and take as much of its own world as possible or flesh it out or expand it yeah yeah the thing is what what does what the statement is from everyone all we are asking is for our writers brothers and Muslims to say look come discuss with us yeah these doors are always open and then we look forward to many for future disastructures
**Answer:** The speaker is highlighting the need for a balanced understanding of the verses related to fighting, as they are often misrepresented by both extremists and those who wish to minimize their importance. They emphasize that Islam is a religion of peace and justice but that it also contains principles of self-defense when necessary.

##  Iran's Attacks on Israel 

**What is the current situation between Iran and Israel?** 
*Timestamp:* 11.759s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:*  The speaker outlines the recent attacks by Iran on Israeli targets. They emphasize the damage done by drones, missiles, and ballistic missiles and the disruption of Israeli defense systems. 

**How did Iran communicate its retaliation for the Israeli embassy attack?**
*Timestamp:* 30.56s
*Category:* Diplomacy
*Answer:* The head of the CIA, who was in Oman at the time, was contacted by Iran and informed that they would take retribution for the embassy attack. This backdoor diplomacy was necessary because open diplomacy had failed,  and the CIA head was chosen due to his diplomatic experience and ability to negotiate. Iran assured the CIA that they would not target American lives, but they would carry out a significant attack.

**What was the extent of the damage from Iranian drone attacks?**
*Timestamp:* 210.599s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  Despite initial claims of a 99.9% success rate in intercepting the drones, it has been revealed that the actual number is closer to 86%. Some drones were successful in penetrating Israeli defenses, exhausting their Iron Dome system and diverting attention.

**Why was it significant that Iranian cruise missiles were successful?** 
*Timestamp:* 262.12s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:* Cruise missiles were able to gather intelligence about Israeli defense facilities, exposing their location and mapping their defenses, including the types of radar systems they used. This intelligence could be crucial for future attacks.

**What is the significance of Israeli high-ranking personnel being injured in the attacks?**
*Timestamp:* 440.8s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  The Iranian attacks caused considerable damage to Israeli facilities, including the loss of high-ranking personnel.  These individuals, including engineers and skilled staff, are difficult to replace, resulting in a significant loss for the Israeli military.

**What is the significance of the alleged panic within the Israeli war cabinet?**
*Timestamp:* 480.28s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:*  Rumors suggest that the Israeli war cabinet was in a state of panic following the attacks. They are allegedly concerned that the public's faith in their ability to defend the country is shaken. This could lead to a mass exodus from Israel, as many might fear for their safety. 

**How much money did Israel spend on defense during the attacks?**
*Timestamp:* 541.6s
*Category:* Economy
*Answer:*  An estimated $1.5 billion to $3 billion was spent on Israeli defense during the 24 hours of Iranian attacks. This includes the cost of expensive missiles and planes, highlighting the financial strain on Israel.

**What is the impact of the American refusal to help refuel Israeli planes?**
*Timestamp:* 895.04s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:* The American refusal to refuel Israeli planes during the attacks limits their ability to reach Iranian targets. This significantly restricts the scope of any potential Israeli retaliation. 

**What was the purpose of the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities?**
*Timestamp:* 990.04s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:*   The Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which was initially portrayed as a significant blow, turned out to be a small-scale drone attack that caused minimal damage. This might have been a psychological warfare tactic, intended to project strength and deter Iran from future attacks.

**What is the significance of the Israeli withdrawal of troops from the Lebanese border?**
*Timestamp:* 1139.48s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  The Israeli withdrawal of troops from the Lebanese border, likely influenced by American pressure, indicates their reluctance to engage in a larger conflict with Lebanon. This may be due to the risk of a significant counterattack from Hezbollah, which has a vast arsenal of missiles, including supersonic and hypersonic ones.

**Why is it improbable that Israel will attack Iran?**
*Timestamp:* 1271.44s
*Category:* Military
*Answer:*  Israel is unlikely to attack Iran because they lack the necessary military capabilities to effectively target Iranian facilities. Their missile technology is inferior to Iran's, and they are not equipped to handle a potential counterattack that would be significantly stronger than the recent drone and missile attacks.

**How are Iranian leaders viewed?**
*Timestamp:* 1654.0s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The speaker criticizes Iranian leadership, accusing them of lacking faith in their own strength and relying too heavily on technology rather than the will to fight. They suggest that a change in Iranian leadership could be necessary to shift their approach.

**Why is the American involvement in the conflict a bluff?**
*Timestamp:* 1974.559s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The speaker argues that the American involvement in the conflict is a bluff. They cite previous examples where the US has backed down from military threats, including the Vietnam War and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

**What is the impact of the Palestinian Authority's request for statehood?**
*Timestamp:* 1985.519s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The Palestinian Authority's request for statehood at the UN was vetoed by the US. The speaker criticizes this action, calling it hypocritical considering the US claims to support the two-state solution. This has damaged the Palestinian Authority's legitimacy and weakened their position in negotiations. 

**How did the recent conflict expose the weaknesses of the Palestinian Authority?**
*Timestamp:* 2024.519s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The US veto of the Palestinian Authority's statehood request has exposed their weakness and dependence on US support.  Despite their claims of independence, they are still subject to American influence and unable to control the situation in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas.

**What is the likely outcome of the conflict?**
*Timestamp:* 2095.96s
*Category:* Politics
*Answer:* The speaker believes that the conflict could escalate or de-escalate.  Within Iran, there are growing calls for a more aggressive response, including the possibility of using nuclear weapons.

>  The speaker explains that the phrase “those deeply rooted in knowledge” is in the accusative case, indicating that it is a direct object of a hidden verb. This means that the verse is actually saying "I specifically mention those who are deeply rooted in knowledge", highlighting their dedication to faith and knowledge. 

**4:41**  |  **Prophets and Revelation** | The speaker inquires about the verse that mentions prophets like Noah, Abraham, and Moses, and asks why they are being highlighted in this particular context.
> The speaker clarifies that the verse's focus on these specific prophets is due to the intended audience - the "People of the Book." They represent a key lineage in prophethood, especially within the last 4000 years. The speaker also acknowledges the possibility of other prophetic lines in different parts of the world, mentioning potential examples in China, India, and Native American cultures. 

**10:23**  |  **Direct Revelation to Moses** | The speaker asks about the specific mention of God speaking directly to Moses, wondering if this was unique to him or if other prophets also experienced direct communication with God. 
>  The speaker explains that while direct communication with God is a rare occurrence for prophets, it seems to have been a defining characteristic of Moses's mission. He suggests that while other prophets may have received direct communication on certain occasions, Moses had a unique relationship with God. 

**12:39**  | **Prophets in the Quran** | The speaker poses a question about prophets not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, wondering how we can be sure they existed.
> The speaker explains that the Quran focuses on the main prophetic line of the central civilizations of the world, such as the holy land, Arabia, and surrounding areas. It doesn't mean there weren't other prophets in different regions like Africa, India, China, and Native America. However, their histories might be shrouded in mystery or embellished with legends, making it difficult to confirm their existence definitively.  

**19:51**  |  **Old Testament Accuracy** | The speaker raises concerns about the historical accuracy of the Old Testament, particularly the first five books, and asks for a historical overview.
> The speaker discusses the complexities of the Old Testament's transmission and canonization. He notes that the version we have today is a result of scholarly efforts in the third century BC.  He also mentions the availability of a more recent text (Masoretic Text) from the 10th century AD, which is considered more authentic and reliable. However, even the Old Testament's textual history shows evidence of editing and re-editing, with some books possibly abridged or lost entirely. He acknowledges the importance of approaching the Old Testament with a critical eye, recognizing that even the historical sections may contain inaccuracies or biases.

**26:11**  | **Purpose of Messengers** | The speaker asks about the ultimate reason why God sends messengers to humanity. 
> The speaker argues that messengers are sent to provide proof of the resurrection and the day of judgment. He emphasizes that messengers are not sent to teach mundane matters like inheritance laws, but rather to offer guidance and a message of hope for a better afterlife. He also discusses the possibility that those who never receive a messenger might have an easier path to paradise due to their lack of knowledge about potential temptations and challenges.

**28:42**  | **Allah as Witness** | The speaker raises a question about the verse that states "God himself bears witness to what he has sent down to you." He suggests that this seems strange because God witnessing for Muhammad seems redundant.
> The speaker clarifies that this verse is not addressed to those who have already received proof. Instead, it’s a philosophical statement aimed at those who believe that prophets receive knowledge without direct communication from God, but rather through a passive reception of divine energy.  This verse emphasizes the active and conscious nature of God's revelation, challenging those who believe in a detached, impersonal divine entity.

**32:68** | **Destiny of Those Who Reject the Truth** | The speaker asks about the fate of those who deny the truth and actively prevent others from following the right path.
> The speaker explains that those who reject the truth and mislead others will be condemned. They will not even receive the benefit of divine guidance in the form of dreams or other subtle interventions, as they have chosen to ignore the clear evidence presented to them. This is a consequence of their stubbornness and their deliberate rejection of God's message. 

**37:54**  | **God's Ownership of All Things** | The speaker emphasizes the verse that says "to God belongs everything that is in the heavens and on earth" and highlights its significance.
> The speaker emphasizes that God's dominion over all things is absolute, and this should be understood as a reassurance for believers.

> The speaker clarifies that this verse is aimed at both Jews and Christians who have gone to extremes in their beliefs. The Jews, he explains, went too far by rejecting Jesus as a messenger, while Christians, he believes, went too far by elevating Jesus to divine status. The verse calls for a balanced and truthful understanding of faith.

**42:32**  | **The Messiah's Humility** | The speaker questions the statement that the Messiah "was never too proud to be God's servant."  He asks if this is a criticism of Christians who believe in Jesus’s divinity.
> The speaker clarifies that this verse highlights the fundamental difference between Islam and Christianity. He emphasizes that the Messiah (Jesus), according to Islam, was a servant of God and a messenger, not a divine being. He states that this was also the understanding of the early Church Fathers, especially in the first century. However, this view later became overshadowed by the development of trinitarian theology, where Jesus’s divinity became a central tenet of the faith. 

**46:26**  | **Early Church History** | The speaker asks about the role of the Jerusalem Church and early Church Fathers in the development of Christian beliefs.
> The speaker discusses the early Church, highlighting the differences in theology between the Jerusalem Church, which believed Jesus was a prophet, and the Pauline school, which emphasized Jesus’s divinity. The speaker suggests that the Jerusalem Church was eventually marginalized and its history overshadowed by the rise of Pauline Christianity, which eventually gained dominance through its emphasis on Jesus’s divinity. He emphasizes the need to revisit original sources to understand the diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints within early Christianity.  

**50:14**  | **The Importance of Understanding Inheritance Laws** | The speaker mentions the issue of inheritance and suggests that it is important to understand how it is addressed in Islamic teachings.
> The speaker hints at a future discussion on the subject of inheritance, highlighting the importance of understanding the proper Islamic interpretation of these laws. He also mentions a specific case involving Ibn Abbas and Umar, two prominent figures in Islamic history.  The speaker implies that this case will serve as a basis for further discussion about proper understanding of inheritance in Islam.

52.64s: Um, and then it because of Injustice 
56.879s: And transgression of the people who Jiz
59.359s: The Jews
60.44s: We have prohibited things and so on
62.16s: That's essentially a second context but
64.519s: It's continuation of the previous one so
66.52s: The previous context
69.439s: Is rebuking the Jews for their
72.36s: Transgression time
75.88s: Past, in response to that that they
79.479s: Demanding that you bring them a book 
81.68s: From Heaven Etc and so on maybe like
84.32s: What Musa brought the tablets and things
86.6s: That we discussed that and uh, and Allah
89.68s: Said
90.52s: This is nothing new they have asked more 
92.68s: Than they ask to see Allah directly etc 
95.28s: Etc until it goes
100.159s: To their their the break breaking of the
103.72s: Sabbath and breaking of their covenants
106.04s: And then the the rejection of the signs
108.28s: Of Allah and killing the prophets

115.84s: Need to receive anything new Etc and
118.719s: Then it says
121.799s: For their disbelief and 
124.64s: Their Grievous utterance
127.44s: Against peace be upon here and the
130.64s: Statement that we killed the Messiah the
132.599s: Son of Maryam the messenger of Allah
134.28s: Mockingly obviously, and the Quran says
141.36s: Clearly they did not kill they did not
143.879s: Kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it
146.72s: Was made to appear like that and we
148.28s: Discussed that last time or have that
150.92s: For in English one day
156.08s: Soon those who have disputing about it
159.0s: They are confused they have no fir
161.04s: Knowledge except following conjectures
163.2s: And guess work and they indeed they did
165.959s: Not kill him for certainly then
171.44s: Now Allah lifted him to lifted Isa to
174.8s: Him and Allah is exalted and wise, or 
178.959s: Perfectionist
180.92s: Here in this place it says elevated him

186.4s: Up to
188.72s: Him and the AY which matter of 
191.4s: Discussion comes after that, but let us
193.879s: Go back to the Ayah in I have it in some
197.84s: Writing I wrote in Arabic the in
203.68s: Iman discusses this lifting in more 
206.04s: Detail, let's go to it quickly, just just
208.48s: Give it a quick scan
210.439s: So connect this to
215.72s: The have written plenty of things here
218.239s: 20 pages about these various
227.439s: Issues
236.12s: So
238.68s: Okay
241.64s: There's a chapter in writing about the 
243.319s: Coming of Isa before this, the chapter
246.599s: With the title of
248.2s: This, so
253.12s: In, we have the AY are saying there the 
268.6s: Following
271.68s: Anyway I recite it for 
275.56s: Memory, here it is in
279.28s: This the lifting of the is not mentioned
283.16s: Alone, is mentioned in a complex sequence
286.32s: Allah
298.56s: Says
300.919s: Essentially saying OHA I am receiving
305.16s: With and lifting you to me and purifying
307.919s: You from 
309.72s: Disbelievers 
312.12s: Here, number that's the IR number 55 in 
316.479s: Al, if you want to go to read the 
318.08s: Translation, that's okay, you can go back 
319.52s: To Alan number 55 or 54 because my count
323.68s: Here, this is the count we have the count
325.919s: Of H
328.479s: Actually, so 
336.52s: 55, are you there?
342.25s: [Music]
351.32s: [Music]
358.479s: Yeah
364.59s: [Music]
370.08s: Yeah, that that's enough we just need the
372.28s: Translation, just to bring that in our
375.919s: Memory, you have 
378.919s: The, sorry 
381.319s: What
382.919s: 55, 55 you give me two
387.16s: Seconds, yeah just go to the website, that
389.639s: One we said it has 55, find it, one second
393.68s: Just click in the main page, and then
395.68s: Even 55 is there, and remember when said
399.36s: So this is 
401.199s: With that's the one that's the one, and
403.8s: Remember when you said, oh Moses indeed
405.919s: We shall not, no no no no I have 55 
411.56s: In, going back, just to connecting the
414.52s: Two, three, says 355, bro, 355. My, yes, okay
420.919s: Lo God said, oh Jesus verily I shall 
423.36s: Cause thee to die, and shall exalt thee
425.599s: Unto me and cleanse thee of the presence 
427.8s: Of those who are bent on denying the 
429.639s: Truth and I shall Place those who follow 
432.319s: Thee just only this and purify so read
435.199s: Another translation we only just the
437.199s: Address to okay so God said Jesus, I will
441.199s: Cause you to die, and raise you up to me,
442.759s: And purify you from those who denied the 
444.84s: Truth, and I will exalt your followers
447.039s: Over those who deny you until the res
449.479s: Beginning on all of them, say cause you
452.199s: To die, yeah yeah, all of them is there
455.0s: Another one who says that, well one of 
457.199s: Them, this is says oh Jesus, I will raise
460.52s: I will take you and raise you up to
462.12s: Myself, yeah, I'll take you, that's correct
467.84s: Because when we say IIM, that's Ibrahim 
471.199s: Who completed all what he's been ordered
473.4s: To do and delivered in Wa the is so
478.319s: That's giving everything what you are
480.159s: Supposed to
481.28s: Give
485.44s: That's and the the the the other form of 
489.68s: It is that is someone giving and then 
493.4s: One the opposite receiving in full is
497.159s: Or so, I will receive you I will take you 
499.96s: In full total all of your body and soul
503.08s: And everything, so the translation is
505.199s: That I cause you to die is nonsensical
507.159s: It may be, it may be not, we don't know
509.08s: What deception, but the AY is clearly
511.159s: What's 
512.24s: Saying, I, I will reive you to me in full 
515.599s: By lifting you to me
517.479s: Up, and before that I have purified you
520.8s: The reason for that for all this process
522.68s: That I purified you from disbeliever
525.16s: Let's go now to our current AY in our 
527.279s: Current AY, the before is just only I'm 
530.24s: Lifting you to me, but let us Ponder a
532.76s: Little bit about this purifying you from
535.44s: This believer meaning they will not be
537.88s: Able to put even one finger of their 
539.6s: Filthy finger on you, so it is impossible
542.8s: That they have apprehended him is no way 
545.76s: That they have detained detained him
547.68s: There's no way that they have tried him
549.6s: They, no way that they have spat they
551.76s: Have spat in his face, there's no way
553.959s: That they have taken his clothe, no way 
556.6s: That I have plugged him, no way that I
558.72s: Have put the the crown of Thor on his 
561.72s: Head, no way that I crucified him knowing
564.48s: That they have forced him to drink the
566.04s: Bitter drink, no they did Kill because
568.72s: All of them that is contradict
571.12s: Purification, that they don't even touch
573.079s: Him with their filthy fingers, so that
575.079s: Refus all of that in one go, and then
577.56s: After that he was lifted up, as the his
580.44s: Dis reported, we have in the current
583.04s: Existing New Testament, that that he has
587.079s: Been lifted after after the so-call
589.44s: Crucifixion, 40 or 50 days he Has Lifted
592.36s: In front of their eyes, that disappeared
593.92s: In the sky, so the lifting process, the
596.8s: Beginning of it is visible to them, they
598.48s: Have witnessed and they reported it
601.12s: After the sky, we don't know what has
602.48s: Happened, so the lifting process is part
604.16s: Of it 
605.2s: Is, and then this way I received you in
608.2s: Full to me, or clearly he was lifted with 
610.2s: His body in front of him, there was 
611.48s: Nobody lifting to for burial, anything so
614.839s: That's receiving, I will receive, we have
617.64s: To use the linguistic meaning, is it
619.72s: Causing to die, is it causing some people 
621.88s: Say because in the Quran when it applied 
625.16s: To human beings meaning usually caused
626.839s: To die, not necessary first of all we
629.399s: Have the famous Ayah in Surah what is I
632.68s: Think it is in in Z
641.0s: Allah, Allah is the one who received the
643.519s: Souls now the souls, not the bodies, not
645.76s: Not the whole beings, so when they die
649.32s: And also he sa the souls for those who
651.16s: Are in 
652.0s: Sleep, then he hold back the one he has 
654.6s: Been decided it should die and send the
656.88s: One back for a certain appointed time
659.12s: Time for a limited time, because it will
661.04s: Be one day taken away
663.76s: Anyway in this there are signs for
666.16s: People who Ponder and analyze, so it's
669.04s: Allah who does this, how is this this
671.72s: Process of taking the souls now the 
673.56s: Souls of us, or the spirits, or whatever
676.24s: You may express it in the case of death
679.12s: And the case of sleep is is a very
681.12s: Complex, and it is so far R we may know
684.279s: Some aspects of it, some bits, but in its
686.44s: Totality and its depth of meaning is r
689.48s: So that's where it is, they take that it 
691.639s: May be causing to anywhere in the Quran
693.92s: Who says about the
695.399s: People, the angel of death will will take
697.76s: You or when
699.399s: He theh saying, if I if we take you then
704.6s: If we let you see what we the punishment 
707.68s: The punishment of the Qur then, or we
710.16s: Take you in either case we are over them
712.519s: In control, we can do it, that's no
714.48s: Problem, so even if you see it or you
716.48s: Don't see it, they are under our power 
718.2s: Under our control, so this in the case of
720.2s: The 
722.519s: Is to be understood from the context
724.92s: That, if you cause you to die, so you
726.68s: Don't see the punishment of Qur, or you
728.56s: See the punishment in either case they 
730.24s: Are completely under our power, and
731.72s: Control, that's why the Quran
734.68s: Says in either case we we show you their
738.0s: Punishment, or we cause you to die before
740.44s: That, in either case they will come back
742.0s: To us, don't worry we will will manage
744.12s: Them here and there after, so that's why 
746.639s: The context will show there the meaning 
747.92s: Of that, but in this here
749.6s: The claim to cause to death is is
752.16s: Properous because it is after saying
754.519s: Lifted you, and we have know the lifting
756.68s: Is the lifting with body and soul
758.48s: According to the witnesses of the 
759.76s: Disciples, and there's no counter
761.6s: Information whatsoever in the Islamic
763.639s: Narratives that it is that the is
766.959s: Something else, the only what we have in
768.6s: History which as reliable as we could 
771.88s: Say, the the gospel's report is that he
775.0s: Has ascended in heaven, in front of the
777.32s: Eye and disappeared behind the sky, the 
779.36s: Clubs, that's it, so that's the meaning of
782.68s: Rece receiving you in
784.639s: Full, did he cause him to die, maybe did
788.24s: He cause him to be asleep like the
789.959s: People of the cave for thousand of years
792.12s: To come and come down again
794.44s: Maybe, maybe cause him to
797.639s: Die, initial death when which we be 
800.56s: Resurrected and come down again Earth
802.519s: Maybe, these are all possibilities, so the
804.6s: Translation, cause you to die, is is is is 
808.88s: Not proper in our context, now what we 
812.0s: Are studying here, there is no talking
814.959s: About receiv receiving, no talking about 
816.639s: Purification, because the issue here is 
819.48s: What happened to him, the essential
821.16s: Happen is that he's lifted up, so we go
823.72s: Back to our Surah, what does it say
826.519s: Here, after Allah denies that they they 
829.519s: That they killed
831.44s: Him, and accept that this is because they 
834.44s: Got the his appearance was was placed on 
838.16s: Someone else, and we discussed that last
840.199s: Time, that is all evidences point that it
842.72s: Is you, the traitor, you es scariot, but 
846.0s: With certainity, did not kill him, instead
848.839s: Indeed Allah lifted him to him, and Allah
851.68s: Is exalted and wise, and
853.72s: Perfectionist, so here is only ra, not
857.199s: Even causing to death to avoid any 
859.44s: Confusion that were coming after that
861.519s: That he has been by the lifting being
863.399s: Died, he has been received, but what is it 
866.04s: What's the nature of receiving, what is
867.92s: The process of receiving, the beginning
869.72s: Of it until this, until the clouds, is the
871.959s: Physical one, we see, although obviously
874.399s: For the for the disciples seeing that
876.88s: They didn't see any mechanism, maybe it's 
879.12s: Like, Scotty be me up and start Tre who
882.04s: Don't know, whatever process is, but after
884.279s: That he disappeared completely behind
886.24s: The the clouds, we don't know what has 
888.199s: Happened to him, did he evaporate, did he 
890.519s: Turn into light, that's all possible
892.92s: That's all, and by the way, all of this 
894.959s: Including the lifting in front of the of
897.44s: Of the dises, I, I said last time two
900.199s: Angels came down to him, I was mistaken
902.04s: The two angels came to tell them to go
903.519s: To Jerusalem and continue the dawa that
905.72s: Has nothing to do with with the lifting
907.44s: The lifting is just he was cut from them
909.32s: And then ascended immediately, that's it
912.519s: Without any Angels coming taking him
914.16s: From the light, or left, or anything like
915.68s: That, so we don't know what's this kind
917.36s: Of mechanis, so even in this process
919.12s: Which they have seen, it's a part of of
921.959s: Something miraculous and extraordinary
924.44s: Anyway, Isa, all his life is extraordinary
927.04s: And his mother, and the Quran
934.16s: In another
937.16s: Place, assign for the mankind, it's a f, is 
941.079s: A distinguish distinguished and unique 
944.36s: Ayah, which has never in history before
947.0s: After, so all things related to ISA seem
949.36s: To be miraculous and out of the ordinary
952.0s: So here in our Ayah, in our Surah only
954.759s: The lifting is mentioned because to
958.0s: Close in door of any possibility of
959.959s: Discussing of confusion of his death 
961.72s: Being previously which also someone 
963.8s: Could say because of the coming eyes
965.759s: After that, the famous AY, which we will
968.56s: Discuss today, and possibly maybe next
970.36s: Time, if it's not fully discussed today
973.079s: Is that some people may think it he has
975.319s: Died, that left thing, we should say he
977.399s: Has been received, what is the nature of
979.199s: Receiving, it is neither I would say the
981.72s: Best, is it is the receiving in a certain
986.279s: Miraculous hidden way which cannot be

##  KFA & its applicability to the West - Dr. Yasir Qadhi

**The notion of KFA being an obligation. Is it a priority for Muslims?** 
*Timestamp: 0:40*
*Category: Islamic Theology*
*Answer: The speaker, Yasir Qadhi, believes that while KFA is technically an obligation, it should not be a top priority for Muslims. He argues that most Muslims struggle with basic Islamic practices like prayer and ethical living, making it impractical to prioritize KFA over other fundamental aspects of faith. He suggests focusing on building a strong foundation in personal and communal faith before pursuing KFA.*

**What are the Quranic justifications for establishing Salah in a community?** 
*Timestamp: 1:15*
*Category: Islamic Jurisprudence*
*Answer: The speaker highlights two Quranic verses supporting the idea of establishing Salah within a community. The first verse, describing the creation of the Earth and the establishment of Salah, implies that Salah is not just individual prayer, but a system of governance and social order. The second verse references the collection of Zakat by an authority, highlighting the need for a governing body to manage communal funds and responsibilities. Overall, these verses emphasize the importance of establishing a system of governance and social order, which includes Salah and Zakat, for the well-being of the community.* 

**Is there an obligation to establish power and achieve political dominance?**
*Timestamp: 1:15*
*Category: Islamic Jurisprudence*
*Answer: The speaker asserts that there is no obligation to establish power in Islam. He argues that political dominance occurs through divine intervention, either by becoming a majority in a region or through conquest after a conflict. He rejects the notion of forceful conversion or imposing Islamic rule on a population through violence. Instead, he stresses the importance of individual Muslims living exemplary lives and advocating for Islamic principles within their communities.* 

**Is it permissible for Muslims to live outside the Islamic domain?**
*Timestamp: 4:00*
*Category: Islamic Jurisprudence*
*Answer: The speaker argues that it is permissible for Muslims to live outside the Islamic domain, citing the example of the Muslims who migrated to Abyssinia for 15 years before returning to Medina. He suggests that living in non-Muslim lands, particularly for temporary reasons like study or work, is permissible as long as Muslims can maintain their Islamic identity and practices.  He emphasizes that KFA should not be considered the ultimate goal, but rather a tool to be utilized when circumstances allow.* 

**What about the notion that a KFA would have prevented past tragedies, specifically in Andalusia?**
*Timestamp: 7:50*
*Category: Islamic History*
*Answer: The speaker rejects the claim that a KFA would have prevented tragedies like the fall of Andalusia. He argues that this notion is overly romanticized, ignoring the complexities of Islamic history, including the frequent conflicts and power struggles between Muslims. He stresses that power corrupts and that even a pious leader cannot guarantee peace or prosperity without sufficient military and political strength. He also points out that the Andalusian Muslims faced significant challenges, including the rise of the Spanish Empire, which even a powerful KFA could not have easily overcome.* 

**What is the speaker's stance on criticizing those who are actively working towards change?**
*Timestamp: 9:55*
*Category: Islamic Ethics*
*Answer: The speaker strongly criticizes armchair criticism, particularly when it comes to those actively striving to make a difference in difficult situations. He argues that it is more productive to support those who are working to address issues like genocide and oppression, even if their approaches differ from our own. He uses the analogy of giving a date, highlighting that even small contributions towards a common goal are more valuable than empty criticism. He encourages Muslims to actively engage in the fight for justice and not to be paralyzed by the pursuit of an idealized KFA that may be unattainable in the current context.* 

**Is the speaker in favor of establishing a unified Islamic block?**
*Timestamp: 11:40*
*Category: Political Economy*
*Answer: The speaker proposes the creation of a unified Islamic block, similar to the European Union, as a realistic alternative to the pursuit of a singular KFA. He argues that Muslim countries, united by shared values and beliefs, could work together to advance Muslim causes and enhance their global influence. He cites the example of the European Union's formation as evidence that such a unity is possible and beneficial. However, he emphasizes that this should not be driven by a desire for power, but rather by a genuine commitment to the well-being of the Ummah.*

86.68s: The only thing which Abu Bakr did is that all these many have been cross-referencing together and one master copy this may hint that the copy of the Quran which could have been a master one taken by most likely was not replaced because he took it in the 10th year and then the was busy with other things was busy preparing for Hajj.  
The speaker clarifies that Abu Bakr's role was not to collect the Quran but to verify and collate existing copies. This process resulted in a master copy, likely a replacement of an earlier one. Abu Bakr's focus on this task was limited due to other responsibilities, such as Hajj preparations.  

## Why was the master copy of the Quran kept at the house of the Prophet? 
**Category:** Quranic Text 
149.319s: Master copy which is should be saved in the house of the prophet and we discuss why it was saved by H not of atism but because I think H was the only one who was mastering reading and writing so it doesn’t make any sense to keep a copy so people can copy from it or she can read to be able to dictate to them unless one of the wives is is is is first class reader and writer and it's the only one was that's the reason nothing netism or any place standing if it would have been any place of standing in good relation to the prophet it would have been or not but neither of these two seem to be literate so that's that's so this is the fiction which people have because they did not scrutinize all the reports.

He emphasizes that the availability of parchment and other materials for writing indicated a sufficient number of copies, refuting the idea that the Quran was written on primitive materials like rocks or camel shoulders.

## Did Abu Bakr have a master copy of the Quran made because he had a vision or a specific instruction? 
**Category:** Quranic Text
269.84s: Because the master cop kept at the house of the was taken by and after after Abu Bakr is obviously not a memorizer nor he is really he was not attending daily to the prophet as we know he's admitted himself and he urged Abu Bakr to have a Master Copy and was relying or these copies available we say no no we have to have one in the center of we should take a sound and good and solid idea ultimately was pursued which is an excellent idea indeed and they wrote a copy and they wrote a copy from the it is a copy from the copy of but they did a further step of verification.

The speaker emphasizes that the material used to write the Quran during the time of Abu Bakr was predominantly parchment. This is based on the fact that the Makka and Medina Quranic verses had been already transferred to parchments and likely bound together.  

## Were there tablets and rocks used to write the Quran? 
**Category:** Quranic Text
407.8s: From things like that that that's the narrator adding from his imagination he thinking he's getting whatever they have in their hand I don’t think the the the tablets and the rocks and the pieces of rocks and things like what they in Makkah and Madina I think they all have been transcribed in complete many before that long ago or in parchment and they have enough with and money before two three years before the death of a Prophet that they will be able to afford to have everything in in in Yen very nice smooth parchment it couldn’t be possibly that rocks and things but the narrator they brought whatever they have and then he added from his imagination all of these other things which were were gone already long ago because the Quran was combined according to narration of Abd Allah.

## What was the outcome of the Israeli operation to free hostages? 
**Category:** Military

The Israeli operation to free hostages was a disaster. The operation resulted in the deaths of three hostages, with Hamas claiming that there may be more. The operation also involved the use of civilian vehicles and humanitarian aid vehicles, which is a war crime. The Israelis have been criticized for their use of force, with many analysts claiming that the operation was disproportionate.

The Israeli forces are no longer in control of any areas of Gaza, with the exception of the southern strip, which is controlled by Egypt. The Israelis are suffering continuous ambushes and attacks, resulting in an estimated 10 to 50 deaths per day. 

## What happened with Benny Gantz after the operation?
**Category:** Politics

Benny Gantz resigned from the war cabinet after the operation. This is attributed to personal conflicts with Netanyahu, who is seen as a criminal by Gantz. Gantz's resignation led to the dissolution of the war cabinet, which was a group approved by the wider cabinet to discuss and manage the war efforts. This does not change Netanyahu's majority in parliament and therefore does not bring the government to a vote.

## What is the relationship between the IDF and the government?
**Category:** Politics

The relationship between the IDF and the government seems to be increasingly strained.

This indicates that the IDF is pushing for a negotiated settlement, while the government is pushing for complete annihilation of Hamas.

## Is the US involved in the war?
**Category:**  US Involvement

While there is no irrefutable evidence that American Delta Forces participated in the shooting, there is a possibility that they were present for backup operations. There is evidence suggesting that American forces may have participated in the operation, but no definitive proof exists yet. The operation would be a significant setback for America's reputation if they are indeed proven to be involved. 

## What is the current US position on the war?
**Category:** US Position

The US is currently pushing for a negotiated settlement with Hezbollah, offering them billions of dollars in bribes and possibly lifting sanctions on Iran. This is similar to their previous attempt to negotiate with Hezbollah in November of last year, which resulted in a major mistake for the US. The US did not step in when Hezbollah attacked an American aircraft carrier, leading to a perceived weakness and emboldening Hezbollah. 

## Why is the US not taking a more active role in the war?
**Category:** US Position

The US is likely refraining from taking a more active role in the war because they are concerned about the potential for a nuclear escalation. If Israel were to use tactical nuclear weapons, Iran would likely retaliate, leading to a potential global nuclear war. The US is therefore pushing for a conventional war, avoiding any crossing of the nuclear barrier.

## What is the latest development regarding the Israeli-Lebanese conflict?
**Category:** Military Situation 

The Israeli military is currently moving one more division towards the Lebanese border, while scaling down their efforts in Gaza to a persistence level. This suggests that Israel is preparing for a possible attack on Lebanon.

Israel is planning to attack Lebanon, potentially using B52s and carpet bombing. However, they are currently facing pressure from inside the US to give up the idea.  The US is worried about the potential for escalation, but the Israeli government is seemingly determined to go through with it.

## What are the potential consequences of an Israeli attack on Lebanon?
**Category:** Military Situation

If Israel attacks Lebanon, it is likely to result in a heavy loss of civilian lives. However, it could also lead to the end of Hezbollah, as they may not be able to withstand a prolonged conflict with Israel.

## What are the key challenges for the Palestinian Authority?
**Category:** Politics

The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is currently facing internal challenges. The current leader, Abbas, is in poor health, and his death is expected soon. This has led to internal power struggles between different factions who are vying for control. 

## What is the future of the war?
**Category:** Analysis

The future of the war is uncertain. If the Israeli attack against Lebanon is cancelled, it is likely that the conflict will continue for several months before a negotiated settlement is reached. However, if the attack does happen, it could lead to a rapid escalation and end the conflict within a few months. 

## What is the significance of the Russian-Korean treaty?
**Category:** Politics

The Russian-Korean treaty is significant because it strengthens Russia's position in the region and demonstrates their willingness to challenge the US's dominance. The treaty also allows for the transfer of nuclear technology and weapons to Korea, which could potentially destabilize the region.

## Why is it important for countries to have nuclear weapons?
**Category:** Politics

According to Alexander Duan, a Russian philosopher, nuclear weapons are essential for national sovereignty in the current world order. He argues that the West's imperialistic desires and hegemonic ambitions necessitate the use of nuclear weapons as a deterrent.

**Answer:** The speaker argues that the explanation for the existence of things that are not nothing lies in the fact that existence is fundamental.  Nothingness is impossible, and there must be at least one necessarily existing being.

## Question 20: 1613.84s
**Category:** Necessary Existence
**Question:** How do we prove that there is a necessary being?
**Answer:** The speaker acknowledges that proving a necessary being is not easy, as many people have denied its existence. However, they argue that once we exist, we cannot have created ourselves from nothing, implying a necessary being. 

## Question 21: 1628.88s
**Category:** Contingency
**Question:** How do we know that we are not necessary beings?
**Answer:** The speaker points out that we perceive ourselves as contingent beings, recognizing our beginning and dependence on other things.  If we were necessary beings, we would possess an attribute of necessity that does not align with our self-perception.

## Question 22: 1683.6s
**Category:**  Causality and Existence
**Question:** Why is it impossible for something to come into existence from nothing?
**Answer:** The speaker reiterates that it's a fallacy to suggest something comes into existence from nothing.  They argue that it's a deception playing with words, as it is impossible for something to be created from a state of absolute nothingness.

## Question 23: 1723.039s
**Category:** Causality Principle
**Question:** What is the essence of the causality principle?
**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that the causality principle states that nothing can begin to exist without something bringing it into existence.  This is a necessary principle, and denying it leads to contradictions.

## Question 24: 1780.64s
**Category:** Self-Creation
**Question:** Why is self-creation impossible? 
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the concept of self-creation is impossible because it implies that something is both the cause and the effect of its own existence.  This creates a vicious circle, as the entity must exist before it can be a creator, leading to a contradiction.

## Question 25: 1881.84s
**Category:** Contingency in Reality
**Question:** Is there any evidence of a necessary being in reality? 
**Answer:** The speaker points out that we observe contingency in reality, as nothing seems to be necessary except potentially the universe as a whole.  They argue that components of the universe, such as galaxies and stars, seem to be contingent.

## Question 26: 1917.039s
**Category:**  Unity of Reality
**Question:** Is the multiplicity we see in reality simply an illusion, with everything ultimately being a single interconnected entity?
**Answer:** The speaker acknowledges that this is a potential counterargument, suggesting that the universe might be a single unity with interconnected parts. However, they suggest that assuming a degree of separation between entities is reasonable, at least based on our current understanding of the universe.

## Question 27: 1964.799s
**Category:** Causal Chains
**Question:** How does the concept of causal chains relate to the search for a necessary being?
**Answer:** The speaker explains that when we observe changes and phenomena, we are looking for their causes.  If these causes themselves have causes, we are presented with a chain of causes that might lead to a necessary being, which is the uncaused cause at the beginning of the chain. 

## Question 28: 2033.919s
**Category:**  Necessary Being
**Question:** What does it mean for a being to be uncaused?
**Answer:**  A being is uncaused if it has no cause whatsoever for its existence.  This implies that it is genuinely self-contained and does not need anything else to exist. 

## Question 29: 2056.24s
**Category:** Middle Probability
**Question:** What happens if the first cause in the chain of causes is not uncaused?
**Answer:** If the first cause in the chain is not uncaused, it implies the existence of an intermediary cause. This intermediary cause, according to Ibn Sina, has the "middle probability," as it is both caused and causing.

## Question 30: 2118.96s
**Category:**  Middle Probability Example
**Question:** Can you give an example to clarify the middle probability?
**Answer:** The speaker uses the example of a screen that emits light. The screen itself is caused by other things, but it is also causing the light to be emitted.  This screen represents the "middle probability" as it is both a cause and an effect.

## Question 31: 2351.52s
**Category:** Infinite Regress
**Question:** Why is the term "infinite regress" a misnomer?
**Answer:** The speaker argues that "infinite regress" is a misnomer because it implies an infinite number of members in the chain of causes. This is not the case, as the term "infinite" here refers to having no beginning, not an infinite number of elements.

## Question 32: 2409.44s
**Category:** Infinite Regress and Set Theory
**Question:** What type of infinity is relevant to the discussion of infinite regress?
**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that the relevant type of infinity in this context is one that has no border and does not converge to a beginning. This can be represented by a countable or uncountable set, as long as it has no limit. 

## Question 33: 2542.319s
**Category:**  Middle Probability in Infinite Regress
**Question:** Does the middle probability apply to every element in an infinite regress? 
**Answer:** The speaker clarifies that every element in an infinite regress has the middle probability, meaning they are both caused and causing. While this may seem paradoxical, the key is that each member is necessary for the existence of the chain.

## Question 34: 2600.16s
**Category:** Infinite Regress and Convergence
**Question:** If every element in an infinite regress has the middle probability, doesn't that mean it has no beginning?
**Answer:** The speaker explains that while every element is both caused and causing, this doesn't mean the regress has no beginning. The middle probability necessitates an ultimate cause, which is the beginning of the chain.

## Question 35: 2623.76s
**Category:** Infinite Regress and Mathematics
**Question:** How can we use mathematics to illustrate the convergence of an infinite regress?
**Answer:** The speaker proposes assigning values to the elements in the series, creating a mapping between the series and a set. By defining a function that assigns the value 1 to elements with the middle property and 0 to those without, the resulting series converges to 1, implying the existence of a beginning.

## Question 36: 2829.2s
**Category:** Infinite Regress and Convergence
**Question:** How does mathematics prove that an infinite regress with the middle property must have a beginning? 
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the infinite series, which allegedly has no limit, can be proven to converge using mathematical tools like topology.  They show that the mapping between the series and a set with the middle property leads to a convergent series, implying the existence of a limit, or a beginning.

## Question 37: 2870.96s
**Category:**  Infinite Regress and Necessary Conditions
**Question:** What is the crucial point about the middle probability and the necessary conditions for the existence of an infinite regress? 
**Answer:** The speaker stresses that the infinite regress is not just about causes and effects, but about necessary conditions. Each member is a necessary condition for the existence of the chain, meaning if any member is removed, the chain breaks.

## Question 38: 2930.8s
**Category:** Middle Property and Ibn Sina
**Question:** Who first introduced the concept of the middle property?
**Answer:** The speaker credits Ibn Sina (Avicenna) with introducing the concept of the middle probability.  They suggest that this concept is better understood through mathematical tools like topology, which are well-developed and reliable.

## Question 39: 3081.76s
**Category:** Causality vs. Necessity
**Question:** Is full causality necessary to prove that an infinite regress is impossible?
**Answer:** The speaker argues that full causality is not necessary to prove the impossibility of an infinite regress. Instead, the concept of necessity is sufficient.  Each member in the chain needs the previous one as a necessary condition for its existence.

## Question 40: 3147.2s
**Category:**  Causality vs. Sufficiency
**Question:** What is the difference between a cause and a sufficient condition?
**Answer:** The speaker explains that in Arabic, there is a distinction between 'cause' and 'sufficient condition.' A cause is both necessary and sufficient, while a sufficient condition is not necessarily a cause.  This distinction is relevant for legal and practical applications.

## Question 41: 3264.24s
**Category:** Arabic Philosophy
**Question:** How is the distinction between causality and sufficiency relevant in Islamic philosophy?
**Answer:** The speaker explains that the distinction between causality and sufficiency is important in Islamic philosophy, particularly for legal aspects and practical matters.  They argue that these two concepts have different legal implications.

##  0:46.16s - Deception of God 
**Category:** Quran Interpretation

**Question:** The speaker discusses the meaning of the Arabic phrase "He is the one who is deceiving them" in the Quran,  pointing out that it's interpreted as "deceiving themselves" in some translations. Why do translators choose this interpretation?

**Answer:**  The speaker believes some translators avoid attributing deception directly to God, fearing it would portray him as a deceiver. Instead, they interpret the verse as the Hypocrites deceiving themselves, aligning with the concept of God causing people to be deceived by their own actions.

## 1:160.159s -  "My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?"
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses the famous phrase "My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?" from the Bible. What is the speaker's interpretation of this utterance? 

**Answer:**  The speaker argues that this phrase, attributed to Jesus, was likely uttered by someone else and not Jesus.  He points to the use of Aramaic, which is rare in the New Testament, and suggests that the phrase represents the speaker's feeling of despair and abandonment in the face of suffering, rather than a literal declaration of God's abandonment. 

## 1:354.159s -  Mentioning Evil Openly
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses a Quranic verse that states that God does not like evil to be mentioned openly. What is the speaker's interpretation of this verse?

**Answer:**  The speaker interprets this verse as a call for promoting positive speech and avoiding unnecessary gossip or spreading negativity within society.  He argues that mentioning evil is permissible only when someone has been wronged and needs to voice their grievance.

## 1:500.279s -  Good Deeds Publicly and Privately
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses the importance of performing good deeds both publicly and privately. What is the speaker's main point about this?

**Answer:**  While acknowledging the potential for pride and showing off when doing good deeds publicly, the speaker encourages both public and private acts of kindness. He suggests that doing good in public can serve as a positive example for others, while doing good in private can offer greater rewards and avoid potential temptations.

## 1:640.079s - Hypocrites and Their Motivation
**Category:** Quran Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses the hypocrisy of certain individuals.  What is their primary motivation for hypocrisy?

**Answer:**  The speaker argues that the main reason for hypocrisy is a desire for worldly gain.  Individuals may feign belief to maintain social standing, business opportunities, or protection from potential enemies.

## 2:1160.159s -  God's Responsiveness to Gratitude
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

**Question:** The speaker addresses a Quranic verse that states that God is responsive to gratitude. Why is this a significant attribute of God?

**Answer:**  The speaker emphasizes that despite God's control over all things, He still values gratitude from His creation.  This indicates a  Divine attribute of appreciation and kindness, reminding us that even in our limitations, our efforts and good intentions hold meaning and are acknowledged by God.

## 2:1775.919s -  Denying God and His Messengers
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses a category of individuals who claim to believe in God but deny His messengers. What is the speaker's assessment of this type of disbelief?

**Answer:**  The speaker considers this denial of messengers to be a severe form of disbelief. He argues that accepting God as the Creator but rejecting His messengers and their guidance is illogical and represents a profound misunderstanding of the Divine order. 

## 2:2213.88s -  Demands of the People of the Book
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:** The speaker describes a specific demand made by the People of the Book (specifically the Jews) from the Prophet Muhammad. What is this demand?

**Answer:**  The speaker states that the Jews demanded that the Prophet physically receive a book from heaven, a request that echoes a similar demand they made from Moses. The speaker sees this demand as indicative of their stubbornness and disbelief, as they had already been given ample evidence of God's power through Moses' miracles.

## 2:3065.76s -  Punishment for Broken Covenant
**Category:** Quran Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses the punishment that will be inflicted upon the People of the Book. What is the main reason for this punishment?

**Answer:**  The speaker attributes the punishment to the People of the Book breaking their covenant with God, rejecting His signs, unjustly killing prophets, and falsely claiming that their hearts are sealed with knowledge. He emphasizes that God has sealed their hearts due to their disbelief, rendering them incapable of truly receiving new knowledge.

## 2:3400.28s -  Slander Against Mary
**Category:**  Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker mentions an additional reason for the punishment of the People of the Book. What is this reason?

**Answer:**  The speaker emphasizes that the People of the Book spread slander against Mary, the mother of Jesus, further contributing to their punishment. This highlights the severity of the sin of spreading false accusations and denigrating those who are innocent.

## 2:3465.119s -  The Killing of the Messiah
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker addresses a boastful statement made by the People of the Book about the killing of Jesus. What is the speaker's response to this claim?

**Answer:**  The speaker unequivocally refutes the claim, stating that Jesus was neither killed nor crucified. He argues that the Jews were only made to believe that this happened through a divine Transfiguration, where a traitor was transformed into Jesus' image. He further points out that those who insist on the crucifixion are confused and lack true knowledge, relying on conjecture rather than verifiable evidence.

## 2:4793.639s -  The Death of Jesus
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker describes the death of Jesus. How does he account for this event?

**Answer:**  The speaker believes that Jesus died as a result of extreme physical pain, possibly combined with a heart attack or neurological collapse induced by the ordeal. He dismisses accounts of a spear being used to check for Jesus' death as insignificant details.  The speaker sees the utterance "My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?" as a sign of Jesus' human vulnerability in the face of intense suffering, rather than a testament to divine abandonment.

## 2:5330.96s -  The Significance of Jesus' Resurrection
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker acknowledges that the resurrection of Jesus is a central belief for Christians. Why does he consider it a reappearance rather than a resurrection?

**Answer:** The speaker believes that Jesus did not actually die and was only made to appear as if he had. He suggests that this event was a Transfiguration, a miraculous event where Jesus was transformed and appeared to be someone else. Therefore, what Christians call the resurrection, the speaker interprets as a reappearance.

## 2:5657.56s -  The Disappearance of Judas 
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker discusses the disappearance of Judas, the traitor.  What is the most plausible explanation for his disappearance?

**Answer:** The speaker suggests that Judas was present during Jesus' apprehension and was transformed into Jesus' image through a Transfiguration, ultimately leading to Jesus being apprehended. He argues that this event would have caused Judas to be in a state of shock and leave him incapable of any further action. He disappears from history because he was no longer necessary.

## 2:5776.52s -  Jesus' Reappearance
**Category:** Biblical Interpretation

**Question:**  The speaker briefly mentions another controversial event. What is this event?

**Answer:**  The speaker refers to the event of Jesus reappearing after his supposed death, which has become a topic of much debate and speculation. The speaker promises to address this event in a future discussion.

**5:81.16**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker states that in Surah Yusuf, ayah 41, Yusuf is asked to explain the dreams of the prisoners. What were the dreams of the two prisoners?
* **Answer:** One prisoner dreamed of serving the king with wine, while the other dreamed of carrying bread above his head from which birds were eating. 

**6:12.04**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker describes the potential reason for one prisoner being in prison. What might have happened?
* **Answer:** The speaker suggests that one prisoner, who was the king's cupbearer, may have been accused of poisoning or some other offense, leading to his imprisonment pending investigation.

**6:30.92**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** The speaker explains that the prisoner who dreamed of carrying bread will be crucified. What is the speaker's point about the dream's interpretation?
* **Answer:** The speaker explains that the dream signifies the prisoner's guilt, but he acknowledges that the specific details regarding the prisoner's true guilt or innocence are not addressed in Surah Yusuf.

* **Question:** The speaker highlights a specific detail in Surah Yusuf, ayah 41, which suggests that Yusuf was already receiving prophethood at that time. What is this detail? 
* **Answer:**  Yusuf states that the matter concerning the prisoners' future has already been decided by God. This demonstrates his prophetic knowledge, as he could see the future and affirm its predetermined nature.

**7:14.36**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** The speaker distinguishes between general dreams and the prophetic interpretation of dreams. How does he differentiate them?
* **Answer:**  The speaker notes that while true dreams can be experienced by anyone, the interpretation of dreams and the ability to establish something based on their meaning is often fallible unless the interpreter is a prophet.

**7:78.16**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** The speaker discusses the significance of Yusuf's interpretation of the prisoners' dreams in relation to the concept of free will. What is his main point?
* **Answer:**  Yusuf's accurate interpretation of the dreams demonstrates that the future, while open, has been decided by God. It supports the idea that while people may have free will, God's plan will ultimately unfold.

**8:22.88**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  Some scholars connect the issue of the prisoners' disputing their dreams to the reason for their imprisonment. What is the speaker's opinion about this?
* **Answer:** The speaker disagrees with this interpretation, suggesting that the prisoners' dispute over the dreams is not the primary reason for their imprisonment. He believes that the reason is related to the prisoner's potential poisoning accusation and the bread maker's potential crime, as mentioned in the Old Testament.

**8:58.639**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Yusuf's prophecy regarding the prisoners. What is his point about Yusuf's prophetic ability?
* **Answer:** Yusuf's prophecy about the prisoners is a testament to his infallibility, as he can accurately interpret dreams and predict future events. This further strengthens his prophetic role.

**8:89.199**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** Yusuf knows which prisoner will be released and which one will be crucified. Why does he need to clarify which one is the cupbearer?
* **Answer:**  While the dreams might not clearly indicate which prisoner is who, Yusuf's knowledge of their fates allows him to clarify that the cupbearer will be released. 

**9:47.88**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** What is the first translation of the next ayah?
* **Answer:** The first translation of the next ayah is: “And thereon Joseph said unto the one of two whom he considered saved: Mention me unto thy Lord when thou art free. But Satan caused him to forget to mention Joseph to his Lord, and he remained in prison a few more years.”

**9:91.399**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  What is the second translation of the next ayah?
* **Answer:** The second translation is: “Joseph said to the one he knew would be saved: Mention me to your master when you are free. But Satan cursed him to forget to mention Joseph to his master, and so he remained in prison for a fewer more years.”

**10:06.24**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** The speaker states that the second translation is more accurate than the first. Why does the speaker think the first translation is inaccurate?
* **Answer:**  The speaker believes that the first translation is inaccurate because it uses the word "the one" which in the Quran can imply uncertainty or wavering, which is not the case in this ayah. Yusuf had a definite knowledge of which prisoner would be saved, as he was a prophet.

**10:51.6**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker explores the concept of "the one" as used in the Quran. Why might a prophet have nagging doubts?
* **Answer:**  The speaker acknowledges that even prophets might experience fleeting doubts, due to the limitations of the human mind and brain. This doesn't negate their prophethood but highlights the human aspect of their experience.

**11:32.919**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  Yusuf instructs the prisoner to mention him to the king when he is freed. How does the speaker explain Yusuf's motivation for this?
* **Answer:**  The speaker explains that Yusuf is asking the prisoner to remind the king about his situation, hoping to be released from prison. This is because the king was previously told about Yusuf's situation when the prisoner first sought his help.

**11:82.6**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The Quran mentions that Satan causes the freed prisoner to forget about Yusuf's request. How does the speaker explain this detail?
* **Answer:** The speaker finds this detail interesting, as a significant event like Yusuf's request should remain in someone's memory. He suggests that Satan might indeed have the power to make people forget things, particularly those that could bring about good change.

**12:25.96**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker discusses different interpretations of the role of Satan in this instance. What are the two main interpretations?
* **Answer:**  The speaker suggests that Satan's role in causing the prisoner to forget could either be a literal interpretation, meaning an actual entity influencing the prisoner, or a metaphorical interpretation, reflecting the inherent imperfection and weakness inherent in all created beings. 

**12:75.159**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker connects the concept of Satan to modern psychology. How does he connect the two?
* **Answer:**  The speaker suggests that the Quran's concept of Satan, particularly in this instance, could be understood in light of modern psychology's understanding of the subconscious or unconscious mind and its potential for causing mental problems and forgetfulness. 

**13:01.44**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** What is the speaker's point about the prisoners' forgetting of Yusuf's request in the context of a prophecy?
* **Answer:** The speaker highlights the irony of the situation. Despite the profound impact of Yusuf's request and the miraculous nature of the visions the prisoners experienced, the prisoner forgets about Yusuf, demonstrating that even in the face of divine intervention, human weakness can still prevail.

**13:41.2**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  Some scholars ask the question, why didn't Allah prevent the prisoner from forgetting Yusuf? What is the speaker's response?
* **Answer:**  The speaker suggests that some scholars see Allah's action in allowing the prisoner to forget as a form of discipline for Yusuf, for putting his hope in the king and the prisoner instead of relying solely on Allah. 

**14:12.52**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker explains that Allah's actions in this instance could be seen from a mystical perspective. How does he explain this mystical interpretation?
* **Answer:**  The speaker suggests that Allah might have allowed Satan to influence the prisoner as a test for Yusuf, forcing him to rely solely on Allah's guidance, and demonstrating the importance of complete devotion to God even in the face of human requests and support.

**14:84.2**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:**  The speaker explores the contradiction between Yusuf's request for the prisoner to remind the king about him, and the subsequent actions of the prisoner. Why does the speaker believe Allah might have allowed this to happen?
* **Answer:** The speaker argues that Yusuf, despite his high rank and understanding, might have relied too much on the human factor in this situation, thus forgetting the importance of complete dependence on Allah. Allah's allowing the forgetfulness, therefore, could be seen as a test for Yusuf, pushing him to rely solely on divine intervention.

**15:10.2**
* **Category:** Quran
* **Question:** How long does the speaker believe Yusuf spent in prison, based on the details of the story?
* **Answer:** The speaker estimates that Yusuf spent at least three years but possibly up to nine years in prison, adding to the overall timeline of his 18-20 years in Egypt.

**16:21.2**

## 26th of May Palestine Update 21

**Can you give us a brief update on the situation in Palestine?** 
Category: Battlefield Situation

Yesterday or today, it seems that a group of Israeli soldiers entered a tunnel. The Hamas Report confirmed that the entire group was destroyed with few taken as prisoners of war. The Israeli government denied that any soldiers were kidnapped. 

**What about the other developments in the past week?** 
Category: Battlefield Situation

On average, about 10 armored vehicles or tanks are destroyed per day. Hamas is using a new tactic in the north of Gaza in the Jabalia camp. They let the Israeli soldiers enter and then attack them from a distance with a large number of vehicles. This leads to a zero-distance attack from the back, which is becoming more common. 

**There was a meeting in Tehran between the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and resistance groups. Can you talk about that?** 
Category: Political Development

There was a meeting in Tehran between the IRGC and various resistance groups from Yemen, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, including leftist and secular groups, excluding Fatah. The meeting was to discuss future actions and the potential implications remain to be seen.

**Can you explain the recent judgment from the ICJ?**
Category: Political Development

The International Court of Justice issued an injunction, prompted by South Africa's application, later joined by Libya, Colombia, and Ecuador. Egypt denied any involvement, despite claims from South Africa. Turkey also announced support, but took no action, hinting at deception.  The injunction focused on stopping the invasion of Rafah, ensuring access for humanitarian aid and calling for international observers and investigators. 

**Why did the ICJ not include a ceasefire in the injunction?**
Category: International Law

The ICJ intentionally omitted the ceasefire issue. This strategy places the United States in a difficult position, as the court requires security council enforcement. Any attempt to execute the injunction can be vetoed by the US, however, public opinion within the US seems to oppose the invasion of Rafah. 

**Can you elaborate on the arrest warrants issued by the ICC?**
Category: International Law

The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor has issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yair Lapid and three Hamas leaders. The warrants against Netanyahu and Lapid are more comprehensive and address events post-October 7th. The warrants against the Hamas leaders appear politically motivated, based on false claims and lacking evidence of investigation or victim interviews.

**What are the possible ramifications of the arrest warrants?**
Category: International Law

It's highly likely the ICC will issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Lapid, but might find insufficient evidence for the Hamas leaders. The arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Lapid will cause significant anger within the United States. 

**There are certain drafts of laws regarding the ICC in the United States. What's happening there?**
Category: International Law

One draft law has already passed the House and is being considered by the Senate. If passed, this law would sanction the ICC prosecutor and the court itself. This would create a negative international image for the United States and potentially lead to additional sanctions. 

**What else is happening on the international stage?**
Category: International Development

The US Coalition has requested the shipment of supplies to Israel. These shipments are regularly made and approved semi-automatically, bypassing the White House. The recent shipment may be linked to potential interference with Iranian GPS systems. 

**Can you provide any details on the Iranian president's recent visit to Armenia?**
Category: Foreign Relations

The Iranian President's visit to Armenia was cut short. This may be due to a recent agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan regarding the disputed territory of Karabakh, which could potentially weaken Israel's influence in the region.  

**Can you explain the helicopter crash in Iran?**
Category: Military Development

The Iranian president's helicopter crash was likely caused by GPS interference. The helicopter, a Soviet-era model, was likely equipped with Western electronics, potentially containing backdoors exploited by the Israelis. 

**What are the implications of the crash for the future?**
Category: Military Development

The crash has raised suspicions of foul play. The incident may serve as justification for Iran to attack Israel or attempt to do so. 

**What is happening with the strategic study center in the United Arab Emirates?**
Category: Political Analysis

A strategic study center in the UAE, recently established, has begun publishing analyses that suggest a conflict between RI and the possible successor to the current Imam. This could be a tactic to create internal conflict and instability within Iran. 

**Can you sum up the current situation?**
Category: Overall Analysis

The situation in Palestine and the wider Middle East is in constant flux. The ICJ's injunction, the ICC's arrest warrants, and the Iranian president's helicopter crash are significant developments. While the exact implications are still unfolding, the potential for further conflict is high.

**Question:** What is the meaning of Ayah 44 of Surah Al-An'am?

**Category:**  Future
**Question:** Why is it impossible for the future to be known beforehand?

**Category:**  Divine Knowledge
**Question:**  What is the basis of Divine Knowledge?

**Category:**  Meaning
**Question:**  What is the main meaning of the verse where people meet on Judgement Day and realize they didn't stay on Earth for long?

This reinforces the importance of making the most of our time in this life. 

## 10:31.72s
**Category:**  Resurrection
**Question:** What happens after people are resurrected and realize the shortness of their time on Earth?

**Category:**  Guidance
**Question:** Why are communities that have received a distorted message or have not been able to verify it not held accountable?

**Category:**  Waste of Energy
**Question:** Why is it a waste of energy to speculate about the fate of communities that did not receive a message?

## 20:66.919s
**Category:**  Timing 
**Question:** Is it possible to say with certainty when the Day of Judgement will occur?

## 20:84.359s
**Category:**  Stupid Question
**Question:** Why is asking "when" the Day of Judgement will occur a "stupid question"?
**Answer:** The speaker argues that asking "when" the Day of Judgement will occur is pointless as it is inevitable. The speaker suggests that we should instead focus on our own preparations for that day, as it is far more important to be ready for our personal Judgement than to speculate about the exact timing of a universal event. 

## 21:39.24s
**Category:**  Personal Judgement
**Question:** When does our individual hour of Judgement occur? 
**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that our personal Judgement begins at the moment of our death.  We enter a state of sleep, good or bad depending on our deeds, until the Day of Resurrection. This highlights the importance of preparing for our death and our accountability to Allah.

## 23:35.119s
**Category:**  Recreating 
**Question:** How is it possible for Allah to recreate beings after they die? 
**Answer:** The speaker compares the process of resurrection to backing up data on a computer and loading it onto a new one. Allah, with his unlimited power, can recreate a new body, potentially in a different universe, and load our essence, our consciousness, and our memories onto it. This demonstrates that the resurrection is not outside the realm of possibility, but rather a testament to Allah's immense power. 

## 25:20.64s
**Category:**  Possibility
**Question:** Why is the resurrection of the dead not impossible? 
**Answer:** The speaker uses the analogy of backing up computer data to demonstrate the feasibility of resurrection.

## 26:38.359s
**Category:**  Irrationality
**Question:**  Why is it irrational to ask Allah for punishment? 
**Answer:** The speaker points out that it is irrational to ask for punishment instead of guidance. When people are presented with the truth, they should seek to understand it and embrace it, not to hasten a consequence that will ultimately bring them harm. 

## 28:00.52s
**Category:**  Mentality
**Question:** What does the speaker's story about the man who swore at God illustrate about the human mentality?

**Question:** How does the speaker connect the lack of intellectual engagement amongst Muslims to a warning from the prophet? 
**Answer:** The speaker refers to a prophecy by the Prophet Muhammad that warned Muslims would follow the steps of the Jews and Christians, even in their deviations.

## 30:10.04s
**Category:**  Worship 
**Question:**  What is the speaker's point about the meaning of worship?

## What is your personal view based on your understanding of the Quran, of the obligation of establishing the khilafah? Is it something that is, and if so, the level of obligation, and where do we get this from? Is it something that is, is it something from the Quran? Is it something that is necessary, or is it something that is desirable? So what is the role of the khilafah in our discourse as Muslims?

He argues that a singular global leadership would be a desirable outcome, but not a necessary or sufficient cause for Islamic revival. 

## The question itself is quite loaded: what is it, or is it desirable, not desirable? Let us let us see where the where the the people are usually coming from.

The speaker explains that the historical starting point for the Khilafah is the appointment of Abu Bakr as the head of state after the Prophet's death. He highlights the assumption that the Prophet's da'wah progressed in three phases: 1) semi-private da'wah, 2) educating the masses about the key features of the da'wah, and 3) establishing the khilafah with the help of allies. He then contrasts the Prophet's approach to seeking protection with the rise of groups like ISIS, who claimed to establish a khilafah despite lacking the necessary authority and support. 

## The question is: is it an obligation? Obligation does not make any sense if a state like that emerges naturally. 
**Category:** Islamic Jurisprudence

The speaker argues that the obligation to establish an Islamic system of governance arises only when Muslims have sufficient power and authority. He highlights the key components of establishing an Islamic state, which include prayer, zakat collection, commanding good and forbidding evil, and a just judiciary. He states that Muslims are obligated to establish Islamic rule if they possess the power to do so, as they are not allowed to be ruled by non-Muslims under these circumstances. 

## It would be uh, what is it exactly that is forbidden? Establishing an Imam in different areas uh, is of course a forbidden thing, the Prophet Sallallahu wa sallam said whoever dies without having pledged an allegiance to an Imam, he will die in a state of Jahilliyyah. 
**Category:** Islamic Jurisprudence

The speaker clarifies that while it is forbidden to promote anarchy or rebel against legitimate authority, there is a distinction between establishing order through multiple Imams and having a singular, global leadership for all Muslims. He stresses the importance of working towards unity and realizing that unity in a way that is feasible considering the sociopolitical realities of different times. 

## He does comment on this uh, because obviously I've done a bit of check on it, he does mention this uh, again tying back into the issue of uh, Imam, having an Imam in complete Anarchy. 
**Category:** Islamic Jurisprudence

The speaker acknowledges that scholars often use quotations from the Prophet and other prominent figures to support the notion of a khilafah. He cites examples of scholars who affirm the importance and necessity of establishing an Imam to defend the weak, protect borders, and enforce law and order. However, he stresses that these quotations are not about a single, global Imam, but rather the need for leadership within any Islamic entity.

## Here's what happens when you always happens, they have effs, so, but it does not um, I uh, said in the beginning that we have to separate between Imam or im, as an order versus anarchy, versus having one IM for the entire um, these are two different discussions. 
**Category:** Islamic Jurisprudence

The speaker reiterates that the need for multiple Imams within an Islamic entity is distinct from the concept of a single global Imam. He highlights the importance of understanding these two concepts separately. While the need for an Imam to enforce order is a certainty, the idea of a single, global Imam is a different discussion. 

## That that that that entity, let's say, the Medina, the Medina State, the Medina established by med constitution, emerged by natural phenomena in the universe, the Jews come negotiate about what happened to the, he wed War. So we we took Liberty to to eliminate him because he's a warrior and Warrior who's aggressive and rallying people against us while hiding in his in fortification, we all that his assassination that's perfectly legitimate, that's that's that's clear. 
**Category:** Islamic History

The speaker provides a historical example of how the khilafah in Medina emerged organically. He describes the interaction between the Prophet and Jewish leaders, the establishment of the Medina constitution, and the subsequent assassination of a Jewish leader who posed a threat.  He emphasizes that the assassination was justified due to the leader's aggressive behavior and threat to the community. 

##  That's that's how it emerged emerged naturally, so it happens naturally. So the question is: is it an obligation? Obligation does not make any sense if a state like that emerges naturally. 
**Category:** Islamic Jurisprudence

The speaker emphasizes that the need for an Islamic state should not be viewed as an obligation in the same way that the Prophet's da'wah was not an obligation before its natural emergence. He argues that the emergence of an Islamic state is a natural consequence of the strength and authority of the Muslim community, not a predetermined mandate. 

## So without the, the Deen can be established, one of his sweeping arguments that the whole Junction of, has come to establish, bring and prevent, no it's not true, it it does that, but it is not established for that, established to establish, that's that's that's that's the creation of man and Jin is to to acknowledge Allah as the ultimate Supreme Lord, and submit to him, that's I think the fact that they they framed The Prophet's Mission as being to establish uh, Islamic Authority, in retrospect makes all this, you know, this entire perspective, the whole thing is being misunderstood, following and you get nowhere and then you find some a good man like, like no who issh with a simple-minded man, making such formulation and so on.
**Category:** Islamic Theology

The speaker refutes the claim that the Prophet's mission was solely about establishing Islamic authority. He argues that the purpose of creation is to acknowledge and submit to Allah, and that framing the Prophet's mission as an attempt to establish a khilafah leads to a misunderstanding of his true purpose.  

## He does make a point about the Anarchy. So I'll just continue playing in me, be clear with you here, I would not have any faith crisis if we never had a khilafah until the day of judgment, it would not cause me any faith crisis, it would not cause me any like discomfort about my faith. There is a particular Hadith that people quote often, I grew up quoting this Hadith, I grew up believing in this wholeheartedly that, known, reported from which conveyed from the Prophet, that he said, so the Prophet said that you would have the Prophet among you for as long as Allah wills, and Allah will then raise it, or remove it when he wills, and then there will be a uh, on the prophetic method, for as long as Allah wills, and then Allah would raise it when he wills, and then there would be kingship, a reign of oppressive kingship, for as long as Allah wills, and Allah will raise it, and then there will be a reign of compulsive kingship, and then and then there will be then there will be on the prophetic me, on the prophetic mage, we were certain, and that is basically the problem of uh, the problem of lack of knowledge, uh, we were certain that this meant that we are waiting for a uh, on the prophetic method. Growing up I was like, when I was 17, I had given my first Jihad, when I was 17, and it was about that, was your first yes, that like overconfidence, that I have regretted afterwards, but anyway, uh, so so I was certain that this is this would be this is we were expecting this, and it would have caused any fifth crisis, then uh, to have been told that that no, this may never uh, materialize you know, a singular Global Leadership, political leadership for all Muslims may never materialize, uh, because uh, this Hadith meant to me, and and other and end times Hadith or Traditions meant to me that this is what we're waiting for, and we were also certain that Muhammad would not be the first khilafah, sometimes we thought that it may be, sometimes we thought that then we came to learn that no, it's likely not, he's not going to be the first Khalifa, and uh, our understanding of the end of times uh, Traditions also was was pretty uh, strict, and uh, to a great deal literalist, and I am a scripturalist you know, so some people that would be unkind to me would say literalist, but I believe I'm a scripturalist, uh, so I don't be the importance of of those reports, but I have like a little bit more flexible understanding of them that is not saying metaphorical, but I am someone who subscribes to contextual language Theory, um, and I I have a little bit more flexible understanding of those reports. Now, this particular Hadith, this particular Hadith, this is how I would look at this particular Hadith, that that would be basically uh, presented to Muslim youth to tell them that you must believe in this uh, as you believe in, you know, Allah being uh, for instance, above his throne, or you must believe in this as you believe in the day of judgment being true, um, you know, and uh, and the angels, and and and all of that stuff, I don't believe so anymore for several reasons, one of them to begin with being a scripturalist, uh, I believe in what said that which means that the rank of the Sunnah is subsequent to the Quran, is not equal to the Quran, it's subsequent to the Quran, in consideration, is speculative mostly speculative, and certainty is with the Quran, not the this is the default, but certainty is not with the Sunnah, sh himself says that certainty applies to the Sunnah, to the collective body of the Sunnah, not individual Hadith, not individual Hadi, so you may say that you belong to tradition and I do, um, that does not mean at all that we don't have basically the concept of texal textual critique, or the the concept of critiquing the M of the Hadith, not only the Quran, so we recognize that the you know, is needs to be critiqued, but the M also needs to be CRI, there is there is a particular book by which would translate to the lofty Lighthouse concerning the authentic and the weak in in which he says that uh, there is a report from the prophet Sallallahu alaihi wasallam, uh, you know, in which the prophet was reported to have said, reported to have said, so when a man sneezes while in conversation, it's a sign on his truthfulness. So says despite the fact that some have authenticated the chain of narration, this, the the observable reality contradicts the Hadith, the observable reality contradicts the Hadi, it's a very sensitive topic of course, we this this quotation, uh, it causes consternation amongst many who don't even know this is from our own many even the the notion of using and common sense to look at an is and mentions this for multiple examples, is not the only one, that when something is observably patently false, right, and if you find some solitary chain that even if some people might think that the chain is authentic, observed reality is going to be more important than a v chain right, and this is something that again I also brought up a number of my lectures with regards especially eschatology because this is another issue I wanted to mention and that is, it's understandable that especially at a young age, we all went through that eschatology, and and and uh, um, signs, the day of judgment, they they they occupy or preoccupy a type of obsession that actually perhaps even is not as useful as other sciences, and disciplines, and we've all, sorry I thought I just interrupt there, um, so so this this is the, I I put this in because this is a pretty good discussion around the is, this the the issue of Quran and Sunnah, is definitely we discussed the book of we refer to it, definitely Sunnah is lower than the Quran with certitude, the Sunnah as such, if you are present with the messenger of Allah, and you're hearing it directly, is as if you are hearing the Quran in matter of reliability, no doubt about that, last number, that's the issue number one, now the Quran is is transmitted to us letter by letter in writing, and by the way let me stress what we said in at the beginning, that the Quran, the Quran Revelation, is is is being read, and the first the M who was shown A parchment and J asked him read, say I'm not reader, I'm litered, I can't read, so it was in a parchment, it is written, it's a written Revelation, some people say okay, if it's written Revelation, maybe the sahaba wrote, I I argue that even the writing of the Quran dictated them how to do, and order them to remove for example, the dot on the top of, and and without dots, leave it like that, so this is by by divine order, and this is clearly also in the Quran, direct, it's in a protected tablet, some people say that things written before the creation, this is Imagination Running wide, it's not that, it's something else, but this clear, it's written, and written and Transit written and transmitted, also in pronunciation, that's no doubt, so it was certitude about transmission, and also now certified by by carbon dating for the doubter in the west, it's finished, that's gone, we don't need to discuss that, it's just we just we have just to prove is it from divine origin, or from Muhammad's Invasion, that's all point to remaining to be discussed, B on internal and external evidence, for Muslims, I believe it's well established with by necessity of reason, that is from a divine origin, cannot be from Muhammad nor can it be from the Arabs, nor from a community in the time, nor nor from the Devil, it has be has to be done as it claims about from Allah, that's fine. Theah, is by itself definitely, that's the utterances and and the action of the Prophet and his approval because he unable as we argued in the book of know that, but problem is Sunnah is not is not protected in its totality, protected in the sense, because it's part of the the you could read the Quran will be nice, no many people think Quran is wrong in the Quran, if in the case of Revelation means both Quran and Sunnah, is also and we have proven that with certitude, in the protection of the Quran, we know how it is protected, being written and the Quran say the tablet, so that makes the certitude it is a revelation in writing, the Sunnah is not like that, it's nature and it's narrated, and you plenty of it is written at the time, plenty of it definitely you have EST that, and in private collection, so a private collection is not like a public book like the Quran because a public book is all impossible to to to to misprint or falsify, or anything like that, but but a private, private notes, come CH, that one who wrote the note, me later change it, or was it like that, or did they make a mistake, or he cannot read a certain word, and corrected, and so on, and turned out to be false, that's not possible in the Quran, it's possible in the Sunnah, so the Sunnah is narrated, a private collections of writing, and pure oral translation, but actually it's mostly private notes, this by its own nature, can cannot what, the meaning that is protected, the only meaning that is possible is protected, Accord to its nature which meaning the totality of the sun is protected in the sense, that no false can encro, until which we cannot find out, that is fabricated, and no correct which we need in there are which don't need any that, that that one day saw a type of dat is a very nice type and P, it we don't need that, it's not part of it's his personal preference, he like that of, doesn't anything depend about that, that can be many of the things definitely have been lost, many of it has been lost, what's we need in Deen meaning, in in what we do, what's legitimate to do or obligation, desirable, permissible, undesirable, and Haram, definitely not and also matter of and and perception, and belief, nothing can be lost, single Hadith may be questionable, secondly if it's the question was the really the there's a problem in that sense you exct the the meaning properly, then you canot conclude, assume you expected it properly fine is no is like the Quran, but this is very few and very rare, very few and so single Hadith, one mistakes of the said, is that the correctness of the is theoretically indicate that the M is correct is not, because the correct of the is is not establish with absolute certitude for one single isnat, it can't be one single isnat cannot be, because one witness can make a mistake, can confus, can get that we know that by necessary, so that even if it is connected, and if the whole chain say, and really connected and many of the shes in the books they are we assume they are connect because and could be connected and not connect, usually it's assumed to be connected and this is reasonable, but not necessary, so that's that's another point, so if you want to invoke a Hadith, you have to collect all the channels of narration, to various sah, or the same sahabi, to see what what was the original wedding, that's number one, because the wedding could could differ from one to another, it's a is a major mistake to to on only one, for example he mentioned about then will be with you until Allah decide to lift it up, then there will be, and then there will be there will be a kingship, made difference between oppressive and compulsive, in reality this is a mistake, that Hadi is not correct, the correct one is that will be will be will be, after that King, kingship which is biting which is op Ive and Kings will be Tyrant and will be shedding blood, and so on, so on, it's the same level, there's no two levels, there's let say there's a fabricated clearly fabricated which say there will be, this one which is for example, the darling of, claim this applies to Mu, is not true, there's none there, that's is the fabricated one, this this this chain container fabricator, there, so the correct is that uh, than then kingship which is oppressive and tyranical Etc ET no, and they may be called nominal, meaning head of state, after the Prophet, just nomin but they are not leg khilafah, and is only one chel of narration and said one, the one who narrated that I wrot with that, who people regard him as becoming almost like khilafah Rashid and he was very pleased to see this Hadith, this man maybe the one who wrote, I'm not saying he's fabricated it, maybe he he someone not a reliable one, and maybe this man meant maybe later on they will be a or later on will come back that's what he meant, but he thought it's appli to for example, so even application to whom it applies is unknown, besides I think it's only one channel saying then he remain silent of that, didn't say anything, so the I'm saying even that one has to be roniz study again, we doing that study now, some people are working on it, all possible channels, East and West, collecting all of them, that's number one, secondly if it refers to the Future, it is dangerous to get in in indulg in eschatology, because many of these things are based on imagination, people wishful thinking, that the Mahi will come, and in the operation people thinking that, people thinking this, people fabricating, people imagining, people having a sleep, and dreaming something, and think they have seen it, a reality, all of these things are there and have to be avoided, so that's number one general rule about, so that that's one, so we have to be very careful even, we have toiz, again, because I starting to have some doubt in certain issue there, but but it it may be valid because it can be given a good meaning, as I explained, which is enforced by another Hadith, which show that leaving the community is breaking the that's breaking the and so on, so I mean both of you did coincide with the fact that it's it's relation to being not being an anarchic type of situation, and it doesn't necessarily mandate having a khilafah per se, it's just in in his in his his existence, um, there's another section, so this is this is from um, so I've skipped ahead somewhat because it was a very good discussion on the MU scrutiny etc etc, it's good to good to see you know, it articulated by these these these Noble sh. Um, so this next B, he's he will discuss, no's um statement about on being a, because it ties into what I says and is also a bit of Mor which I know you have an opinion on, as well, so I think it's a good moment to also interject, many levels, I'm sympathetic but I wanted to quote you quotations that are well known in our tradition and I will quote very quickly, but it needs to be quoted because these are quotations always found in these discourses online, so for example, the says that the Muslims have to elect, or put up a leader, and of course says in that there is no difference of opinion, even in the entire, except for the, and then he made a pun because means the one that is deaf, and so he said, he was deaf or mute from the, so there is no uh, that there must be that is established, and says in his famous book that, and then he goes on, and another this translat as it must be known that the, that the leadership for the Affairs of the Muslims is the greatest of of this religion, rather the religion cannot be established except through it, and that is because the, or the necessary requirements of good of the children of Adam, will never take place unless they come together and help one another, and when they do so, there must be a leader amongst them, like the Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wasallam said, if three people go on traveling, then one of them should be in charge, and let me quot one or two more because again, these are the quotations we given, says that all of them have agreed that it is W to have an Imam, and that it is obligatory upon the um to then submit to a just Imam, and then of course you have, and I'll finish here, and I have other coures, I have a whole bunch of quotations, because again this is the whole point, anytime you start about this, you're immediately bombarded with these quotations, so let us discuss them of course, is one of the few people has written the treaties on Islamic political science, we wish more had been written, but as you're aware, this is a topic that is not elaborated on, it can maybe discuss this later on in this in this podcast. 

## Says that the is a basic continuation in translating by by meaning of the, that the Prophet established and it is a protection of the deen, and it is the politics of this world, it is how we run this world, and to establish it for those who are going to be sufficient for it, it is W for by of the scholars, I can go on, and as you're aware, there's so many quations so one could say, so he does comment on this uh, I because obviously I've done a bit of check on it, he does mention this uh, again tying back into the issue of uh, Imam, having an Imam in complete Anarchy. Um, I mean if if you want I can continue playing it, and then you can comment at the end of it, or yeah, okay, so I mean because yeah, let's just let's just crack on with it. Your sentiment at the beginning, 5 minutes ago, seems to clash with all of these quotations. What would you respond to this? 
**Category:** Islamic Jurisprudence

The speaker highlights that scholars often use a variety of quotations to argue for the necessity of having an Imam, citing the consensus of scholars that it is Wajib to have an Imam and that the Ummah is obligated to submit to a just Imam. He emphasizes that the Khilafah is a continuation of the Prophet's legacy and a means to establish the Deen and govern the affairs of the world. 

## What would you respond to this? Here's what happens when you always happens, they have effs so, but it does not um, I uh, said in the beginning that we have to separate between Imam, or im, as an order versus anarchy, versus having one IM for the entire um, these are two different discussions. So, his book points out that difference, that one is, and one is not. One is a certainty which is the importance of installing an IM, or appointing an Imam basically to defend the weak, to protect the borders, to establish uh, Law and Order, there is no question about this whatsoever, this is now plurality of IMS, multip of IMS versus Singularity uh, that is a different discussion, realistically speaking, we have one IM for a very short period of time and thereafter we have not been uh, all under one IM for the vast majority of our history, but theologically speaking, you know speaking from the F Viewpoint, uh, the first one is a matter of consensus, the second one, you know, can we have several imams, several khalifas, if you use the word khilafah in its linguistic sense, which appears to be how the sah viewed it, himself, said if you say, and then said to him, he said okay, that works, so said if if you say the successor of the successor of the messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr was the successor of the messenger, if you say the successor of the successor of the messenger of Allah, this will be long, then said to him, and in other reports, others that we are the Believers, you are our leader, Prince Amir um, so you are the leader of the Believers, you are Amir, I think some of this is being covered already, I mean, so he frames it in from the point of view of um, I first, the issue of that is one one entity which has a head alone, we we we we finish that before that, when we discuss the Hadith about, in in our research, that's that's gone, that's any claim otherwise, against that it's just nonsensical, I mean, in his framing, he's for example, saying having multiplicity of IMS, your your work on Hijra and citizenship already covers that, you both conclusion, leave the word IM multiplicity of Islamic entities, which each one is an independent state, and an entity of the international law in that sense, an independent international law like Muslim, so so this framing for example, Imam noi saying about no, etc etc, I mean what what about what, well that's no, we said about having an IM, and let me just go back to the to the actual wording, don't worry anyone, we have the clear that there could be several entities now, in every entities the ruling of Islam applies, the question now, an entity has to be run, if they are believers, and the majority of the power is in the hand of the Believers, otherwise, it's not an Islamic, it's something else, we not discussing that, if it's an entity, Islamic entity, and the people are doing their Duty, and do not don't allow to be rud with that, Allah does not reveal, the question is: is it possible, conceivable, in the real universe that a community of people, even a village, can be run without a head, all history has shown that you have to have a head, that's a necessity dictated by by the real situation in the universe, like said and it is it's not possible, really to to to have a such entity without a head, betting disputes, because dispute will happen in human interaction, humans are fallible and they have interaction, and someone will transgress, and someone mistakes, and then there will be disputes, and who settled the dispute will be the Judiciary belonging to a certain Imam, and also protecting the weak from the strong, because the strong, T, we cannot be assume that everyone, if the people are will WR us and P us like Angels, you don't need the management of the affair of the common Affairs, should be done by, but despite the sh, you cannot have sh in every in every single point, and every moment, so you'll have to have people who do there some executive, and other adopting laws, and things like that, that's how States emerged, that's the reality of the universe, since it is the reality, and no peace and Tranquility can be established, and ruling without cannot be done without having a structure of the state, with a head of state, or a prime minister, or or power distributed between certain entities, that that that state structure must be established, so that ruling with that has revealed, is established, how it is exactly, is it one Imam, or two, one one IM, and Deputy IM, or the im a council of imams, and they vote, and then, if the equal votes, the the the head gives the balancing vote, all of that will be is procedures to be settled by a constitution, so they're confusing two things, that people in human Community could not be established, could not live in peace, and the just, and the ruling with that Allah has revealed, and establishing that, collecting zakat for example, all of these things could not be established permanently, and well in a continuous proper way, except by having a state structure, by having a leadership, and it has to be in the cas of Islamic, Islamic entity, has to be by by Shah based on Shah, which obviously the technicality of election and B and things like, have to be structured in, if that's the meaning, yes, in that case, an IM let's say im is just a metaphor for the state, IM is just a state essentially, it could be one single person, could be a complicated structure, could be like a head of state, Council of ministers and the head, the and the Prime Minister, different than the head of state, or equal to the head of State, and then we have different chambers of Parliament, and we have a supreme court, and other courts, that's the IM, is totally as entity, but some structure must be there, because it it has been proven, since maybe the time of Hunter gather, is not possible without having a leader of the group, and clear, that even if people are having a casual togetherness, along the a because said the traveler alone is a shan, is a devil, the two Travelers are a devil, three are a caravan or or Travel Group, and if you are three and more, you must appoint one to be the leader, question is this is this by rational principles, for if you in TR, you have to in any life situation, you need any any three ABS need need need one to lead and dispute, and organize, what to do, what to do next.

The speaker emphasizes that the need for an Imam is rooted in the practicalities of human nature and the necessity of having order within any community, regardless of size.  He explains that the presence of an Imam is not a theological mandate, but rather a practical necessity that has been evident throughout history.

##  What did the second verse say about women? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker points out that the second verse refers to women from among the listener's own community, and specifies married women. This means that the verse is exclusively talking about married women who are committing adultery or other sexual misconduct. 
## What does it mean both who are committing it?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker discusses the interpretation of the phrase "both who are committing it," which refers to adultery and fornication.  One interpretation is that it refers to women who are not in wedlock and men who are, and the other is that it refers to both parties who are committing adultery within the context of marriage.  The speaker suggests that the latter interpretation is more widely accepted, and that the misconduct referenced is the same as that discussed in the previous verse.
## How did abrogation develop and how does it work? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker explains that abrogation occurs when a later verse supersedes an earlier one, making the earlier verse no longer applicable.  This process is often hinted at in the Quran through wording such as "Allah has made a way out" or "take from me this ruling." The speaker provides an example of abrogation with the imprisonment of married women for adultery, which was later replaced by a new ruling.
## Why is this an unsafe claim?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker argues that the claim that the imprisonment of married women for adultery was abrogated by stoning is unsafe because the Quran states that if a verse is removed, it will be replaced by a similar or better one. Since stoning is not mentioned in the Quran, it seems unlikely that it completely abrogated an earlier verse.
## What is the most important thing to remember about abrogation? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker stresses that only another verse can abrogate a verse in the Quran. He also emphasizes that abrogation is a complete removal, not just a restriction or clarification of the general meaning.
## What is the story of the two Jews? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker tells the story of two Jews who saw a man and a woman being punished for adultery. They confirmed with the Torah that stoning was indeed a punishment for adultery. This story is presented as evidence that stoning was a punishment for adultery in the Torah. 
## What is the significance of the story of the two Jews?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker explains that the story of the two Jews highlights the fact that the Prophet Muhammad used the Torah as a tool to demonstrate that his law, in this case, stoning, is in accordance with the previous revelation. By forcing them to admit that their law was the same as his, he established his authority as an independent messenger. 
## What did the Prophet Muhammad say about stoning?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker highlights that the Prophet Muhammad stated that stoning was a practice that had been abrogated from the Quran. This statement is significant because it undermines the argument that stoning was a valid punishment under Islamic law. 
## Why is the issue of stoning so important? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker explains that the issue of stoning is crucial because it highlights the ongoing debate among Islamic scholars regarding abrogation. Some argue that stoning is still applicable, while others believe it was abrogated. This debate is important because it has significant implications for the application of Islamic law in modern times.
## What is the best way to understand the issue of stoning?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker argues that the most straightforward approach is to acknowledge that the verse about imprisoning women for adultery was abrogated. Since stoning is not mentioned in the Quran, it is likely that the punishment for adultery is now limited to flogging. 
## How does repentance relate to ignorance?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

##  What is the importance of repenting before death?

## Why is repentance not accepted from those who die as kufar?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker states that repentance is not accepted from those who die denying God's existence. This is because those who die as kufar have chosen to reject God's guidance and will therefore face a painful punishment.
## What are the limitations of repentance? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker mentions that there are certain signs that indicate that the door of repentance has been closed.

The speaker emphasizes that people should not wait for these signs but should embrace faith and do good deeds before it is too late.
## How does the Quran address the issue of inheriting women against their will?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

This verse emphasizes the importance of treating wives with fairness and kindness.

**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

This verse emphasizes the importance of mutual respect and consent in marriage. It emphasizes that men should consult with their wives and try to resolve any disagreements in a good manner.

## Why is it forbidden to marry a woman whom your father previously married? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

This verse prohibits men from marrying their father's wives. This prohibition is rooted in the idea that such a marriage would be considered a shameful and evil act. The speaker also clarifies that the prohibition applies even if the father has passed away.
## What are the consequences of violating this prohibition?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker states that violating the prohibition against marrying one's father's wife is considered an act of war against the Islamic system. The consequences for this violation are severe, including the death penalty and confiscation of property.
## What is the difference between Zina and a public offense?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker distinguishes between zina, which is a sexual act committed in secret, and a public offense, such as marrying a prohibited woman. Zina is considered a sin with its own punishment, while a public offense is seen as a direct challenge to the Islamic system and therefore merits harsher consequences.
## Does a private act of marriage with a prohibited woman constitute a public offense?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker clarifies that even a private marriage with a prohibited woman is still considered a public offense and warrants severe consequences. This emphasizes the importance of upholding the rules and regulations established by Islamic law.
## How does this verse clarify the concept of fostering? 
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker clarifies that fostering, in the context of this verse, refers to being raised in the same household as a woman.  This means that a man cannot marry a woman who was raised in his household, even if he did not directly foster her. 
##  Does fostering require a specific duration?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker emphasizes that there is no specific time frame for fostering that would make a woman prohibited.  Any time spent being raised in the same household as a man, regardless of duration, would make her prohibited to him. 
## What are the implications of this verse for the concept of adoption?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker explains that the verse about fostering is relevant to the issue of adoption because adoption has been abolished in Islam. This means that a foster child is not considered a son or daughter and does not inherit the same restrictions as a biological child. 
## How does the verse clarify the prohibition against marrying the wives of one's sons?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker explains that the verse prohibits marrying the wife of a son who has been born from the man's own loins.  This prohibition extends even to daughters-in-law with whom the man has not consummated the marriage.
## What is the significance of the prohibition against marrying two sisters simultaneously?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

The speaker states that this prohibition is designed to prevent rivalry and conflict between two women who are closely related.  It is considered inappropriate and harmful to have two women who are sisters or aunts in the same household. 
## What is the implication of this verse for the concept of marrying a deceased wife's sister?
**Category:**  Quran Interpretation

## The Speaker discusses how understanding of the Quran's language is essential for its interpretation.

**Question: "the section where he talks about uh the understanding at the time of the it was centered around the language of the people at that time yeah" (19.48s) **
Category: Linguistics

**Answer:** The Speaker mentions that the understanding of the Quran in its time centered around the language of the people then, Arabic. He clarifies that the language was fully recorded and preserved beyond the initial two generations.

**Question: "the he say it's it seemed to tie in with you know the first two generations so about self understanding there's a fallacy the language of the at that time but this language is fully recorded it's more than two two generation fully recorded as a language and that's all that's needed so if you say the the studing of Sal is a mistake if say the language of Sal yes so there there is there is a with words here because he won't say we understand Quran andah with the how the understood it no with the Arabic language in some places the did not understand properly let let me expound on that it may belong to the end but should we keep it to the end let me continue so we can cut it and separate it if needed the first of all the the language is sufficient by itself as the people speak it has nothing to do with Sal and believer nonbeliever other thean would not how they don't ponder about the Quran if it happens to someone else beside Allah they will find contradiction it that's address it to they don't believe in Sal there was no at that time they don't even believe in Muhammad tell them okay you are Arabs Quran is in Arabic read it and see find contradiction so read it on the language level as a language as a text as a literary piece read the literary piece and see what's it could be this literary piece being produced by Muhammad or by the Arabs or by yourself or by some sual being maybe the devil maybe analyze all of these possibilities for that you need to know the language and the Medina and mea they are Arab genuine Arabs they definitely genuine Arabs and if one is by by accident not the genuine Arab like a slave or something that then he can ask Arab friends and them until he analyze the meaning completely he know some good part of the meaning but not the full nuances of the meaning" (30.039s) **
Category: Linguistics & Interpretation**

**Answer:** The speaker clarifies that the Arabic language used in the Quran was fully recorded, and therefore, the understanding of the language is paramount to comprehending the Quran. He emphasizes that Sal (a supposed linguistic influence on the Quran) isn’t relevant for interpretation.  He urges listeners to study the Quran as a literary piece, analyzing its language to assess its origin and authenticity. He explains that even non-Arab speakers can consult with Arab friends to fully grasp the nuances of the Quran's meaning. 

**Question: "secondly we have narration that some words in the Quran some some were not known to some of the sah even the biggest like Abbas Abbas explained that the Quran is dominant over and controlling over the previous scripture and they say Shah use the word witness Shah but we we dug in the book of that's in the book of we dug deer and we found that of poetry about that time in a complet independent issue not explain the Quran in which m means dominant on controlling holding someone from the neck dominant so even AB being AI being eloquent missed one word so what do you mean even even in the linguistical way he because m is very rare extremely we find only one poetry from someone in that's it which show that the meaning is this one not Shah it's definitely Shah but Shah in other situation controlling which has two meanings obviously in matter of of of ruling an injunction M mean it's it can abrogate dominate it can abrogate in matter of reports and so on it corrects hey no this is wrong that's not correct that's good this is the one you have to adopt the other one must be fabrication or falsification or something lost and so on that's for Scholars to find what are the reason for this different but the Quran tell you clearly for that you need only the linguistic aspect" (155.8s) **
Category: Linguistics & Interpretation**

**Answer:** The speaker explains that some words in the Quran were not known even to some of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, like Abbas. This highlights the Quran's dominance over previous scriptures and the importance of understanding the Quran's unique linguistic nuances.  He cites an example of a word, "m,"  which is rare in Arabic and its meaning in context. The speaker concludes that understanding the linguistic aspects of the Quran is crucial for accurate interpretation.

**Question: "thirdly the people after taking the witness that he completed the Miss may Allah have Mery or may beautify the faith of anyone who memorized my my speech and report it as he memorized it because someone who receives May understand better than someone who reports are essentially reporter some of the Next Generation May understand better May comprehend things better or may not so all of this no agree agree they don't have another language it's exactly the Arabic and the Arabic essentially in most eloquent is the form the and but also the Arabs of n for example the the high level of n that's in in in east of and before like and so who they first CL first class eloquent the other tribes like are not to that level they would were not taking language on them the only plus qur and and there other tries and so but they are secondary so up to that level of distillation they were using so that's what we are dealing with is we are dealing with Arabic language in the time of Revelation which is the same persistently until the time of and persistently until the time of the next Generation Next Century third Century recording of of the dictionaries and the meaning of the things okay that's it and you remember sometimes I commented on the word that original meaning is is sincerity and really good faith sincerity not what people say advice advice is Quran advice them but because advice is theoretic and by in should be sincere should not make except out of sincere of sincerity for for his best the best for him not for the best for you the best for him and as good as you can in in finding the meaning of Shar and so on so but then somehow the word was was limited to the sermons in the in the Masid and things like that and from people who they call people of religion and so on and while advising anybody like advising was called because the people offering initially off say I have a I have a sincere advice to you and the word took over slowly so until now if you had anyone mean usually meaning advice and like a written document of advice not sincerity and good faith that's one another one which we have detected also I mentioned it sever time the Divine name come from means the complete capacity of mind it's better than the word so is the one who perfectly rational but the scholars do not like use it for Allah because is usually connect things together and the Divine knowledge is based on spontaneous seeing the reality as it is so it's not connecting things together in that some sense or another so they don't like talking about Allah alth some use that some that but Alim is not the one who forbearing you insult and hurt and he does not take revenge immediately that's that's one characteristic of someone who's fully IR rational then the specific characteristics how to behave in the case of has overshadowed the original General meaning that's another example that's in general usage in these two terms in some areas of the of the of the Muslim World Arab world some have taken out out of because of sat repeating of prayers and so on took that different meaning for example if you meet someone from Morocco don't wish him AIA he will become angry AIA saving being saved being protected what's the reason the word AIA in in Mor in the far west is used for the fire because every time the h fire is mentioned time may Allah protect us we ask for divine protection until it came in people mind fire is protection protection fire so the right protection became enous for fire that's how it developed these guys will go to the the mind now if you say I wish you become angry meaning I wish you to go to the hell for or if you visit some of the hospital beware that it goes the healing not yeah so that claim is is is a misn and the dangerous way to go meaning the way they understood is a binding one it is the Sue one besid it's contradict a very important aspect of the Quran that the Quran is having NeverEnding amazement like says how come you get more amazement by finding more deeper meaning and layers of meaning so the generation of the did not understand many things in certain areas we understand more than them I gave an example last time or time before last about the only they know is this this this creature which is usually in in hot countries and swamps and so on which she stuck to your skin it's like a worm will suck your blood and you can pull it away H leech leech leech and the only way to pull it out safely is to have some fire or something and touch it so it pulls his needle out and then you can throw it away if you pull it like that you have a severe injury that's what they but what the come from what something which Lees something sticks something clings and that's found by whom and by whom correctly to be the egg the human egg is okay it has to wait almost 120000 years because that's all what and they see the mation blood oh this maybe the is going down that's all what they know medically so the amazement of Quran came clearly in the 20th century and who find it a fren man it's okay perfectly fine no problem completely no problem amazing never ends so Thea I don't me that is not we have in several issues clearly at fault I don't think so can compete in my being a Sal and being ancient with and he did he did not know what to do with Kal we discussed that in the one who dies without offsprings or parents and grandparents Etc so only have ha who are surrounding nothing down and nothing up like the com from is that that with a Roman foot made out of what's the name of that tree or that leaves around it smells good wreath they call it wreath what's the name of the the plant is well known in Arabic it's a good smelling one it's well known anyway if you ask anyone show him there a picture of a Roman with this around his head this is made of this plant it's used as spice also because it's around the head clean around so nothing in the top nothing in the bottom the top is parents and grandparents the bottom is children and of grandchildren that's kalala linguistically Omar was never able to understand the ruling of kalal he knows what's Kal in Arabic but he was never able to understand the AY of the Quran because have certain wrong premises to the level that he asked was the only one who could read and write said if you find relaxed and peaceful then ask him about what is so waited until sometime relax and and got to she said I didn't I would like to ask you so that I write it down say who told you to ask about that immediately detected the FL om she could not say no he said yes he will never understand it is it sufficient the AY in and the one at the end of the which came down in is not sufficient for him he will never understand and she told he he caught me red hand that I'm writing on your behalf and said of Allah is right I will never understand that it's a very simple issue while one one generation one Young when when he he the story told told the the the old T who reported that from Omar he he it from Omar say what's the problem with it's the one who has no no no no origin and no no no offsprings it's only what's wrong with that say they were doubting about the parents which is UT nonsense just read the AY it's clear like sun in the daylight so this is just playing games they want to remove them and go back to some some understanding of claim Superior because he's more anian no has nothing to do be more Asian nothing to do being a sahabi there are people after sah who understood certain is much better than S much much better much better issues not only words I mentioned the case of like for example and M and so on I barely found that that poetry in modern times when say about it's translated now withy of the Imperial powers and so on it is common nobody will have even an think one second it means anything we witness or no it is it is dominance it is hemony it's exactly hemony that's the translation in in in and Geo in in geopolitics and Geo geopolitical Sciences hegemonial powwers power who want to dominate Hony imperialism and so on Hony Western Hony being undermined Now by multipolar World Hony is and that's us now in the two last centuries extensively and nobody's that but it was a by AB so all of this is just is just just beating around the bush attempt to create aab which is no which is a phy besides of we have clear injunction in theith of in the long form of the had of who was asking about about fan and tribulation coming later time and and he said ask was asking about evil which will come in the future because I know the good he wrot the good I know what good and every time tell him that's the full narration in with it's not as good or better than b by the way and they have a sheet of that and even even tweeted it several times it ask him would be evil after this said why you asking avoid the learn the book of Allah and do do act accordingly three times then he tell him this will happen then he ask after that he say the book of what is need you come to me Arab Quran is Arab learn it and if a point or a construction is a bit difficult because not all the Quran is straightforward 99% is just even a common VI we now will understand plenty of it but there are some difficult passages some deep issues in some places in that case you go to other people who have scholar maybe a current scholar is more Superior than an ancient scholar you go to the book go to current scholar I would go for the word for example and the meaning something clings he scientist and heon that issue spent half of his lifeon that issue is superior to any sah that simple Le the book of Lear you learn you do the learning what tool you need for that a sound brain be unbiased withdraw yourself this the book of Allah it has Comm it will lead me I don't need it it lead me you don't find something you don't like I don't like that let me try to twist and find another meaning and find a that's the way of going downhill no let it lead you make yourself like a sheep which being pulled by by by a robe from the neck behind the shepherd just let the Quran lead you and a she knows how to deal with the Rob and how to follow to walk you know Arabic that's all what you need make the Quran your IM read it and if there something difficult there'll be difficulty for some people to have ask other people who have learned and third one a fourth one an ancient one a current one future one you canot because he's not yet here so you canot ask for the future and if you don't achieve anything satisfactory you say I don't know the meaning Allah Knows Best because we have now overwhelming evidence before that that's from Allah so Allah intended something maybe it's not clear for me at the moment maybe it's for the future it will come one day maybe it's for too dumb to understand not twisting so all of this all this this is this is nonsense just check it in the B with all respect to everyone nobody should be and this is is exactly what what what for examp sh sh is one of the follower middle follower he born 17 H his mother was one of the Sabi one of the SP war of Jala J was fought in 1617 so he's born immediately about a year after that so 178 and he died 104 105 and he was maybe his time's sup most Supreme memorizer and exactness and if someone ask him he for somehow he was regarding himself as narrator memorizer not someone who analyzed although he's shows in many occasion extreme intelligence and sophistication but he was too worried to give fatwa so someone ask him what is this say has this view previous generation him what's your point of view so what do you want with my point of view take my point of view and urinate over it that's and he's a second generation according to me from someone say refering to because he want to withdraw from the responsibility he did not trust himself to that to do that and maybe in that he is he is a bit sinful maybe he said no I will take the point Abbas I think he's more C to understand the Quran myself and he's more a better Arabic speaker than myself and he has lived with the prophet more than myself so his point of view isasia the better one and it's proven otherwise yeah so all of this is just just beating around the bush and refusing to go and and and find something which does not fit with your M and you are then in a conflict no you're not in a conflict you be in a conflict only if you think that this is the way to go no that's not the way to go the way to go is clear follow what has to you from your lord what has revealed is a script and in a language which is completely protected more protected almost protected like the Quran and more protected than the if that's not enough then there's a problem with you problem with you not with the text or not with the Arabic language and the problem could be a natural problem you don't have the sufficient to to to connect a deep problem sufficiently well or you are falling in one of the classical TRS of reading a scripture is that reading sentences and verses out of context not reading verses before and after until you comprehensively cover a complete content and then reading them alone without another one Rel to similar the same topic in another place until you comprehend all the Quran then you are in the safe ground to conclude something but this is because you're failing to do this static way not not cut cut the Quran into pieces take it a whole and not twisting things out of their context taking out of context part of twisting words out of their meaning so here the problem will come come really to the daylight if it was s out of their meaning that's the main one and then not addressing the all the eyes of the Quran related to that topic or or issues with connect with somehow putting all of them and synchronize them properly or find the contradiction so it's not from Allah that's the only way to go that's it not referring to Sal and that doesn't work it has not work you see most the references to Sala and so on is is end in in in in fallacies and and contradictions and we are willing everything they this said that and so person to show that is not a Sal it's or one of the of who are usually maybe good memorizer and good reporter and even they question mark about that but definitely not good thinker and anist they are shallow and surface and most of them they're Arabic is questionable anyway so so that that's that's that's the whole situation if you dig deeper you find say the Sal agreed on issue of and so on that no one guides himself orti fatalism no go see what report of there are most of them if weize the narration Chuck in the B everything anti fatalist but they made him fatalist obviously had fabricated a Hadith and broken Hadith and so on then you will end in utter confusion which ends nowhere for example in serious issue like like Destiny and fism and so let alone in issues anyway I think I red too much about that but what do you mean you mean the language as it was in the time of Quran that's resd completely reserved besid most of the Quran explain itself like the word vi is use in five six meanings I have that in the book of listing all of them and analyzing them" (1395.679s)

## 3807.96s :  In terms of the as is an anniversary the situation of the Arab lands uh Arab Thrones do you think it's becoming even more and more precarious what's oh this if any every the Victor comes all of these will lose the justification of the existence they will be exposed they will expose what they are filthy miserable evil criminals and agents of the of the Zionist of the West and all the past that they are working for the um and they want to revive it but they have to work slow they have to conclude the temporary peace all of this will be exposed because we know most of the regime not all of them most of the regime are just British and then American implants and they have they have even they don't have even the destiny in their hand look at Jordan for example some people say Jordan announced that they will participate in any American attack against Iran obviously they have to say that because American told them we are going to use your space you just say it's with your permission and your order or against your will say whatever you want and it's clearly that they canot say the American are forcing us we don't have any power then the people will know that this regime is just a shadow of itself and they will Rebel immediately so the best for them to gain some time and they think maybe they think we get a longer time but they don't think so because the wife of abdah for example is the country and they say she's selling jewelry and buying real estate in America so they they're buying some place that to live most likely so I advise him really package and go quickly I just let let that go to that that is they they are there for almost a c no more than a century I think Abdullah was implanted there yeah about 20 1924 25 yeah it's almost a century enough is enough just leave just leave and that's that's the one which is clearly exposed and everyone knows even Western anist say commenting on his statement in the United Nation we say will never accept that the palestin will be expelled to to Jordan say not to accept or reject is not in his power and everyone in the Arab world and also in the westernland no this is man the Arabs all agree that he's a traitor so he has no place in history not so clearly with Al and so but they will be clear bahini are very clear but it's is the tiny country not elevance it exist only because of Sai National Guard giving protection there and now they're demonstration ongoing there uh we'll see what the Iraqi government which is the puppet of the Americans is now in a in a very Troublesome situation if they move against the resistance front the people will slaughter them if they don't move the American pariz them I think they they would be this this one will collapse they be removed and the same apply for for Saudi Arabia andat on that subject the dogs of Al they're stoking up sectarian Rec rhetoric any any recommendations for us in the da sphere which is just just say okay okay you are the sun with come show us in the show what to do in the battlefield you have longer time than for example are in power longer than the Irani revolutionary fine you are long much longer power and you have much more oil and you have long time to develop your industry and your facilities where it is you had a longer time to to get ready to confront this F the brother of Muhammad is from another mother but they share the same father this said in a tweet a couple of years ago we have commenting on that that India is now become a major industrial power competing all coming close to to uh to to China uh he said we have missed 40 years in which we could have develop to our industrial power like India and China and he's right I responded to him with a nasty tweet but anyway that's the time to wish the content of that nasty response but they're admitting that they know that so where it is show correct a clearly you busy with something else not fighting for Islam not being Muslims not helping Muslim it's just oppos you're doing the opposite undermining getting getting Muslims everywhere if possible subdued and H you were with G against Sudan you fought against Al abdah and then with Al abdah against sometime with the some against the what do you want what do you think you are that's all I wouldn't I wouldn't involve very much if there is some maybe maybe we'll make a structural response to some of these people who are playing the secretan card to show more detailed aspect but for shabab I think just don't get to engaged I personally think I some of these maybe in a dedicated video and that's it okay but there is there is Merit in exposing for example so so basically it's it's politically charged because look look none of us agrees with what with what happened in Syria etc etc however this is a different scenario yeah yeah but we we we'll we'll get to that other we Arabic very very detailed response to that but maybe in the English domain we need some better maybe one video or something we okay I'll move to question answers this will we got a number that been submitted uh by message okay there's one this one that's been pending for a while this is on the subject of uh free mixing I mean you can probably dismiss this as you feel um there's a somebody just sent these evidence Abu da V4 Hadith number 5274 it is narrated upon the authority of Abu Ansari that he heard the messenger of Allah say when he saw people mixing together in the street oh men and women separate yourselves it is not allowed for you to be in the same place another one in Abu da it is rated from I Omar that he said the prophet prohibited men from walking between two women in abuth number 52 yeah it is narrated do not walk between women and third number four AB the prophet married me at seven and we had a relationship at 9ine and when I moved to Medina some women prepared me for the wedding and they they nor I never mixed with men in the in a in a house of women the women receiv received me and Men received the prophet and then we went to the house that's we we we we'll see all of these but the one who who brought is want to show that there evidences if he has theth with with their number and so on is he is he not able to give the isnad well he's just given this Hadith the the numbers Hadith without is is is just blah blah blah blah let him go and get the discuss it man by man I will show you where is the problem with all okay so so basically from your research from before it's about the you you I know all of these I know say but I'm not going to comment until he does some effort and get thatth with not okay this was submitted some time ago and it was just literally just a screenshot from Facebook so yeah doesn't doesn't work this way you have to do a little bit more work for that yeah thing is this is publicly accessible stuff so the finding the is isn't going to be besides this the translation where is the Arabic and in all Arabic there's no word mix or something like that the one with the street yes that's one uh I will tell you that that one now because I have done something in that a couple of years ago all others have very old hat anyway and weak isnad and broken and so on the one of the St is that the narration says that the messenger of Allah exiting for the Masid so women and men going along the street and he said addressing Roman is not for you to to be in the middle of the road go to the side of it it's some kind of traffic regulation but when we check the isad it is only one channel of narration to this sahabi and the one narrator or the one narrator from the alleged narrator is a man who is his is very interesting he he is a man who is obsessed with woman to such a level that he prayed to Allah that's the that's the story in and in the books of of men and their their certification he prayed to Allah to take his eyesight so he said he became blind so he's so extreme in that point that he blinded himself because we know that's this is this is the effect and then said then he said that blindness was too heavy for we pray to Allah to remove the blindness and became seeing again so if someone is like that in matter because because he don't want to see woman he's attracted to woman if someone is like that how which guarantee we have that this Hadith he he did not hear it from his she while awake maybe he so with in a vision or in a dream or he dreamed that he hear if someone is so obsessed that's a story in the book of and there's no other chel in the word this one that's an example the others even worse no that's no no the well established which are solid is that is being in seclusion this theith well established even the Hadith of travel we once discussed it casually I don't know in Arabic podcast the of no woman who believe in Allah should travel more than three days and a verion say two days it's the same story it's the one story it's a famous called and theth the full narration which clarify everything is that the messenger of Allah was talking in addressing and then he said addressing someone who a man obviously most likely a man so came home and found his wife with with one man from qur and then he felt a little bit strange and he mentioned that to Allah said your wife is a good woman this is what come in your mind is not correct but then he stood in the p and say no one should go to a woman who husband is not present except in the company of another man or two other men and then a man stood now story of the travel a man stood say Allah I have register myself in is famous mention the narator not remember the man he did not say this that most like and but my wife went into to to makah for or for for most or something like that so talking about seclusion so the man from this context if you read it carefully the man said my wife went and she went alone nobody with her and the travel to meccah will be several days it'll be overnight some part of it overnight she has to sleep the night in some side of the road but along the way there will be stretches and PES where she's alone and maybe one single man passing there would be a situation of almost certainly because this is the road of Haj there would be people going men and woman but it could happen and there reason we expect that uh that uh that uh that uh at night a man may be nearby at night is like a seclusion or a day she's resting to roadside and single man comes there and and settle next to her there will be a seclusion because nobody up to the Horizon there and there and this is seclusion seclusion is the place where you could have intercour with your wife essentially safely and this is in the open desert is possible if you look from the beginning of the road miles away and front nobody is there and such stes are easily available at the time so what to him go cancel your registration for the go and perform or with your wife that's the oration of Abbas Abbas was there he he it he was present he was sitting under the ppit and so on and this is the one which is was the source which people span various but this has to be studied obviously other our way of studying structure that's all that's there so even the travel and is not because of travel on and not even like IM Malik said because of security issues no it's because of is that's the only one that's the only one and many other things you find in barari no woman believe in there travel more than two days and one version of three days and shows the wavering show you that the narrator did not memorize properly they did something and did something like that that's only one this occasion only referring to that that story and it is related to seclusion that's the only thing anyway those are it's good if this person will will get us the the ask someone who knows Arabic to get to get the the the issue with with the the mar of and so on because this is Contra contradicting the later action of he they he asked and said they went to a wedding and say did you have some music or someone hting the drums and so on and it's known that in the wedding proc at the time men and women were mixing and they going and they call Za getting the the bride or the groom to usually the bride is there I don't know what happen in Medina because some countries the the the bride is is taken to the groom house and in N for example the groom is coming to the to the bride house and spending the first night at her father's house in hij the groom comes for the dinner and wait and pick her at the near dawn or late at night and take her to his home it depending but they come in in a group of people usually mixed and there's no Hadith which say Don't Go mixed or something like that that's encouraging to have drums and music and so on and he even mentioned some poetry of the an the love this PO poetry and so on that's in bukari so you have to scan all these Hadi you don't get couple of fa from Abu and ignore the other Hadith which is better in isad and better narrated and in other books ofth okay but this is just quick a quick something like that just mentioned Hadith without knowing the full wording all channels of narration how reliable the narration what's the problem of that Etc is is it only a single narration for this alleged occasion by the way it's well established that the messenger of Allah said once to to if we would separate men and woman in Doors door of the M because they were mixing at the door just because most likely men were more powerful and pushing woman aside that's the reason because Arab before Islam also be doings quite rough and not not polished not really that civilized whatever civilization mean and but he did not make another door was only one door and later in time of om when he extended the M he made the door dedicate for woman the door dedicated for men so time of Omar understood that would love to have the woman most obviously they were going at the same time and this men are almost like who were pushing woman and so on rushing out some people are rushing out for their work and business and things like that so this issue of and has has become like like a like a a nightmare haunting some people's brain because they have been conditioned over generation the same La what we we see that now happen in in Afghanistan with it became obsessive I mentioned that the source of obsession especially in I mentioned the famous laughable story of that 700 years ago I think this mentioned in the fwa fwa and so on I think or some other major book and that one she said the woman is that's obviously the word used in or for woman meaning shame or something which need to be covered or a private part and uh when she goes out this is this is narrat and some people some weak narrator lifted up to the prophet and if he goes out the devil is waiting okay and then the best for her and then the The Scholar said the best for her best cover for this is either husband or the grave and then one of the stud ask him she which is my the best cover of the two say the grave so this obsession is there and it fits the tribal mentality of Afghanistan and you see even what they call the scholar ABD who is like the Chief Justice there there there he has some tweets so he lived in the 21st century and he has tweets 50 tweets they they collected 52 they call Jewels or pears from these 50 or 40 something 25 about about three weeks so it's an obsession it's understandable some historical reasons some tribal origin some one some tribes are more than others in that area yeah that's that's that's well known but it does not make it Shar issue ald is well defined Quran first and and will establish especially in issues like that which obviously certain tribal background certain issues like that we have to be more scrutinizing than otherwise yeah we have to be more scrutinizing otherwise okay I've got a backlog of questions from somebody who's asked a while back okay one of them um just I'll just go through them very quickly Allah's messenger said God has 99 Names he hasn't given a reference 100 names less than one he said and he said he who will enter Paradise what's the meaning of if you're familiar the scholars are disputing that for hundred count them linguistically some people say just counting them is does not to make you really entitled for what meaning count them understand their meaning and act accordingly so then you get in the habit of make everything you do you look for Allah mercy and so that means you have fulfilled all IM it's it's it's one of the Hadith which is really interpretation and even the reliability is questionable all of that most likely it's something which is deliberately kept obscure so the people try to struggle with the meaning of definitely not just counting 1 2 3 4 5 that can't be the meaning by necessity of reason and Sh so understand them and respond accordingly so like if you if you it is one of the is is jaar the compell then you know that you are under Allah's absolute control and you have to submit and be humble Etc things like you have to be the opposite you have to be meek you have to be submissive to Allah because he's the compell canot be Jabar because for human being and for a created being jabarut is a negative for Allah it is positive things like that the response will be this and this and this and this yeah okay you want to say something um on the 99 Names of Allah even the Hadith that is in most of the book it just says for Allah there are 99 names and then it says but one of theth which then starts to say that is mud it's only a sub narrator who came up with those 99 names it's not the Hadith or the statement of wasallam so until this day we actually do not know all the N or nobody has actually compiled that in a way extracted from Quran and Sunnah because what they have done is some of the names that don't exist they have they've taken the F and from the action they have dered a name and Associated that to Allah and if we do that we come up from the Quran and Sunnah with like hundreds of names I strongly believe that's not the right approach because for example when Allah says he is they have to extract the name for that from the door file like and associated name to Allah and I think that's not right to extract Nam talk such a name like that is not good no yeah so for that reason the Hadith that mentions the names of Allah it's called mudra which is uh yeah it's the it's one of the sub narrator has attempted with all good intention to come up with the names and it's not the statement of wasallam and people make a mistake because half the Hadith isah the other half even I think it's IM th he at the botom he mentioned that this is um this is just a statement of a sub narrator and it's not found definitely there's no doubt that is M but to add that even that the Hadith is the body of the there's a question mark because we have the other Hadith which it's better establish every name of yours which you have read in your book or reserved it in in the in the hidden with you so they Divine names which is reserved for Allah the only one who knows them some them may be not knowable for any finite people so so this will be much more than 100 so there's a question mark about the whole Hadith anyway I I wouldn't get stuck with you have enough Divine names to the Quran just use them mention them make them for Dua like what the Quran says said Muhammad tell us he has only one God and he's supplicated to two Gods because he was saying in his Allah so he's supplicated to two de because of the with stupidity or just most likely just just just stubbornness but they should know that Allah has very Allah maybe they should I don't know maybe they so maybe like a solo like donkeys do not even understand that Allah may have multip names I don't know or multiple attributes anyway so ET in the Dua that's it so I wouldn't I wouldn't really spend much energy in that honestly there is this if you want to De the meaning it extract from them action and behavior and Fe and and spiritual States go to the Supreme the Supreme uh Target in in explaining or exes of the of the beautiful names IM Al gazali gazali yeah this will be sufficient I don't bother about 100 or million or trillion yeah okay um got some more submitted okay another one uh is watching Pro pornography prohibited absolutely regardless of its negative consequences that's what I've received no I I don't I don't know what what does the question that's what he said is watching prohibited pornography prohibited the issue is that um is clearly looking at is deliberately is is prohibited and exposing is even worse that's concerning as also exposing intercourse is is is an act of Shan you have to cover up for intercourse you don't do inter course in public all even if it's because most likely because because that people describing what happened them between their wife even verbally is not desirable or Haram okay it's it's most like Haram because said this is like a Shan who is doing intercourse with the Shan in publicly from that is that was in disregarding what what effect and he means that some people argue maybe for that because it has negative effects that's what that's what arguing from from what what lead what whatever it is for the the uh prohibiting by the called what leads to undesirable is or harmful is Haram and the question what does it mean leads by certainity and things like that that's an point so it's it question is not clear he said is it prohibited in itself or because it leads to some that's be question because it leads and doesn't lead is not is is not an argument until you prove either from text or from necessity of reason and perception that it leads there it may not lead for example some some may was something was something sexually exciting let's say pornography or imagine imagine your mind and for masturbation for example is that desirable undesirable just imagine it close his eye and imagine set a nice position and masturbate let let him answer that depending think about masturbation correct Point View it is it's no problem but even even that closing imagining that some have a viid fantasy and to each things they they imagine a certain position and so on so the pro prohibition here is in looking to the to the the the question was as discussed is it is it is looking at the picture of or the video of is looking like directly to or not is it is the picture of or not that's the point and and there's various issues there because the believer believing men women are ordered to to lower their gaze and if they see if they suddenly see like Allah what to do the sudden look you enter you push the door of the toilet and there's a woman there you don't know that she is inside then you see the Look Away close the door that's it but if you go there and look deliberately then you are looking into theat that would be because of the the various a and so on is prohibited because looking to private person people and their privacy is prohibited because someone was looking from the between the the the house of prophet was partly made out of like African huts with these these leaves woven leaves and there's some gaps and someone one man was looking through the gaps the almost punched his eye with with with a with with a long big needle and then he saw him the door what you doing here looking at that why why Allah ordered to make a to knock on the door to prevent looking to a to look to privacy so that's from that is looking at but real and so is a movie made besid most movies are usually made with with with c and so on assuming no believer participating such movies question is the hour of C the same like believer most likely you should not look at that you should prevent being in public so it's PR to look at that anyway would I I I don't understand why many people ask about that too much well it's obviously and if if you need it for masturbation use a good oil and cream and close your eyes and have nice imagination if it's if it helps okay we like to shy away from controversy here no it's not matter of controversy matter of simple question people made it complex the reason for this is becoming a big issue recently is that said the picture of is not and the Muslim Brotherhood went country up country down druming say you can look at you can watch pornography and so on and some shabab developed it further and looking into pornography and going to pornographic movies and so on I would say just just exercise good sense okay yeah I mean in this in this case I mean ultimately I can look there is an endemic problem especially with social media people with mobile devices there's many many examples of the youth you know even even Society even Kfar haven't recognized it there's even for example there's a famous um psychologist not psychologist neuroscientist examining the the detrimental impact on on this on people's psychologies in terms of relationships and all this kind of stuff even the kufar are recognizing that the detriments of it but the point is so so what I'm saying it's not it's not because of because his hasn't been relevant for 20 years it's because it's we're living in a society which is very promiscuous and the availability of this kind of mon on on devices on internet etc etc it's going to become it's going to affect everyone regardless of even if they're even remotely not Islamic it's going to affect our Generations that's that's I can see the merits of asking the question yeah so I agree in this case on the side of is what your what your recommendation is yeah and masturbation itself not being an absolute is not being there's no evidence to prohibit it so I guess s oh definitely definitely not no definitely definitely not I mean ultimately as a community make marriage easier is probably the best solution here yeah yeah obviously burn your the stupid culture the culture which makes it difficult to marry and but but there should in in in in a society ruled by by by Islamic law there will be no production of of definity of pornography definitely not this will require Zena and so on and there will be no selling or distribution because of prohibited material and and this is that done as a criminal act and they the LA will manage how to punish the people doing that and then they but you cannot prevent the people in the way of kuf to do that and broadcasted in television so can advise the people this a pornographic Chanel don't watch it say it has good news broadcast okay after the news shut it down and everyone with common sense will do that yeah so this became WID spread because of the decadence and the and the general easement in in matter of extra military relations and then both both a normal relation and homosexual relations and then became then then people started displaying that because they already for example in the west when they talk about pornography and so on you have already agreed that Zen is okay you call it love and then you agreed later to make also homo homosexual s sodic relation okay call it the other love so what's the problem of displaying it and having pictures and having movies no problem it's already permissible for you so so even they here discussion they discussing the wrong point of view the problem Start From Start zero that's where the problem started in time P there was barely any pornography when people were chased and most most women for example and until the end of the first world war almost every American woman 100% went into woodlock and she was virgin after the second world war only 60 46% were virgin so 50 were Al virginity within 30 years and after that now it's even catastrophic there's barely any there was one one girl she's virgin she said she is willing to to offer her virginity at again whatl or something for a million dollars and they were they were they were like an auction Facebook because he want to fin study became so Rarity that she's auctioning it things develop into a moer but the starting point is really that that extra relations are okay and then sodic relations are okay so then the issue of so the people in the west discussing por this damages and so on it's just just plowing in the sea it will lead nowhere the problem started there okay another question I'm not sure I mean look I I I get these questions and I ask them just as they are this this is an obvious one some somebody asked is lesbianism prohibited and what the evidence is to prohibit it yeah but the evidence is that because the the woman or you mean lesbian is a meaning meaning obviously women and women the the sexual action yeah that that's it yeah yeah no no no brushing it will be touching and and seeing the and the of include also the the strict from that from that point on for men is different there's a clear a clear clear statement the Quran for men for male that's a clear this is very clear but for woman it's only the issue of because it's necessar connected with seeing the and touching the yeah because of that cool so I got a following question from the same brother because what about non-muslims a do they have a especially if they explose themselves to publicly what is their a is is which is that because the for the believing Muslim men and woman is a honor is not is not because of anything physiological so for for Muslim woman most likely her body is not except the six genitals like from half the the that's what what in the in the AY concerning ta when they were naked in J and was send in the nth year with the caign read by Abu Bakr nth year and announced prohibiting to although it was part of their belief that's some kind of a devotion so it is interfering in their belief but never the less publicly you don't expose the and that was for men the genitals six genitals and woman a little bit more from half the thigh up to below the the G line essentially the hip hip and all the way to half the the knee the half the the thigh that cannot be exposed and that will be enforced by this the state by force if necessary for everyone otherwise that's all you can conclude from the I think we discussed that casually when we were at the not I think number 6 when Allah say now this because it's so it applies to two without the gender both male or female and the Ayah says you have to um punish them until they sorry you have to confine them until they um they repent yeah um so um so maybe you can expl expand on that because that would be applicable to um ladies and male L it maybe but the question you remember when we were at that if you read that session I said there are details of there which I don't want to indulge in it is it is it man and woman or is it and excluding the married woman who are who are married and they will be locked in the houses that's for married woman and then uh and then because it talks about so it's about inter so the the strongest point of view is that it talks about man and woman and the woman is not is not married because if she's married then the previous Ayah one a before is looking for Life till the death uh overtake them yeah and what is this referring to those who committed from woman then have four Witnesses but then the witness bring a prop witness which stand in a court of law then they are imprisoned at home or prevented from going until they die and then except those woman anybody else the man and the a woman who has not married etc for these they will be they they will be just just either insulted verbally or or flogged or something like that is not specified it seems to be this this ay just came after that when and both are abrogated by the AY of rajim and and and fling and then rajim has been Abate after that and flogging with has been modified to just flogging with but this is very deep but I think is almost certainly referring because talking about andah must be defined before and the case of woman and so is clearly fah meaning intercourse because you have to four Witnesses witness like like the usual detailed WI that they saw it they s the real intercourse you see my point so this is a detail of f which is I wouldn't really waste much time in that unless you are doing F or trying to drive a law for punishment final and so which can be done by the sh in the but the scholars discuss something it is man with man but doesn't work this way it could work for man with man also then it will give a punishment which has not been abated from man with man because this isah itah yes defined by was and that's that's that's the only evidence Quran that the man man relation is is because Allah pred allit all and this this speciic characteristic for Muhammad so the old prohibition of of sodomi is still valid reenacted by the by the general prohibition of f in the hand of otherwise we have no other by the way there's Noth about about sodomi or there's one or two that are most likely fabricate there tons of poor which everyone knows they fabricate but the even there's not Hadi about penalty and so that claim that Abu Bakr stoned someone or throw it from even that it's not valid yeah but that's prohibited definitely based on that Allah described for the people of of of L that they committing and they're doing evil acts and definitely are all prohibited by generally whatever is declar to be a it is prohibited mhamad must have prohibited by necessity just by mere being sent to prohibit allish and to prohibit all uh which is sexual immoralities in the narrow sense and and to prohibit to to to prohibit all all evil things yeah okay I got a brother wants to unmute um okay so too quick yes the brother want to unmute our brother with a Gmail account far away I was going to ask the question of what is your definition of an idol of an Idol idol yes Idol is is you mean which is having a shape of animal or shape man or something like Idol is is a statue which is supposed to refer or be a place of dwelling of a an entity which regarded as the F and I have another question uh that's that's that's what make statue an idol for example in book of do do you speak Arabic you read Arabic one second let me allow to unmute um yes bra can you answer the question no no no of course the chapter six when when we discussing the story of ibraim ibraim told his people what is this Tam this statue are devoted to they said they answered him you are mistaken this is not Idol meaning supposed to be connected to and the body of a certain deity those deities are for people of IIM we know they are the heavenly bodies and stars and some of them also satanic entities deep in the earth theim so Idol is AAL or a picture which has a human or animal form and the human body animal head and so on representing an deity if something which is not a of a living thing like head of animal body of or an shape of human or shape of animal with human or an animal with lion head or the lion with with with human head Etc uh that is if it's not like that like the cross that's Swan Wan is not so every Idol is wan but Wan is something general it's ID an idol or a symbol representing a a false Creed a Sher like the cross why the cross is an is a w some people could call it Idol but it's not it should not be called Idol it's SW the symbol of a belief that because the cross is a symbol of the the Christ dying on the cross to save Humanity from or or take them out of the clutches of the devil or or or or all of these are CER beliefs and this that's the reason the course is an idol it's a I don't know what but in in the in the Arabic language there's a clear distinction between and but this in the book of in chapter is much details which is not yet in the translation unfortunately okay braad if you got any following questions far away if not um next brother sad I advise everyone really to to go who who can read Arabic to go to the book of as available the 10 first chapters and these definitions are not in the first volume which is in Amazon not yet no unfor it will comes later not even the next one the next one will be only evidences of profood and so on it will come to the volume number three possibly insh good okay thank you okay bra can you hear me yes we can yeah I have two questions regarding what's happening I have a question regarding the who did not make his uh this week uh do you have any news about him or maybe he was contacted by to play a role because they are lacking of uh of leaders uh this is my first question and the second question is uh let me yeah let me answer this one first I have no idea I was wondered why he is not this Friday maybe he he is that your your options are reasonable ones especially the second one will be a good one if he's contacted this will be good that they coming to sense regarding that the sh is an asset uh my guess is that he decided not to give this time so that he doesn't need to comment on the matter because if he will comment he will be a little bit critical for the past and Advising things and he felt this maybe not the right time to do it Poss it could be that that he in a place which had been bumped Allah we don't know it could be very well that he mured why not but you don't know so then may Allah Elevate his yes I I don't I know that it is a very good idea to put him as a leader because he can move forward the sectarian thing which is between Sunni and Sh absolutely absolutely I agree with you but this is this is a dream hopefully maybe we should dream if Iran has moved forward this sectarian ideas and this uh hopefully we can only make Dua in that anyway we discuss that inan issue in more detail insh what's the second question yes my second question is I saw I I come from Moroccan origin and I saw today there is a March a demonstration for one year for and uh we saw uh hundred of thousand of people pictures of is Yassin and even fuad Sher so it was really good thing to see but the thing maybe I am too young to understand I want to ask you this question

## What is the difference between the cut off Hadith and the interrupted Hadith? 
**Category:** Hadith Terminology

**Timestamp:** 4.279s

The speaker explains that there is a distinction between the "cut off Hadith" and the "interrupted Hadith." He states that the cut off Hadith is a report that concerns the words and deeds of the Prophet's followers and ends there. In contrast, the interrupted Hadith is one that is interrupted or disconnected from the Prophet's chain of narration.


## What is the general point of view regarding the cut off Hadith?
**Category:** Hadith Interpretation

**Timestamp:** 79.6s

The speaker explains that the general view regarding cut off Hadiths is that they are not considered as reliable. He argues that the companions were not infallible and might have made mistakes in their reports. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious when accepting such Hadiths as authentic.


## How do the scholars of Hadith classify the companions? 
**Category:** Hadith Classification

**Timestamp:** 128.56s

The speaker talks about how the companions are classified by Hadith scholars. He states that the companions are divided into three categories: 
1. The senior companions who could have become companions if they had come to Medina but missed the opportunity.
2. The companions who met the Prophet before his death but were adults. 
3. The companions who met the Prophet but were very young. 


## Why are the companions who were very young when they met the Prophet often classified differently?
**Category:** Hadith Classification

**Timestamp:** 160.239s

The speaker explains that the companions who were very young when they met the Prophet are classified differently because they were not able to fully comprehend the teachings of the Prophet. He cites the example of Umar ibn al-Khattab's obituary and how it was narrated by a companion who was very young at the time. 


## Why do the books of the companions not present an issue of scrutiny in the Hadith science? 
**Category:** Hadith Authenticity

**Timestamp:** 213.92s

The speaker asserts that the books of the companions do not present an issue of scrutiny because they were written during a time when manuscripts and written materials were readily available. He suggests that the books were widely accessible and in the hands of the people, allowing for easy verification.


## What is the argument that the cut off Hadith is interpreted as 'interrupted'? 
**Category:** Hadith Terminology

**Timestamp:** 307.84s

The speaker mentions that the term "cut off Hadith" is sometimes interpreted as "interrupted." He explains that this interpretation is based on the remarks of Imam Shafi'i and other scholars who considered cut off Hadiths as unconnected to the Prophet's chain of narration.


## Why are the statements of the companions, such as 'we used to do such and such,' categorized as 'halted Hadiths'? 
**Category:** Hadith Classification

**Timestamp:** 347.72s

The speaker states that statements by the companions, like "we used to do such and such," fall under the category of "halted Hadiths" if they do not explicitly link the action to the Prophet's time. This is because the companions' actions or sayings might not necessarily represent the Prophet's teachings. 


## Why is Abu Bakr al-Barani's opinion about the statement of the companions' 'tacit ascent' considered incorrect? 
**Category:** Hadith Interpretation

**Timestamp:** 439.52s

The speaker explains that Abu Bakr al-Barani's view on the companions' "tacit ascent" as a form of Sunnah is refuted because it assumes that the Prophet tacitly approved every action or saying of his companions. However, this is not necessarily true, as the Prophet might not have been aware of everything his companions were doing or saying. He clarifies that Allah's witness is relevant in the context of legislation, not the Prophet's, and that the Prophet might have rebuked certain actions even if he wasn't present when they were taking place. 


## Why is the argument that the companion's silence indicates approval problematic? 
**Category:** Hadith Interpretation

**Timestamp:** 663.279s

The speaker challenges the notion that the Prophet's silence indicates approval by saying that this interpretation is "strange." He argues that silence does not necessarily imply approval, and that the Prophet's silence might have been due to other reasons, such as not knowing about a specific action or not considering it relevant to legislation.


## What is the key issue with the companions' statements about 'we used to do such and such'? 
**Category:** Hadith Interpretation

**Timestamp:** 1301.44s

The speaker highlights the main issue with statements by the companions like "we used to do such and such." He explains that these statements often indicate actions or practices that were considered permissible or desirable at the time, but not necessarily obligatory. The speaker emphasizes that such statements need to be scrutinized to understand their context and true meaning.


## What is the argument against the statement of Umar ibn al-Khattab regarding the diyah (blood money) of a woman? 
**Category:** Islamic Law

**Timestamp:** 1705.12s

The speaker refutes a statement by Umar ibn al-Khattab about the diyah of a woman. He argues that the statement is wrong because it contradicts the established principle that the diyah of a woman is half that of a man. This is a significant issue as it involves legal rulings and should be properly clarified.


## Why is the argument that 'we only take the verbal order of the messenger' incorrect? 
**Category:** Hadith Interpretation

**Timestamp:** 2383.76s

The speaker rejects the notion that we should only consider the Prophet's verbal orders and disregard his actions. He argues that this approach is not accurate and that the Prophet's actions can also be considered a source of guidance and authority. He emphasizes that both verbal orders and actions are integral parts of Islamic teachings.


## What is the point of view on the companions' commentary regarding the circumstances of revelation of a Quranic verse? 
**Category:** Hadith Interpretation

**Timestamp:** 2120.88s

The speaker clarifies that the companions' commentary regarding the circumstances of revelation of a Quranic verse is considered a "supported Hadith" because it provides valuable insights into the historical context of the verse. He states that such interpretations are important for understanding the meaning and application of the verse.

Hamas allowed Israeli forces to penetrate deep into their territory, leading them to believe they were gaining ground. However, this was a strategic maneuver, resulting in the Israeli units being surrounded and facing annihilation.

*Category:  International Relations*
The speaker describes the US's failed attempt to form a coalition against Yemen's blockade of Israel. They note that most countries, including France, Holland, Spain, and Austria, withdrew their support, leaving only Britain in the coalition.  They argue that this is symbolic and ineffective, and reflects the moral pressure on Iran to act against Israel due to their perceived failure to do so previously.

**447.759s : the Irani leadership which I believe they MAF and traitor and under moral pressure that they have to do something to cover their their shame and their failure to do anything significant before that anything really significant battle decisive it seems to be and also it seems to be encouraging the milit the the Revolutionary guard inside Iran to to put pressure on the leadership or even act independent from leadership**
*Category:  International Relations*
The speaker suggests that Iran's leadership is under pressure to act against Israel, driven by a desire to cover their perceived inaction in the conflict and save face. This pressure, they argue, might be encouraging Iran's Revolutionary Guard to take independent action, or to push for more decisive action from the leadership.

**513.44s : sink and the American did not say anything they say Iran is behind that as the usual rhetoric but no action whatsoever because they know any action which is not less than a massive Invasion with 100,000 people which is impossible now and not conceivable will fail will end a disaster so the YY started really calling the American Bluff and they exposed they exposed it now it seems to be their forces inside Iran not the leadership and not the the the the Deep state which is still inherited from the time of Bah and so on like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and all these guys semi secular semi maaf no the Revolutionary God which is all in all generally Islamic and and internationalist and pro Palestine genuinely Pro Palestine they seem to be ass setting you may you may have here last time we discussed that there are two significant statement coming from two important generals of the Revolution God one was I did not regard that as very significant at the beginning but now it GES more significant is from is**
*Category:  International Relations*
The speaker discusses the US response to the attack on the Israeli ship, highlighting their lack of action despite blaming Iran. They argue that the US is unable to take significant military action due to the potential for disaster. They then suggest that the attack was likely carried out by Iran's Revolutionary Guard, acting independently or against the wishes of the leadership.

**570.48s : aani this one was Ilia but after the miserable speech of Hass what does he say uh he said addressing it to the leader of Hamas under his name with his sign that we are with you until the end and we'll fight with you until the end I said that maybe the leadership that wanted to cover the shame and ordered him to send something like that but seems to be that's his own writing without even getting a green light from the leadership that's the commander of the British revolutionary God in Syria then later on a much more significant statement from salami husin salami General salami in a meeting of the either Commander rary God or in a in a in a public lecture or something like in a function in he said the following very interesting and significant sentence what did he say**

The speaker delves deeper into the statement made by the Iranian General, highlighting his contradiction of the Iranian government's line on the conflict with Israel.

This suggests a growing internal conflict within Iran regarding their strategy and involvement in the conflict.

**791.32s : meaning the the sending of the two aircrafts carer immediate few days after the beginning of the 7th of October to intimidate everyone was as I said at that time to everyone and they commented especially in Arabic this is not pure Bluff they were not going to do anything that bluff was not called by anybody really genuinely neither byan they chickened out or they have already never they were never bothered but they liked that and took it as a pretext to to to to bail out and betray either whatever the analis may be they did not call the bluff they do not call the BL with the result is that they missed the opportunity to be really making history they are out of History whatever they do now maybe bring a bit of fig Leaf maybe help them a little bit but it is it's not going to save them they have lost they have lost the that what they could have achieved by standing really beside of Gaza something more more firm and strong because of their n hypocrisy or Cardis while the Y called The Bluff they insisted they called for General mobilization and they made such statement and such action which is very clear showing putting America in his corner but also interesting for the statements it's not this week that was before they said we know exactly what happened to America in Saigon and in Cabo meaning you will get another Cabo here so don't try just stay where you are and the reality and most most shipping companies they World recognizes that America is not they they recognized Al they called the American say we're not going to go in a risk we're just going to go around**
*Category:  International Relations*
The speaker reflects on the US's failed attempt to intimidate Yemen with the deployment of aircraft carriers. They argue that the US ultimately backed down from any meaningful action, missing an opportunity to make a significant impact on the situation. In contrast, they praise Yemen for calling the US bluff and showing greater resolve in their support of Palestine.

**910.44s : Additionally the action of the Yemen encouraged someone who was qu generally quite weak and Mild that's Anar Ibrahim the prime minister of Malaysia to is an order that no Israeli ship or ships carrying goods for Israel can stop in any and any Malaysian Port hopefully this would encourage may take some time May encourage Indonesia to do the same the same for their own for and also for the street of Maraga that's will be really an international shock now can they do that is there a danger for America no the same way like bab Mand we are not preventing anybody the the international trade is guaranteed and perfect but those criminals in Palestine those committing genocide no neither any ship owned by them or in full or part or any Goods going to them will be allowed to if they want to go they can go behind South ofia near Australia and go there adding 5,000 km to the road that's they can chose that but they not going to go the street of Maraga we are not allowing that everyone else is welcome here go we protect international trade and so but not not those committing war crimes and genocide I think the can do that hopefully they will do that soon this will add one further component to this C**
*Category:  International Relations*
The speaker discusses the growing international pressure on Israel, highlighting the actions of Malaysia and the potential for Indonesia to follow suit. These countries have implemented restrictions on Israeli ships and goods, effectively isolating Israel further. They argue that these actions are not a threat to international trade, but a measure to hold Israel accountable for their actions.

**982.319s : questions uh so what what is obviously uh houti had some uh assistance from Iran uh throughout history you know um to undermines Saudi how in people are of the impression maybe this is instigated by Iran how do you determine that they're independent they independent that's that's clear every analyst know that there was analysis one one analyst lady from chatam Institute some was commenting and she said it's laughable to claim that the are are proxy for Iran said the Iranian they were forced to give the H some support the H approached them seven eight years back because they are in general time Shia and so on and also the father ABD Maliki was in Iran for many years in Exile and so on so they were obliged to do something but at the same time she said clearly that a very important sentence they at the same time also supporting some separation separationist forces in South in which are hostile to thei so they're playing all CS so they cannot be a proxy that's what she said unless we say that the Sai are proxy to to Britain because Britain is supplying massive amount of weapons and so on she actually said if any one of these two is a proxy for the one who supplying with the Saudi is are more proxy than the Y that's it Iran has shown it shown what salami said is clear Iran is not interested to to the conflict they're not interested and has been fooling the Revolution by saying we need 25 years maybe he thinks that maybe he's a coward maybe that's what the way his level of analys of but anyway that's what he what his stand at that moment he's F the sh bson one the sh bson like BS way of doing things in terms of normalize strengthen and whatever you know like it's a parallel Multiverse there are people like that mentality people have lost trust in Allah and in themselves**
*Category:  Conflict Analysis*
The speaker addresses the question of Iranian support for the Houthis in Yemen, arguing that they are not simply proxies of Iran. They cite an analyst's statement that while Iran has provided support to the Houthis, they are also supporting separatist forces in the South, indicating they are playing a complex geopolitical game.  They further argue that Iran is not truly committed to the conflict and is likely using the Houthis to achieve its own strategic goals.

**1107.84s : question relates to how much uh does the houthi zi ideolog ideas factor in in their stance so just reading out so what's in Islam in islamist anyone belong to Islam would should have the same stance the question is he sincerely committed to that and willing to fight for it or not that's the question that's a question has nothing to do with being being being zi or being imami or being Sunni or something no are you committed to to fight for Islam and Muslim and defend and willing to fight and sacrifice are you really trusting Allah trusting yourself fine otherwise you're not I know this is a natural question because obviously we're from Sunny background and a lot of copies no no no Iran has has always claimed they are supporting and so on and they they did plenty of support in material things in supplies and in technology and so on but when the moment came where you have to stand and face the sword they seconden out or their their NE has been exposed so all what we are doing before that is either to cover up the crime in Syria claiming are we doing that in Syria just because allowing that what's happening in Syria that that regime is sted meaning the the the resistance front will collapse and then isra will get away that's what the argument they have been blabbering for the last 10 years it could it is very possible that this argument is a fake one and they hypocrit and liar from the beginning that's a possibility another possibility no maybe they will be they they were F by the because the because the Syrian regime B party of Syria is one of the most cunning and filthy uh secular organization the Muslim world as as as hostile to Islam and Muslim as you could imagine and they were they were intelligent enough to to get Iran on their side claiming that they are resistance gr and they are protecting the the graves of the imams of the Shia and protecting this and protecting this and protecting this they may have F the Iranian so the Iranian were really fighting they thinking they are helping the palestin kid but they were not up to the historic challenge to stand firm in in the confrontation and clearly it seemed to be Hamas was having some doubt about the Iranian position and hisbah position so they did not inform them about about the exact there was an idea that we'll do something like that it was generally agreed upon we we fix the date in due course and we do the action let's say for example it may be agreed we do it at Christmas but then hamsa we decided we do it well ahead of time so that the issue does not leak or they got a news that the Israelis are aware because Egyptian having also spies inside Hamas and so on and is well known that abas K the intelligence chief of Egypt is is an Israeli agent and he passes all information to Israel so to preempt that and he possibly he passed to isra there's a plan for something like that and so in general but we don't know the date and the Israelis or we know that the date is later for example Christmas or something like that and relying on that were happy that nothing will happen now and then they were surprised by the DAT what whatever it is very dark until we get all these details what's going behind the scene but all indication is that everyone was surprised by the fixing of the date as was surprised and the the one who gave him the news said he was he appeared to be confused and not and he was asking did isra start attack who who did start what's going on what's Happening he completely unaware until he he was clearly told it is actually Hamas who started which seems to be here he could not conceive that it's happening at that time that was not agreed upon time or there was no agreement yet so sise why Hamas did not inform them I believe partly obviously to keep the secrecy as much as possible or they informed about another fake date because they knew somehow it will leak to to the Egyptian intelligence abas Kam this Zionist agent in Cairo the intelligence Chief and the will be leaked so it's better to give a PA date down the road maybe next year or Christmas or something like that and then strike before that in another occasion where nobody is prepared or and or they have doubt about this the the firmness and the sincerity of of hisbah and Iran that they will stand in the case of Confrontation which had turned out to be true and they may have doubt if they have doubt and this part of the reason they did not inform them**

They also discuss the complexities of Iranian support for the Houthis, raising doubts about their true intentions and highlighting the potential for hypocrisy and manipulation.

**1408.52s : that's that's a great news because this means that they are now becoming sufficiently politically anal analytic and Savvy to to to recognize that these people are not reliable 100% that's good because generally organization coming from the womb of Muslim Brotherhood are known to be derish to be derish in in matter of political analysis easily taken for a ride and behaving like idiots politically which has happened through history until now we see it every day almost but seem to be Hamas had graduated out of that most likely because they are interacting and cooperating with the Jihad that's not that's not originally it's not originally aani group cooperating with some factions of fat the sincere part of f with the with the popular front which are not islamist Etc that widen their Horizon and they have access to information about fat the fat past and the communication and the relation with the other uh with the other regimes and groups and they they sufficiently sa to recognize most of these in the field cannot be relied upon they are the traitor or they sell outs or they are cards and or ready to sit out so be cautious cooperate with them but watch carefully know the limit of disclosure and things like that I hope that's my that's my hope if that's it then this is a great news because we need need Hamas to be up to the challenge of historical moment you cannot be at the historic moment if you just trust everyone blindly even even the fact that that that they give q a lot of because is obviously adopted the Muslim Brotherhood and used them as a shield for the regime fine okay we use you and give you even some bonuses and let you do negotiation and give you some achievements and make you look nice okay perfectly fine but trust them completely does not seem to be the case because the meeting of is and and and and mush and other leaders who went from Lebanon they did not meet inq nor in Iran where did they meet they meet in Turkey now some say turkey is is is a mavian and possibly maaf maybe but the Turkish State and the Turkish intelligence is firmly on our count despite allism of ofan and so on Vian is definitely in our C without any doubt although obviously because of nature of turkey and politics in Turkey for the last century is a extremely anti-islamic maavan European style management not an Islamic sty so he may appear doing the same like the Western powers do negotiating selling out buying and so on but not and to some part is are in our camp so that meeting in which they were discussing obviously how to proceed what will happen in the future how to deal with the situation Iran hisbah did not happen in Q Al the Q doing negotiation on their behalf with isra and they gave them a lot of benefit and address it to them thanks publicly and things like that by the way America also Biden always thank k for their mediation and so on putting them high up they don't do that they don't do in Iran which is clear because the position of Iran and the failure to stand firm is clear or the or the their loss of courage and chickening out is clear so they did it in the only place remaining which makes some sense and there's some protection is in Turkey Des spite of all what is being rumored and said now partly through that still business people in Turkey still are communicating with isra and sending goods and services and so on and th had not been cut it will be cut it will be one day it will be cut be cut because we should not forget that turkey is part of the West until now politically and constitutionally part of the West they are member of NATO they are not they are not an Islamic country like that the rest of Muslim country only nominally it belongs internationally and according to the current situation at least in the last century they belong to the West they don't belong to us so whatever they do with us will be under the cover done in a certain Secret way cutting the relation directly like for stopping the shiing and so on to isra cannot be done immediately and it could be it could be if had the courage but his nature being a mavan and opportunist prevented from there he could have done that the other things which do not cost money and do cause much problem he can do like talking big like a drum drumming and also filing genocidal claims against isra in the IC that he can attacking nany calling him a traitor and enemy of turkey all this he can do but real action like stopping the the contracts and the supply of oil and so on he is not yet to the stage or he doesn't recognize that as beneficial to be done now it should have been done don't misunderstand it should have been done from a sincere Muslim it should have been done but he's not doing it so that's that's roughly the situation it looks like it looks like I I don't think that that uh that uh uh that uh the skirmishes and the fight and R will continue for several more months maybe one or two weeks because uh Biden is is is sinking and he he cannot continue and also all his demand for money for for Ukraine and for Israel is being stuiz by the parliament very sely uh especially by the Senate but also by the House of Representative is under now an impeachment investigation and also there's a there's a strong popular wave against him all in all even you see even the campaign of trump election campaign in the recent all his recent statement about the poison of the immigrants poisoning the blood of America he's barely mentioning anything about iside because you know this is a losing card so it's clear that the pressure from America will be mounting further further on Israel does not prevent that the isra leadership lose their lose their mind like they lost after seven of October and started this bombing C gu which destroyed them internationally and morally that they may think we have just just we are sinking in a in an never ending deep hole let's attack Lebanon or something that is unlikely but if someone loses his mind and is blinded by by by fear of imprisonment like Netanyahu and fear of of admitting feet he may try to do something something like James Bond action Rambo that style action against against hisb or something like that and thenb will have no choice except to attack in the depth of we should finish the business much faster but this is only if they are completely blinded and if America does not put enormous pressure on them not to do so they're putting definitely pressure but will they increase the pressure to the listen any wrong move no more weapons no more money nothing finish we finish with you until that they didn't reach that level now but I think they will reach it soon because you look at what what the disaster in in the in the Red Sea with the Y it's gone it's finished the defeat is complete there and now what the Irani are doing in the Indian Ocean attacking ships and they got away with this attack you will see tomorrow one day after tomorrow more attacks of this Ty it will increase**

##  1.14s:  [Theorism]

**Question:** Why is the classical theorism considered faulty?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker argues that attributing certain attributes to Allah (God) within classical theorism is incorrect and a mistake. These attributes, based on the premises of necessity, possibility, and contingency, lead to contradictions.  The speaker believes that these premises are often obscure, undefined, and blatantly false. 

## 71.4s:  [Classical Theorism]

**Question:** What is the main issue with the classical theorism? 

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker points out that the classical theorism attributes certain attributes to Allah (God) that are wrong. This error stems from the theorism's focus on necessity and determinism, which contradicts the reality of free will and choice. This contradiction makes the classical theorism incompatible with human perception and experience.

## 98.579s:  [Scriptural Interpretation]

**Question:**  How should one approach understanding the scriptures?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker suggests returning to the scriptures and analyzing them correctly. This means starting from basic assumptions about necessities and contingencies and working from there. This approach helps remove fallacies and avoids relying on flawed premises.

## 150.84s:  [Mind and God]

**Question:** Why is it important that the human mind has even a limited understanding of concepts like time and space? 

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker argues that for a human mind to comprehend the Divine, it must have some fundamental understanding of concepts like time and space. This limited understanding allows for a projection of the infinite (God) onto the finite (human mind). The speaker uses the idea of "being created in God's image" as a metaphor for this projection.

## 200.159s:  [Free Will]

**Question:** Why is free will essential for the existence of commands and revelations?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker asserts that free will is essential for the existence of commands and revelations. If there is no genuine freedom, then commands would be meaningless and revelations would be illusions. The human mind, despite its limitations, must possess a degree of freedom to make sense of divine directives. 

## 253.879s:  [Human Knowledge]

**Question:** How does human knowledge compare to comprehensive knowledge?

**Category:** Epistemology

**Answer:** The speaker points out that human knowledge is inherently limited. We cannot fully comprehend the details of everything, such as a person's tissues and organs or the development of cancer cells. However, we can grasp essential facts and principles without needing to know every detail. This limitation in human knowledge doesn't invalidate our ability to understand fundamental truths.

## 292.8s:  [Quran and Human Mind]

**Question:** What does the Quran say about the human mind's capabilities?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker cites the Quran to emphasize that the human mind is designed to make sense of the world through naming, conceptualization, and language. This capability allows us to attribute meaning and understanding to our experiences. The Quran asserts that God bestowed this capability on humans.

## 332.039s:  [Human Knowledge and Truth]

**Question:** Does the human mind's limitations preclude us from understanding the core of truth? 

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker argues that the human mind, while limited, is capable of understanding core truths. The argument that we only know what we are taught is not entirely accurate. Our minds are fundamentally capable of making sense of the world and grasping essential concepts. This ability is necessary for any meaningful discourse on reality or revelation.

## 371.82s:  [Language and the Impossible]

**Question:** Can language encompass the impossible?

**Category:** Language

**Answer:**  The speaker explains that despite the limitations of language, we can still refer to or name impossible concepts. This happens through linguistic references that point to something that doesn't exist in a concrete way. Just like a null pointer in programming, these linguistic references can hold a placeholder for an impossible concept.

## 449.94s:  [General Capability and Truth]

**Question:** Can our general capability as humans lead us to truths as they truly are?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker believes that our general capabilities, if properly applied, can lead us to truths as they exist. If this capability is dismissed as illusory, then the whole concept of revelation and even the Quran itself becomes an illusion. This understanding of truth is crucial for interpreting divine messages and understanding the world.

## 476.46s:  [Expanding Divine Knowledge]

**Question:**  How can we expand our understanding of divine knowledge?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker suggests that we can expand our understanding of divine knowledge by using our limited tools and capabilities.

**Question:** Why does the speaker say the existence of a "square circle" is a trivial matter? 

**Category:** Logic

**Answer:** The speaker uses the concept of a "square circle" to illustrate the absurdity of some claims.  The speaker emphasizes that the existence of a "square circle" is a trivial impossibility. It's a concept that is so fundamentally contradictory that it doesn't require extensive analysis to understand its impossibility.

## 533.82s:  [Ontological Argument]

**Question:**  What was the speaker reading about and what point did they make regarding this topic? 

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker was reading about the purely ontological argument of Anselm of Canterbury. The speaker argues that the definition of God as "the one who knows no perfect being" leads to a contradiction.  Knowing a negative requires comprehensive knowledge of the positive, which then creates a paradox where the being who knows no perfect being must be God.

## 619.14s:  [Perfect Knowledge]

**Question:**  How should we approach understanding the attribute of "perfect knowledge"?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker suggests that we should analyze the attribute of "perfect knowledge" in a more structured way.

## 805.92s:  [Omnipotence]

**Question:** How does the definition of omnipotence become problematic?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker argues that defining omnipotence as the ability to do everything can lead to contradictions. They explain that the concept of omnipotence cannot encompass necessary actions or impossible actions. Only contingent things can be created or attended to. This implies that omnipotence has its own limitations, which need to be considered when defining the attribute.

## 863.899s:  [Attributes of God]

**Question:**  What is the issue with defining God solely by the attribute of omnipotence?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker criticizes the definition of God solely by omnipotence, arguing that it's problematic in both Western and Christian discourse.  This attribute alone leads to contradictions and raises questions about how God allows evil in the world.  Adding other attributes can also create further contradictions, as seen in Christian theology with the concept of God having a son.

## 929.22s:  [Classical Definition of God]

**Question:** What is the speaker's critique of the classical definition of God in both Christian and Muslim contexts?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker critiques the classical definition of God in both Christian and Muslim contexts.  The speaker argues that both definitions are flawed, leading to contradictions. They believe that the Christian image of God is based on myths and exaggerations, while the Ash'ari understanding of God leads to a deterministic worldview where there is no room for events happening in God's being.

## 952.8s:  [Time and God]

**Question:** What issues arise when considering time in relation to God?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker addresses the complexities of time in relation to God. They argue that things that begin in time must have a cause, but the classical theorism runs into contradictions when trying to reconcile this with the concept of an eternal, non-eventful God.  This issue highlights the challenges of understanding the relationship between time and the Divine.

## 1059.32s:  [Event and Beginning]

**Question:** What is the speaker's critique of the idea that anything with events must have a beginning? 

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker disagrees with the idea that anything with events must have a beginning. They argue that this is not a true principle and that the Quran offers a different perspective. The example of the leaves falling in time suggests that God's knowledge of events happening in time doesn't imply that these events exist eternally or are outside of time.

## 1100.88s:  [Scriptural Guidance and Philosophy]

**Question:** Why does the speaker suggest that Ash'ari theologians should have taken more guidance from the Quran?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker believes that Ash'ari theologians made a mistake by mixing Quranic teachings with philosophical ideas that were not yet fully developed.  They argue that the Ash'ari approach led to a focus on events and determinism, neglecting the more complex and nuanced understanding of contingency and necessity found in the Quran.

## 1127.0s:  [Best Possible Universe]

**Question:** How does the idea of a "best possible universe" become problematic?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker questions the concept of a "best possible universe." They argue that since the universe may be multi-dimensional and potentially infinite, there may be no absolute "best" possible universe.  This challenges the assumption that God must have created the "best" possible world, as there may be an infinite number of options.

## 1214.52s:  [Starting Point for Understanding God]

**Question:**  What is the best starting point for understanding God?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker believes that the best starting point for understanding God is to acknowledge the existence of reason and self-existence. These basic principles, along with our internal perceptions of space and time, offer a solid foundation for further philosophical inquiry. 

## 1261.2s:  [Time's Direction]

**Question:**  What is the fundamental nature of time's direction?

**Category:** Physics

**Answer:** The speaker explains that time has a unidirectional nature, moving forward from the past to the future. This is fundamentally different from the idea of moving backward in time. This understanding of time's direction is essential for considering the nature of the universe and its origins.

## 1285.14s:  [Time and Quantum Mechanics]

**Question:**  How does quantum mechanics view the concept of time?

**Category:** Physics

They mention the Penrose model, which suggests a cyclic universe that expands and contracts without reaching a complete state of nothingness.

## 1334.88s:  [Determinism and Quantum Fluctuation]

**Question:** What contradiction arises when considering determinism and quantum fluctuation?

**Category:** Physics

**Answer:** The speaker highlights the contradiction between determinism and quantum fluctuation. They argue that a deterministic universe would not allow for quantum fluctuation, as these fluctuations are inherently indeterminate. However, experiments have shown that quantum fluctuation exists. This suggests that the universe is not completely deterministic.

## 1373.94s:  [Free Will and Experimentation]

**Question:** How does the existence of free will relate to the scientific process?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that free will is essential for the scientific process.  They argue that our free will allows us to make choices, conduct experiments, and explore the universe.  A completely deterministic universe would not allow for these choices, leading to a contradiction with our own experience and the scientific evidence.

## 1425.419s:  [Mathematical Models and Infinity]

**Question:** Why does the speaker suggest that mathematical models are better suited for analyzing concepts like infinity and circularity? 

**Category:** Mathematics

**Answer:** The speaker believes that mathematical models are better suited for analyzing concepts like infinity and circularity.  They argue that verbal expressions and ontological arguments struggle to adequately capture the complexities of these concepts.  Mathematical formulas allow for a more precise and rigorous exploration of infinite and cyclic phenomena.

## 1470.48s:  [Penrose Model and the Universe]

**Question:**  How does the Penrose model affect our understanding of the universe's origins?

**Category:** Physics

**Answer:** The speaker suggests that the Penrose model, which describes a cyclic universe that expands and contracts without reaching a complete state of nothingness, offers an alternative to the Big Bang theory. This model suggests that the universe may not have a true beginning, which challenges traditional understandings of its origins.

## 1485.72s:  [Big Bang Theory]

**Question:** What is the speaker's stance on the Big Bang theory?

**Category:** Physics

**Answer:** The speaker seems to be open to the idea of a "big bug" solution, which suggests a universe that expands from a small black hole.  They argue that this model, combined with evidence of universal expansion, may be a more accurate representation of the universe's origins.

## 1510.38s:  [Universal Expansion]

**Question:**  What is the speaker's question regarding the expansion of the universe?

**Category:** Physics

**Answer:** The speaker questions whether the expansion of the universe is truly from a singularity or from a small black hole. They argue that if it's from a small black hole, then this black hole must have been shrinking before its expansion, suggesting a cyclic model for the universe. 

## 1530.24s:  [Circular Universe]

**Question:**  Why does the speaker believe the universe must be circular?

**Category:** Physics

**Answer:** The speaker believes that the universe must be circular to avoid reaching a true beginning. A circular universe, where the process of expansion and contraction repeats infinitely, avoids the issue of a single point of origin. However, experimental evidence has suggested that a circular universe is not a likely possibility.

## 1571.88s:  [Modality]

**Question:**  How long has the concept of modality been discussed and when did it become formalized?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker explains that modality has been discussed for centuries, with early discussions by Aristotle. However, the formalization of modality occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  This concept is crucial for understanding concepts like necessity, contingency, and obligation.

## 1625.179s:  [Islamic Discourse on Modality]

**Question:**  Is the speaker aware of any Muslim scholars who are discussing modality?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker doesn't seem to be aware of any prominent Muslim scholars currently discussing modality. They mention that the discourse in the Muslim world tends to focus on other arguments, like those presented by William Lane Craig and other Christian apologists.

## 1650.32s:  [Validity of Modality]

**Question:**  What does the speaker say about the validity of modality arguments?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:**  The speaker acknowledges that modality arguments are valid but require further development and clarification. They suggest that these arguments need to be rephrased and made more robust by addressing specific issues within modality.

## 1659.659s:  [Agnosticism]

**Question:** How do agnostics use the idea of limited knowledge to support their position?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** Agnostics often argue that our limited knowledge prevents us from definitively knowing whether God exists. They suggest that we should defer judgment until we have a clearer picture. The speaker counters this by stating that our knowledge is capable of discerning truth and falsity within certain axiomatic frameworks. 

## 1724.64s:  [Limited Mind]

**Question:** What is the speaker's view on the limitations of the human mind?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:** The speaker acknowledges the limitations of the human mind but argues that these limitations don't prevent us from understanding essential truths.  We may be limited in our knowledge, but our minds are capable of making judgments about the world and deciding on truth and falsity within certain frameworks. 

## 1742.84s:  [Agnosticism and Knowledge]

**Question:** Why does the speaker consider agnosticism a form of "Hiatus" in discussions about God?

**Category:** Philosophy

**Answer:**  The speaker sees agnosticism as a kind of "Hiatus" in discussions about God. They believe that while agnostics may claim they lack knowledge, this is often a form of avoiding the issue rather than genuinely seeking knowledge. The speaker believes that we have ways of knowing, and while the path to understanding God may be challenging, we shouldn't stop searching for answers.

## 1764.24s:  [Prophethood]

**Question:** How does prophethood provide a "fast track" to understanding God?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker suggests that prophethood offers a "fast track" to understanding God. They argue that through the fulfilled prophecies of prophets, we can gain insight into the divine. The "Einstein condition" for prophethood, which requires a prophecy to be established, fulfilled independently of the prophet, and unique enough to rule out chance, adds further weight to the evidence for prophetic claims.

## 1844.539s:  [Supernatural Knowledge]

**Question:** What does the speaker say about the source of knowledge for someone who can know the future?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker believes that the knowledge of the future must come from a supernatural source. They reject the idea of a person controlling the future, arguing that this is impossible.  Instead, they believe that the ability to know the future stems from a power beyond the natural world, a power that can even influence the course of evolution.

## 1876.74s:  [Daniel's Prophecy]

**Question:** What example does the speaker give to illustrate the validity of prophecy? 

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker refers to the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah in the book of Daniel.

## 2011.82s:  [Purpose of Prophets]

**Question:** What is the main purpose of prophets, according to the speaker?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker explains that prophets serve a vital purpose in guiding humanity. They act as a bridge between the divine and the human, clarifying complex issues and dispelling doubts. Prophets, especially through their material miracles, offer evidence of their divine mission and help to solidify faith.

## 2048.04s:  [Testing Prophets]

**Question:** What test does the speaker mention for identifying true prophets?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker cites a passage from the Old Testament where the test for identifying a true prophet is the fulfillment of their prophecies.  If the prophecies come true, then the person is a prophet; if not, they should be ignored. This test emphasizes the importance of verifiable evidence in determining the authenticity of prophetic claims.

## 2079.0s:  [Miracles and Prophethood]

**Question:** Why does the speaker consider prophecies more important than miracles?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker prioritizes prophecies over miracles as a more reliable sign of a true prophet. They argue that miracles, like the parting of the sea or the splitting of the moon, can be explained away with claims of hypnosis, witchcraft, or other natural phenomena.  Prophecies, on the other hand, are more difficult to dismiss, as they are not subject to the same level of interpretation or manipulation.

## 2143.02s:  [Physical Miracles in Primitive Societies]

**Question:** Why might physical miracles be more prevalent in primitive societies?

**Category:** Anthropology

**Answer:** The speaker suggests that physical miracles might be more prevalent in primitive societies due to their reliance on physical manifestations as a means of establishing truth.  As societies become more advanced, they develop more sophisticated ways of understanding the world, and the reliance on physical miracles might diminish.

## 2158.82s:  [Claiming Prophethood]

**Question:** What are the potential consequences of claiming prophethood?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker acknowledges that claiming prophethood can be dangerous.  Someone claiming to be a prophet could be mentally deranged or deliberately deceiving people. This underscores the importance of careful scrutiny when evaluating prophetic claims.

## 2167.079s:  [Miracles and Reviewability]

**Question:**  What is the speaker's point regarding the reviewability of miracles?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker emphasizes that some miracles, like those involving a physical event like a meteorite strike, are impossible to review or verify objectively. This is because the prophet has no control over the universe and the probability of such an event happening exactly as described is extremely low. This suggests that such miracles might offer strong evidence for a divine intervention.

## 2217.18s:  [Divine Control]

**Question:**  What conclusion can even a hunter-gatherer society reach regarding miracles?

**Category:** Anthropology

**Answer:** The speaker believes that even a hunter-gatherer society, with its basic understanding of the world, could conclude that miracles like a meteorite strike are evidence of divine intervention.  The speaker argues that a miracle that defies natural laws and probability would point to a power beyond the control of human beings, suggesting a divine force at work.

## 2231.66s:  [Volcanic Eruption and Moses]

**Question:**  What is the speaker's critique of the attempt to connect the Exodus story with a volcanic eruption?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker rejects the attempt to connect the Exodus story with a volcanic eruption, claiming that the connection is faulty and that the volcanic eruption is dated much earlier than the events described in the Exodus account. They argue that this connection is not persuasive and that the volcanic eruption itself doesn't fit the descriptions of the plagues mentioned in the biblical story.

## 2290.74s:  [Geological Dating]

**Question:**  What is the speaker's point about geological dating and its role in the Exodus story?

**Category:** History

**Answer:** The speaker argues that geological dating is a powerful tool for understanding the timeline of events, especially when it comes to volcanic eruptions.  They believe that the volcanic eruption linked to the Exodus story has been accurately dated to a period much earlier than the biblical narrative. This discrepancy challenges the theory that the eruption was responsible for the plagues.

## 2364.06s:  [Volcano Theory]

**Question:** Why does the speaker consider the volcano theory as a possible explanation for the Exodus plagues to be problematic?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker argues that the volcano theory falls apart due to the 100-year difference between geological dating and the biblical timeline.  They believe that geological dating is reliable and irrefutable, based on the evidence of ash deposits and other scientific methods. This discrepancy throws into question the entire volcano explanation for the Exodus plagues.

## 2383.38s:  [Mass Death of Firstborn]

**Question:** What evidence does the speaker cite regarding the death of the firstborn in Egypt?

**Category:** History

**Answer:** The speaker mentions recent archaeological discoveries of mass graves containing primarily young men. These findings, according to the speaker, corroborate the biblical narrative of the death of the firstborn in Egypt. This evidence, combined with other historical and geological details, supports the claim that this event occurred.

## 2421.32s:  [Volcano and Observation]

**Question:**  Could ancient Egyptians have observed a volcanic eruption in Italy or Greece and incorporated it into their religious narratives?

**Category:** History

**Answer:**  The speaker rejects the idea that ancient Egyptians could have observed a volcanic eruption in Italy or Greece and incorporated it into their religious narratives. They point out that the Exodus narrative was written after the events, suggesting that the people later interpreted the volcanic eruption as a miracle associated with Moses.

## 2442.2s:  [Inscriptions and Moses]

**Question:**  What type of evidence would be most compelling to validate the Exodus story?

**Category:** History

**Answer:**  The speaker suggests that finding inscriptions from the time of Moses himself would be the most compelling evidence for the Exodus story.  These inscriptions should be written by contemporaries and not just later interpretations of the event. This evidence would provide direct confirmation of the events described in the Bible.

## 2481.0s:  [Old Testament Versions]

**Question:** What is the speaker's view on the reliability of older versions of the Old Testament?

**Category:** History

**Answer:**  The speaker acknowledges that finding older versions of the Old Testament, such as those possibly buried by Jeremiah, could offer greater historical accuracy. However, they emphasize that even older versions would still be subject to interpretation and potential errors. 

## 2515.619s:  [Prophecy and Trust]

**Question:** Why does the speaker suggest that we can have more trust in a prophet's writings if they are corroborated by other evidence?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker argues that we can have more trust in a prophet's writings if they are supported by other evidence. For example, if we have reason to believe that Jeremiah was a genuine prophet, then his writings, potentially found in a cave, would be more reliable. 

## 2554.079s:  [Prophecy and Historical Analysis]

**Question:**  What is the speaker's point about Jeremiah's writings and their historical context?

**Category:** History

**Answer:** The speaker notes that Jeremiah's writings, while potentially containing prophecies, might also reflect a political and historical context.  They argue that Jeremiah's warnings about the Babylonian invasion and the subsequent captivity of the Israelites could have been deduced from the political situation at the time.  This analysis suggests that not all of Jeremiah's writings need to be considered supernatural prophecies.

## 2590.079s:  [Preservation of Books]

**Question:** What possible motivation does the speaker suggest for Jeremiah's preservation of his writings?

**Category:** History

**Answer:** The speaker offers a possible explanation for why Jeremiah might have preserved his writings.  They argue that Jeremiah, recognizing the political instability of the Israelite kingdom and the threat of Babylonian invasion, might have preserved his writings for future generations, knowing that the Israelites could be taken into captivity. 

## 2625.3s:  [Historical Reports and Miracles]

**Question:**  What does the speaker say about the historical reports of the plagues in Egypt?

**Category:** History

**Answer:** The speaker acknowledges that historical reports and research seem to confirm the events of the plagues in Egypt.  They suggest that the plagues, including famine, locusts, frogs, and blood, actually occurred.  However, they also emphasize that the connection between these plagues and the volcanic eruption is questionable, particularly due to the geological dating that places the eruption much earlier.

## 2671.04s:  [Supernatural Explanation]

**Question:** What is the speaker's conclusion about the explanation for the plagues in Egypt?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker suggests that the plagues in Egypt, if confirmed by historical evidence, could be attributed to a supernatural force.  They believe that a natural explanation like the volcanic eruption is unlikely, leaving a supernatural intervention as the most probable cause. 

## 2681.24s:  [Einstein Condition and Material Miracles]

**Question:**  Why does the speaker say that the "Einstein condition" doesn't apply to material miracles?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker explains that the "Einstein condition," which applies to fulfilled prophecies, doesn't directly apply to material miracles. Material miracles, like those experienced by Moses during the Exodus, leave physical traces and evidence in the world. This evidence can be analyzed and corroborated, making it different from prophecies that rely on predictive power.

## 2703.3s:  [Physical Traces and Miracles]

**Question:**  What kind of physical evidence does the speaker point to as evidence for the Exodus story?

**Category:** History

**Answer:** The speaker refers to the discovery of mass graves containing primarily young men as evidence for the Exodus story.  They argue that these graves, which indicate a mass death of firstborn sons, are significant because they are unlikely to have been caused by war or disease. This evidence, they suggest, points towards a supernatural event that could be connected to the biblical narrative.

## 2714.22s:  [Unconceivable Events and Miracles]

**Question:**  Why does the speaker consider the discovery of mass graves of young men to be an inconceivable event?

**Category:** History

**Answer:**  The speaker believes that the discovery of mass graves of young men is an unusual and improbable event.  They argue that it's unlikely that such a large number of young men would die from war or disease without any other evidence of injury, broken bones, or mixed ages in the graves. This leads them to suggest that a supernatural event might be responsible.

## 2753.94s:  [Firstborn and Volcanic Gas]

**Question:** How does the speaker connect the death of the firstborn in Egypt to the volcano theory?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker attempts to explain the death of the firstborn through the volcano theory by suggesting that the firstborn, who had the privilege of sleeping on beds on the first floor, were exposed to poisonous gases from the volcanic eruption. This theory, according to the speaker, explains why only the firstborn died and not the rest of the family who slept on higher floors. 

## 2784.42s:  [Volcano Theory and Natural Phenomena]

**Question:** What is the speaker's main criticism of the volcano theory?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker argues that the volcano theory fails to account for the historical evidence.

This understanding of the Quran's historical accuracy is crucial for interpreting its messages and understanding its divine origins.

## 2821.319s:  [Roman Victory and Prophecy]

**Question:** What example of a prophecy does the speaker use to demonstrate the Quran's historical accuracy?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker refers to the prophecy in the Quran about the victory of the Romans over the Persians. This prophecy, according to the speaker, was accurate and impossible for anyone to predict at the time, as the Roman Empire was believed to be declining.  This fulfilled prophecy provides evidence for the Quran's divine origin and its accuracy in describing historical events.

## 2892.72s:  [Virgin Birth of Jesus]

**Question:**  How does the speaker approach the story of Jesus's virgin birth?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker addresses the story of Jesus's virgin birth, particularly the part where Mary travels eastwards for seclusion and gives birth. They acknowledge that the story has been filled in with details but focuses on the core elements. The speaker suggests that the story was a private miracle and not publicly known, implying that the detailed stories about Mary's journey and Jesus's birth are likely later interpretations.

## 2950.98s:  [Muhammad's Creativity]

**Question:**  What question arises for those who reject the Quran's story of Jesus's virgin birth?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  Those who reject the Quran's account of Jesus's virgin birth often question why Muhammad would invent such a story.  They claim that the story must have originated from somewhere else.  The speaker argues that this theory doesn't hold up, as there is no evidence of this particular story in other ancient books or apocryphal texts. 

## 2995.859s:  [Muhammad's Genius and Stupidity]

**Question:** What is the speaker's point about Muhammad's intelligence and supposed mistakes?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:**  The speaker argues that it's impossible for Muhammad to be both extremely intelligent and ingenious in some aspects of his story while simultaneously making "stupid" mistakes in other areas. They believe that the claim that Muhammad confused the father of Mary, Imran, with the father of Moses and Aaron is a flawed argument, as it doesn't make sense for someone as intelligent as Muhammad to make such a fundamental error. 

## 3035.04s:  [Virgin Birth and Christian Discourse]

**Question:** How does the speaker approach the Christian debate about the virgin birth?

**Category:** Religion

**Answer:** The speaker mentions that some Christian scholars have criticized the story of the virgin birth, claiming it's a fallacy.

**Category:** Islamic Law

But you cannot simply leave the community and reject its authority.

##  0.16s:  If Allah is the ultimate Sovereign and has ultimate Perfections, how can humans have free will? 
**Category:** Theology 

If Allah is all-powerful and all-knowing, it would seem that our actions are predetermined by Him.  This would mean we don't have free will.  However,  Muslims believe that Allah has given humans free will, and we are accountable for our choices.  This is a fundamental principle of Islam. 

## 7.12s: How can Allah account us for our actions if we don't have free will? 
**Category:**  Theology

If humans don't have genuine free will, then they are not responsible for their actions.  This would mean that holding them accountable for their actions would be unjust.  Muslims believe that Allah is just, so there must be a way for humans to have free will and be accountable for their actions.

## 21.8s: How can we have genuine free will if we don't see it? 
**Category:**  Philosophy

The idea of free will can be difficult to grasp.  If we don't see it directly, how can we be sure that we have it?  The speaker argues that we do have free will, but it may be obscured by our own perceptions or by external forces.   We may be deceived into thinking that we don't have free will. 

## 31.32s: How can our free will synchronize with the Divine knowledge? 
**Category:**  Theology

The question of how free will and divine knowledge can coexist is a complex one.  If Allah knows everything, including our future actions, then doesn't that mean our choices are predetermined?  Muslims believe that Allah's knowledge does not negate our free will.  The exact way they coexist is a matter of ongoing discussion. 

## 43.0s:  If we have genuine free will, how can we be accountable for our actions and punished for them? 
**Category:**  Theology

If we truly have free will, it would seem that we should be able to make choices without fear of punishment.  However, Islam teaches that humans are accountable for their actions and will be judged in the afterlife.  This might seem to contradict the idea of free will, but Muslims believe that Allah is just and that His judgments are based on our choices.

##  Questions Asked and Answered

**0:32.88s**  | **Category:**  Intro 
> What is the format of the session?

The session is a weekly live broadcast featuring a T and Palestine update, followed by a Q&A. 

**0:77.08s** | **Category:** Format
> How will Q&A be conducted?

Q&A is a regular feature, but the first Sunday of every month is dedicated to a longer Q&A session following the Palestine update. 

**1:01.36s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the meaning of the first Ayah of Surah?

The first Ayah of Surah states that Allah's judgment will inevitably come. Some people may misunderstand the language and assume that the Day of Judgment is near, but Isa spoke in parables to prevent this misconception. 

**1:34.68s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What is the meaning of the phrase "God's judgment has come"?

The phrase "God's judgment has come" does not necessarily mean that the Day of Judgment has arrived. Rather, it indicates that all judgments, such as punishments for disbelievers and guidance for believers, are inevitable and will eventually come to pass.

**2:25.52s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What is the general understanding of the phrase "God's judgment is coming"?

The general understanding is that people were expecting Isa to return immediately. This was more of a modern scholar's belief, as they often lack a scriptural background. However, Paul is the only one who believed that the Day of Judgment would occur in his own lifetime, and that belief has been historically proven false.

**2:71.84s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What does the speaker mean by "reusing of the past tense"?

The speaker is referring to the use of the past tense in the Quran to describe events that are actually future events. This is a rhetorical device common in Arabic and other languages, especially in revealed texts. It highlights the certainty and inevitability of future events, even if they are far off.

**3:46.16s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the meaning of the phrase "The judgment of Allah is coming, some people say when is it coming, let it come quickly"?

The phrase highlights the arrogance of those who challenge Allah to bring Judgment soon. Allah will not be rushed. Judgment will come at its appointed time, which may be far in the future. 

**3:85.199s** | **Category:** Surah
> What does the speaker mean by "Allah is almost hiding it"?

The speaker is addressing a verse that states Allah is almost hiding it.  Scholarly interpretation suggests that this means that Allah has not yet made a final decision about when Judgment will come. It is still being postponed, and the decision may be made in the future.

**4:87.0s** | **Category:**  Surah 
> What is the meaning of the phrase "He causes the angels to descend with this divine inspiration bestowed at His behest upon whomever He wills of His servants"?

The phrase refers to the sending down of Revelation, which can be interpreted in different ways, including spiritually and internally. The speaker argues that Revelation is an internal experience that connects people to a higher power, providing a feeling of certainty. 

**5:29.88s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What does the speaker mean by "sending the Angels"? 

The speaker explains that the Angels do not necessarily descend physically. The phrase "sent down" refers to the sending down of Revelation, not necessarily the literal descent of angels.

**6:70.6s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What does the speaker mean by "he created the heavens and the Earth in accordance with His inner truth"?

The speaker explains that the phrase "in accordance with His inner truth" indicates that creation is not arbitrary, but rather structured according to a system of mathematical necessity and proportions. Allah's creation is not magical, but rather based on a certain order and system. 

**7:50.44s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What does the speaker mean by "with the truth"?

**8:53.12s** | **Category:**  Surah
> What is the purpose of creation according to the speaker?

The speaker argues that Allah doesn't need creation for any personal gain or enjoyment.  The most reasonable purpose of creation is to create beings who have free will and mindfulness, so that they can act as finite projections of the Divine. 

**9:35.8s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the meaning of the phrase "He created man out of a mere drop of sperm and lo this same being shows himself endowed with the power to think and to argue"?

The phrase highlights the unexpected potential of humans for both good and evil. Despite their simple origin, humans are capable of great thought and argumentation.  This potential can lead to both good and evil, as some humans will choose to be adversaries to Allah.

**9:71.92s** | **Category:** Surah
> What does the speaker mean by "evident adversary"?

The speaker explains that humans becoming adversaries to Allah is not surprising, as it was always a known and expected possibility.  However, Allah expresses his displeasure with this behavior, as it contradicts the rationality and appreciation for the gifts he has given.

> What does the speaker mean by "cattle you derive warms from them and various other uses and from them you obtain food"?

**11:00.08s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's solution to the problem of evil?

The speaker argues that the problem of evil cannot be solved by attributing creation to a separate entity. Allah is the creator of everything, including the good and the bad. The solution lies in understanding free will and the contingent nature of the universe.  A perfect and flawless creation is not possible, as it would be akin to a Divine being, which is not creatable.

**11:53.68s** | **Category:** Surah
> How does the speaker explain the existence of natural disasters, like tsunamis, in relation to Allah?

The speaker argues that natural disasters are part of the system of the universe.

These natural processes are not "evil," but rather necessary for the development and sustainability of life on Earth. 

**12:48.04s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's argument against attributing suffering and evil to another deity or atheism?

The speaker argues that attributing suffering and evil to another deity is a false solution, as there can only be one necessary existing being. Atheism also doesn't solve the problem, because it removes any agent of free will, leading to the idea of a deterministic universe acting only by necessity. The speaker believes that the universe was created by a being who acts in freedom, and that the problem of evil lies in the inherent contingency of the universe and human free will.

**13:43.84s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's argument against the idea of a blind, dead nature creating the universe?

The speaker argues that the universe cannot have been created by blind nature. The universe has various starting conditions and options, indicating that its creation was not by necessity but by free will. This argument is based on the cosmological proof for the existence of God.

**14:11.92s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's argument against the idea that suffering is the reason some people abandon faith?

The speaker suggests that the argument from suffering is a product of a Christian background, as it stems from the belief that a Divine being who shares substance with his father took human form and suffered for the world. If that is true, then why doesn't this being prevent natural disasters?  The speaker argues that this line of reasoning only serves to further complicate the problem of evil and open the door to atheism, which is not a solution.

**15:20.96s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's argument against the idea of a blind, dead nature being responsible for suffering?

The speaker argues that a blind, dead nature, lacking any purpose, cannot be the source of suffering. Such an entity would only be a grinding machine, lacking any reason or meaning. It cannot explain the existence of suffering or provide a solution to the problem.

**15:49.76s** | **Category:** Surah
> Why does the speaker reject the idea that the universe is created by blind, dead nature?

The speaker rejects the idea of a blind, dead nature creating the universe because it contradicts the idea of a perfect and necessary existing being. A necessary being, by definition, must be perfect and lacking any contingency. The universe, however, is full of contingencies and conditions. 

**15:93.92s** | **Category:** Surah 
> What is the speaker's response to the idea that the heavens were created by God, but the Earth was created by a devil?

> What does the speaker mean by "translated with great hardship"?

> What does the speaker mean by "he will create yet things of which today you have no knowledge"?

The speaker explains that the phrase refers to Allah's ongoing creation. It implies that humans will continue to discover new things and advancements in the future, which are already known to Allah.

> What does the speaker mean by "And he creates what you do not know"?

**24:00.71s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's response to the idea that Allah's creation is based on predetermined fate or fatalism?

The speaker argues against fatalism. He states that Allah shows the right path, but it is up to individuals to choose whether to follow it. The existence of free will implies that individuals have the choice to deviate from the right path. This choice is not against Allah's will or purpose.

**24:96.2s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's explanation of the phrase "it rests with God Alone to show you the right path yet there is many a one who strays from it however had he so willed he would have guided you all"?

**26:00.92s** | **Category:** Surah
> What is the speaker's argument against the idea that rain happens by itself?

##  3:53.08s -  First Translation
**Category:** Quran

And indeed there came unto Abraham our Heavenly Messengers bearing a glad tidding they bade him peace and he answered and upon you be peace and made haste to place before them a roasted C next translation to Abraham our Heavenly Messengers brought good news they said Peace and he answered and upon you be peace without delay he placed a roasted Cal before them.

##  4:06.24s -  Details of the Messengers
**Category:** Quran

Umex s there's no detail about these The Messengers of Allah what they are most like they are angels but as we see be clear from the following story of L they are not human beings and you recognize them and there just some linguistic fine points they said Sal we greet you Sal we say to you peace and he said all peace are on you mean my greeting is Salam and this is linguistically it is it is a nominal sentence in Arabic or a sentence which is how the verb is migrating is is full peace is peace is the full peace so uh so his response is better than their greeting their greeting is good his response is better and higher more comprehensive just linguistic fine point and the second one did not do just read again the AY in Arabic I think said yeah does it say that the last part of the AY.

##  4:48.44s -  The Roasted Calf
**Category:** Quran

Yes without any delay he got a roasted C and another place he went quickly to his to his family to the house and asked him to prepare a roasted okay that's very first next.

##  5:31.32s -  Second Translation
**Category:** Quran

One second translation first translation but when they when he saw their hands when but when he saw that their hands did not reach towards it he deemed their conduct strange and became apprehensive of them but they said fear not behold we are not sent to the people of L lot next translation sorry behold we are sent to the people of lot next translation when he saw that their hands did not reach out towards it he found the strange found the strange and became apprehensive of them they saido not fear we are sent against the people of L lot yeah so that's the other person explain more more details so when he saw that they are not eating they didn't put their hand in the in the in the feast as it should be for guests this is usually usually something to be apprehended of because the tradition in in the area and I think everywhere in the world if you offer food to someone and he sits in your table he's supposed to eat if he doesn't eat meaning he's coming with hostile intent must be something out because they appeared as humans they came to me human shape so if someone refuses to after you have put something on the table to eat with you this is a almost a war declaration a very dangerous sign so he was very apprehensive and obviously that's apparent in his face or he may Express I'm wondering about your behavior are you not guest did I not greet you and invite you and offer you something respectable and they said be afraid we are not humans so we cannot eat obviously we appreciate that you are your your hospitality but we have we are actually angels of your of God and we have we have been sent to the people of L but we are order to make a stop in your place to bring you some extra good news Okay so that's the other place the Quran expanded in points where another place they are summarized and there's a general habit of the Quran the story is never repeated ver word for every every every rep rep soal rep of the story will have additional points or reduced Point summarizing things or explaining things according to the the reason of Revelation and the context and so on so that's what they. 

##  6:88.24s -  Laughing with Happiness
**Category:** Quran

Next and his wife standing nearby laughed with happiness whereupon we gave her the Glad Tiding of the birth of ishak and after ishak of his son Jacob next translation his wife standing nearby laughed with happiness we gave her the good news of the birth of ishak and after ishak of is's son Jacob yeah and there's one notice both of them are fing the say his wife is standing nearby or something no she was standing there standing for what it is the Habit until even the wife of doing that it's the Habit that the landlord when offer get something the wife stand to help and and ser after coming the hij for the that the wife was uded but it was the usual habit of the sahab but since this is does not fit in the in the image of the picture they people have about the sah and the PE of prophets they were they was wondering that the wife of a prophet is standing to serve the guest that's the way it was with the prophets and the way it was with the Muslims at time of except the wife of the Prophet have been excluded specifically because of an incident when we come to we discuss so they could not overcome say standing standing nearby no he's standing on the table who serve the guest and the Quran here summarizes the situation does not me why did she laugh just laughing like that out of nothing no in other places they told Ibrahim that we are going we are not coming to you don't need to be afraid us we are actually send to destroy the people of lot and because she she was very hostile to the people of L she laughed out of happiness that that the people of L are getting at last what they deserve Abrahim was not in that in that League he tried to save the people of Lord show the difference between Sarah and her nature although she's a female should be gentler and Brahim is the utmost smooth and gentle fellow anyway so she laughed based on the Laughing they IMM reive the Revelation that give her the good news that's the good news they will send that she will she will she will uh she will become pregnant and at last after such a long time and almost not almost definitely giving up the Hope because she became an old woman and their husband is an old man possibly impotent sexually inactive no nothing there to hope for they gave her the good news that she will get is and even after is she will get the name is is coming from it is it is just the Laughing one because she laughed so the name was constructed that moment but most likely the the message that she will become pregnant and so and give birth that that was already told to them before they even arrived at at ibraim the Quran said that our messenger came to ibraim with the good news the good news is that already she would be she will having a child and the child even will have another a child coming from him and and the the name was chosen at that moment because she laughed and that Allah revealed to these angels he would be called y he he he laughs the name of is is he laugh that's the transation of the yes if he laugh in the old Hebrew language so next.

##  7:12.88s -  "Alas for me!"
**Category:** Quran

A first translation said she oh who is me shall I bear a child now that I'm an old woman and thus and this husband of mine is an old man verily that would be a strange thing indeed next translation she said alas for me how am I to Bear a child when I'm now an old woman and this husband of mine is an old man this would that would be an astonishing thing so again the Quran summarizes doesn't discuss the reason of here laughing and things like that because that's explained in other places but was immediately in a State of Shock how can an old woman which have menes for decades because according to Old Testament that IIM received the the the the guests much later after is became an old a young man and have started his own family and so on so and even at before the birth of is s has given the hope that she will ever conceive so she gifted Haj the mother of is to ibraim and he had a sh there but after that even ibraim became completely retired he's too old he may have been something like 100 years 100 because he supposed to have under 30 or something years which is the maximum really living time you find in the Old Testament for really historic times leave these imaginary thousand years and so on on this is all imagination they Tred to make it like a like a well established age for the previous generation the time of Noah misunderstanding that Noah stayed 950 years because this was a miracle for him it was not a standard lifespan of humans anyway so she said I can't believe that how can I be pregnant as a very old woman who stopped menes so definitely is no way come and her husband is not capable for anything he's an old man well well advancing age this is really astonishing this is shocking now the Angels answer to her next.

##  8:10.96s -  "Are you astonished?"
**Category:** Quran

First translation answered The Messengers dust thou deem it strange that God should decree what he Wills the grace of God and His blessings be upon you oh people of this house verily verily ever to be praised blim is he next translation they responded are you Aston they The Messengers said are you astonished at God's command May the mercy of God and His blessings be upon you people of this house for he is worthy of all praise and glory yeah San one you should not be astonish about Allah's command or Allah's decision because he has is capable of doing all possible things and this is one of them maybe not physically possible but it is strict and contingent possibility and this is the Divine reach of power and will okay.

##  9:11.96s - Pleading for Lot's People
**Category:** Quran

Next and when they when the fear had left Abraham and the Glad Tiding had been conveyed to him he began to plead for L's L's people next translation when the fear left Abraham and the good news had been conveyed to him he began to plead with us for Lots people yeah so I said in this context there's no no no no intent to show the difference between Sarah and S was vicious to ha and to ibraim conning having a child from the slave she gifted that to him in the hope that she would bring a child anyway there's a huge difference between ibraim gentleness and pleading for the people Lord and Sarah laughing about the destiny because they were coming to we coming to destroy the vi of Lord so was she was jubilant and she was laughing out of Happiness while ibraim was just getting out of the worrying State and receiving this good news about a child to come and then the moment all this situation of suspense is gone he start pleading for the people of law try to delay the punishment or or or or get it cancelled or.

##  9:12.0s -  Devout
**Category:** Quran

Devoted next ay first translation behold Abraham was most Clement most tender-hearted intent upon turning to God again and again next translation Abraham was forbearing tender-hearted and devout yeah give him three attribut forbearing a soft-hearted someone who feels pain in the heart empathy with the other so he start almost having difficulty breathing because of the feeling for the others and he returns to Allah and continuously so this is a very high Praise of.

##  10:13.0s -  Judgment has Passed
**Category:** Quran

Next but God's Messengers replied oh Abraham desist from this pleading Behold thy sustainer judgment has already gone forth and verily there shall fall upon them a chastisement which none can avert next translation God's Messengers replied Abraham stop this pleading your Lord's judgment has already passed punishment is coming to them which cannot be turned back yeah that's very C so that's tell him the decision is already made and made final it cannot no bleeding can delay that.

##  10:33.48s -  A Woeful Day
**Category:** Quran

Next [Music] ay translation and when our Messengers come unto came came unto lot he was sorely grieved by on their account seeing that it was beyond his power to Shield them and he explain this is a woeful day next translation when our Messengers came to lot he was sad for his people seeing that it was beyond his power to protect them and he said this is a truly terrible day yeah so before that in the other place of the Quran in the pleading of irim is that also part of the beinging that lot is living there and they thought him we know who is living there he will be saved except his wife so that's in that context here in this Surah the focus is on the perod of L not on the the pleading the details of the pleading of so the pleading of is much longer than just pleading for the people is TR to give him another chance do this and lot is there what's about there and then after all of that obviously told him you have no more bleeding left stop it will the the punishment is coming there's no way it can be scaped now they when they come toim there's no report how they were looking like like men with beard and so on when they come to L they became hairless clean shaved beautiful young men and the real of L having this what what what should we call it LGBT disease and L knew this will be a major problem now with the people there because they are obsessed with beautiful young boys and these guys look at most likely they took a very beautiful shape very attractive possibly body with curves you can LIF your imagination run and lo say that's the Calamity How can I protect these guys from the people who will definitely either peacefully or by force will rape them that is the difficult yeah.

##  11:42.799s -  "Fear not"
**Category:** Quran

Next [Music] [Music] next and his people came running to him impelled towards his house by their desires by their desire for they had ever want because for they had ever want to commit such Abominations said lo oh my people take these daughters take instead these Daughters of mine they are purer for you for you than men but be then conscious of God and disgrace me not by assaulting my guest is there not among you even one right right-minded man next translation his people came running to him they were accustomed to committing foul Deeds lot said my people take my daughters instead they are purer for you than men fear God and do not disgrace me with my guess then not a single right-minded man among you yeah that's very clear but the scholars have difficulty understanding that L is offering his daughters in instead of these men almost certainly offering them in in wedlock he is my daughter if you have strong sexual desire here is the the natural correct way of fulfilling it almost said in wedlock but anyway this is a minor point this is matter of just argument right to stop them to decrease their their there the fire of gu of gness and on going through them but to no.

##  12:15.559s -  "You know very well what we want"
**Category:** Quran

Avail they answered thou Hast always known that we have no use whatsoever for you for thy daughters and verily well dust thou know what we want they answered you have always known that we have no right to your daughters you know very well what we want okay that's very clear so.

##  12:16.78s -  "I don't have even a corn"
**Category:** Quran

Next [Music] lean to like what they call in Arab Corner because if you're fighting someone then the best protection for you is to lean your back towards a corner so the back is protected the right is protected the left is protected and the enemy isn't is forced to come in the front directly and then you can then work with the sword or the arrow with the with the with the Spears and so what you ever do so the best place to have a protection in Man toan fight is to have your back to a corner so nobody can attack you back and it'll be a corner of walls usually meet almost in in most every con structure almost with a with a with a 90° so you have protection to the right or protection to the left only the front is open and the front you can deal with the sword so say I don't have even a corn that's a metaphoric I don't have one supporting me in this fight and may Allah have mercy on L he was indeed in a very strong Corner which corner he was on the corner of Allah strength of Allah is protecting him but at that moment he was so desperate and so fearful about the situation that he that slipped his mind so may Allah have Mery on he was in a strong corner he had strong protection but he did not visualize it or have it present in his mind at all so then now they respond to him next I show that this this this this this this exclamation is toward the three angel not toward his own people I think in this instance you definitely want to have your back against the wall as well yeah but but in the Arabic to the corner the corner is G better protection than just a wall because the meeting of two walls your back is protected your right is protected your left protected yeah you definitely want to cover your back this okay uh next completely cover and also s at least a good side of the right and good side so the adversary had to come forward maybe a slight but you can manage with the sword or the spear the situation that's in such situation you have the utmost strong situation even if you are like for example kickboxing with some if you are in a corner like that a world Corner then the other guy had to come straight forward maybe the small angle and then you have better opportunity of kicking back intercepting and so on yeah it's not like the Kung Fu films where you get people fighting all sides yeah that's that's it. 

##  13:34.64s - "We are messengers from your lord"
**Category:** Quran

[Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] first translation whereupon the angel said they exp to him yeah no whereupon the angel said oh loot behold we are messengers from thy sustainer never shall th enemies attain to thee depart then with th with thy household while it is yet night and let none of them of you look back and take with thee thy family with the exception of thy wife for behold that which is to Beall these people these people of Sodom shall befall her as well verily their appointed time is the morning and it's and is not the morning day next translation the angel said lot we are messengers from your lord your enemies will never reach you leave with your household in the dead of night and do not look back take all of your family with you with the exception of your wife the Fate which will befall the people of Sodom will befall befall her as well their appointed time is in is the morning is not the morning near yeah so that's that's the the summary of the story obviously another P of Quran shows that they there the people have been they obviously drunk and in an excited state and the angels blind Ed them so they were not able they were touching the walls trying to find the door during that mess lot and family departed maybe from the back door we can imagine that obviously that would not waste time with such small details which you can figure and imagine back door side door fly over it doesn't matter they departed and he told don't look back obviously uh he understood it very so nobody should turn back and see what's happening or maybe it's metaphorically except your wife she will be looking back because she is internally connected with the people she is a traitor and she will be falling with the same Calamity like they will before the people of L their appointment is the morning next morning isn't the morning nearby is near is not there's not very much much time because that whole Affair at the door and so on is going on for for the Quran summarize it in a sentence which take maybe five 5 20 seconds to but it was going be several hours back and forth and there was a movie in which that's depicted and then when most of the night was gone near near the morning then L was was shown by the Angels you don't we are the the messenger of your lord they will never be able to get anywhere just leave with your family with the household and don't turn except your wife you turn to see because she is she want to see what's happenening to them the others no know they trust Allah's punishment is coming and the people will be exterminated so they don't need to turn and reality nobody turn except the wife of L because he will be befen with that them and this will be in the morning isn't the morning nearby it it is now the wife of lot is an example of a a woman betraying there's even some some people speculate that she may be the one who because he when he when the Angels Came he was tending his his his farm outside the city and then when you saw these beautiful young men said we we want to spend the night with you we hear this this place is dangerous and people will be can be intercepted and raided can you give us protection so he got stuck he has to take them said okay so he delayed his going until the night fall so he can sneak in the city so so go some narration and stories and then reaching home safely the wife is the one who communicated with her own people are there look is Haring beautiful young men come enjoy yourself so he's a traitor that's her betrayal most likely and the Quran gives give her and the wife of no as examples for disbelieving disbeliever generally men and women in in the latest Sur of the Quran that Allah give an example for the Believers the wife of no and the wife of L they were married to to two of our rightous servants but they committed treachery they betrayed them some people thought treachery means here something cheating some like husband no that's not it's a streetery and in ideological in belief sense then these two righteous hband could not help them and they both of them were were told would be told or you told already unn their death enter the hell fire with with those who will enter nobody can help you anymore and the example of the believing woman are the wife of Fon and the wife and Mar the mother of Christ these are example the top example in history of believing woman which the Quran give us an example anyway go back here now obviously lot is reled they recognized that these beautiful soft looking almost gayl looking young men are really very tough devastating angels and they will they will annihilate that that place there's no way there's no Escape you see that obviously lot could not was not even in spirit or the mood to appeal or do anything it was just barely hoping to escape next.

##  14:67.36s -  "As though they had never lived there"
**Category:** Quran

[Music] a first translation and when our judgment came to pass we turned those sinful towns upside down and rain down upon them Stone hard blows of Chast ement pre-ordained upon one upon another next translation when our judgment came about we turned those sinful towns upside down and rain down on them stones of hard clay layer after layer which were translation says which were and then um it seems to be linked to the iron next so do you just say both of them no no okay okay okay so it say ends on which were no no which where that's that's maybe explanation what is the layers on layer and okay okay well this this this particular translation only ends here so this is when our judgment came about we turned those sinful towns upside down and rain down on them stones of hard play lay after layer and in bracket switch were so we can we can end there layer after layer okay so that's that's what has happened when in the morning came uh it seems volcanic eruption and in Old Testament ibraim was watching from far because is the high plane and these are in in the deep valley at the end of the Dead Sea in the South End of De sea and recently these these annihilated cities and traces of volcanic eruption and and Volcanic ashes which were at the time somehow mixed with with liquids and that's the reason SC they have been they have been showered down with asphal or zift asphal like like thick uh like what you get from the earth because the people know there was some places where you get petroleum and oil black oil coming from the ground it looks black like like the pavement of the street nowadays but more softer so that's but it was hot and destructive and they were annihilated so places have been found in and but the places not even in time past but the the digging out and archaeology has shown that this place has been destroyed by something like a volcanic eruption something like that at the South tip of the Dead Sea next.

##  14:82.76s -  "Designated by your Lord"
**Category:** Quran

Ayah first first translation marked out in thy sustain sight for the punishment of such as are lost in sin and these blows of God will Doom are never far from evildoer next translation designated by your lord to punish Sinners such punishment is never far from the unjust that's two parts first for that was happen these this punishment is is dedicated and allocated to these special Sinners of L but the Quran make a side kick or side War warning and such a punishment is not far away from the the wicked and unjust one qur listen everyone listens don't think you are far away from punishment any moment such a punishment come before anybody so be alert it's not there no free lunch yeah be alert that can be any any any sinful sinful city or a sinful place especially those who are committing such Grievous crimes like this were committed by the people of rejecting the messenger rejecting Allah's Commandments making Haram Hal that's The Reason by the way just me comment some you find some some symol minded I think of some wab say that that sodomi is an act of no it's not is a sin like any other sin actually is less severe in principle than than for adter and fornication for various reason you can scan the Quran see that but what what is the problem with the PE of lot the problem is that they decided they can Define good and evil and legislate for themselves and declare that to be permissible and nice and they have even adopted that to do it publicly in their Gathering and in their clubbing and so on that's it they they they did not submit to Allah's commands which either commanding something or breing something they made themel leg just Latos and beside our they made themselves the one who Define what's good and bad what is acceptable unacceptable which is a privilege of Allah only and exclusively so that's the CER the CER is really denying rulership of Allah in the story there but also in the Old Testament there's no mention of any Idols nothing it seem to be in the in the formal sense in the technical sense they seem to be non Pagan but they are not monotheist because they attribute to themselves the right of rulership and this is another form of sh which you some people think they were monist but they no it's they were not monist but they were non Pagan they didn't have Idols they have IDE but they made themselves FL beside Allah that's their sh and their and then increased to a level that they even they attacking the the prophet and trying to take the messenger and try to take his guest and uh force them or or use them for for their abomination next.

##  15:25.40s -  Punishment of Sodom
**Category:** Quran

Ayah question you know the the punishment of this is there any kind of implanation as to what the punishment was no there's no nothing some people claim because they have been thrown from up and so on by Allah that's the punishment that's Allah punish any way he likes for for example is that a punishment for a tyrant let him drown no no this is all nonsense Allah in terms of geological form like for example volcano whatever it may be anything we can ascertain in terms of from a geological perspective as to what actually happened an eruption but any that mean I I mean wise to deduce from that that these people will be that people committing something like that and making should be punished by by for example by showered by stones or thrown from my up and followed by Stone like some Scholars Claim Claim by some scholar th there's no no no evidence for that no warranty whatsoever for that especially talking about you need to have absolute goty evidences yeah.

##  15:43.48s -  "They lay lifeless in their homes"
**Category:** Quran

Yeah next ay the story of ended there what happened to him and so on and he joined ibraim again and so on that's all in the Old Testament which is for the score of the quranic message is not very relevant not that much such details are of no relevance in the Quran some details are sometime mentioned to show that what is the in the old scripture and the Old Testament that what is there is maybe fabricated Maybe not correct and to clarify them like for example in the story of sa and and and uh the discussion was the the main focus that the people asked for a king so that they can perform Jihad not because they want Kingdom allegedly that's why they came forward with it and in the discussion of Samuel in the Old Testament Allah Expos them that they don't want Allah to be their King they want they want to they want a king because some of them also buying for them for Kingdom so when tal was was appointed they said how come that he he doesn't have much money and for him wealth is a real and some some of them are quite wealthy and they were thinking they will be kings that but their Hope was dashed and then talut was was appointed because he has strong stronger body and which is suitable for Jihad you claim you want to be fighting behind the king so the king who is Cable Jihad and fight will be prepared secondly he he has more knowledge he a knowledgeable man and that's needed for leadership and so so they were shut up but but interesting the Quran mentioned that when we when he separated with the believer him he told them that Allah will test you with a river you should not drink from it he want to test their their their commitment and the Str except just take one handful just to extinguish you that that's all just and then many of them they drank so he tell them you go back you are not you are not disciplined you are not worthy ofing the but that story is not in the book of samel attributed to toal it's actually attributed to J in the Book of Judges so conclusion why the mission this this this test it's relatively a minor isue yes it is shows that's important to to have people going to the battlefield who are really committed and though who's not committed should be sent back you not join not joining me there's no no obligatory DFT in Islam not even previous besid it's counterproductive you don't if you get people in the battlefield who are not devoted and committed yeah it is you have the precondition of losing and people running away doesn't work this way especially if you are fighting for the cause of Allah you have to Beed to the cause not for or something that but why mention such such a special episode to show that the story The Testament that is lacking in it must be must have been removed there and either attributed to J or it may have been he is following the example of J J had a such occasion and he tested the people the same way so he repeat the same test so the one for J does be rejected as not happening it may happen but he applied the same thing to test the people but that has been red why because the writing of the Old Testament is is obviously written mostly by the party of who claim to be anti and they we two two parties and also the descant of talut they claim to have the are the legitimate King and they took the Northern State Israel while the descendant of of D took theia capital city of of Jerusalem where the nor State the capital city was jerim or something near near na C naus so you can expect with such a long history of hostility and partisanship that this the people will be Tumbling With the scripture according to their desire but this that we conclude now but the mere fact that it is not there is clearly that this had been removed it's an important aspect and also the fact that that one of sign that the tabut the Ark of the Covenant will be brought back carried by the Angels now carrying with the angels in the in the book of samel it claims that the Ark of Covenant was put on on a on a on a carriage P by two by two two oxen and for some unexplained reason the the the people of go push them to them without any fight how can it happen that they put it and send it and P on a carriage by by two oxen well the Quran says clearly it's carried by the Angels if it's carried by the Angels most likely it come flying in the sky so you can see it would be an ay clear evidence
