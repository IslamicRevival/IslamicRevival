* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgkJ_hmu8ZE&t=300)* Discusses how Echo Chambers can result in biased viewpoints, and how Adventure Podcast tried to drown him with sound bites. He goes on to say that his main audience has always been Muslims, and that both the left wing and right wing are hypocrites in essence.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgkJ_hmu8ZE&t=600)** The YouTube user discusses how he believes that Qatar should host the World Cup because it is in line with Islamic values. He also discusses how many non-Muslims are receptive to the idea of LGBTQ+ rights, and how the promotion of Islam and Muslim times is a logical entailment of LGBTQ+ rights.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgkJ_hmu8ZE&t=900)* Discusses the controversy over whether Qatar should host the World Cup, focusing on the idea that Qatari authorities should be consistent in their treatment of LGBT people. He points out that this is a disagreement based on different perspectives on how to live according to Islamic law, and that there are serious implications for people who disagree with the host country's stance on LGBT rights.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgkJ_hmu8ZE&t=1200)**  Abdullah Al Andalusi discusses the pros and cons of Qatar hosting the World Cup. He argues that, if any country is allowed to host the tournament, Qatar should be allowed to do so because it has not engaged in any atrocities compared to other countries that have hosted the World Cup. Jake asks Abdullah the same question and agrees, citing Islamic principles.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgkJ_hmu8ZE&t=1500)** argues that Qatar should not host the World Cup because it is not in line with Islamic principles.

[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=46) discussion about Qatar and we have with

[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=71) bit late as we all are a little bit uh  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=74) but yeah so today's show is going to be  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=76) about the whole discussion around Qatar  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=79) the World Cup I think it's uh almost  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=83) unavoidable as to the type of  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=85) discussions that have been taking place  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=86) I think probably in the last week or so  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=89) it's probably calmed down a little bit  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=92) um in terms of the whole vitriol against  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=94) Carter but there are some really  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=96) interesting discussions that have taken  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=98) place and you know the issue around uh  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=102) the whole agenda behind the accusations  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=106) against Qatar the lgbtqi issues how  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=111) Muslims should respond to it uh the  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=113) whole women's rights issue migrant  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=116) workers uh whether it's a waste of money  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=119) harmful to the environment there's lots  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=122) of discussions to be had as well as fact  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=125) that we have the issue around the  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=126) hypocrisy of the West as well in terms  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=129) of uh why why they've got this  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=131) particular agenda against Qatar that  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=133) we've never seen regardless of any other  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=135) Nation before that have hosted the World  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=137) Cup or the Olympics and we've got  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=139) brother Abdullah and Abdullah he was on  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=142) a show recently and I'm sure many of the  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=144) viewers have seen the show or come  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=146) across at least some of the links of the  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=148) show  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=149) um the show was a round table debate  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=151) discussion where Robert Abdullah had to  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=153) debate discuss would pretty much the  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=157) four people is it four people as well as  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=159) yourself so there's five altogether was  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=160) there  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=164) your mute  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=166) I'd like to say um it was uh three  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=169) guests and a moderator but it seemed  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=171) like it was just four guests um and me  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=173) that's the fifth guest  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=176) yeah yeah so yeah so obviously that's a  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=178) really difficult situation now Abdullah  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=181) I'm gonna ask a quick question on that  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=182) on that show some people have said that  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=186) really you shouldn't have gone on that  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=187) show because it was so much biased  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=191) uh you know it's all weighted against  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=193) you it's not like you've got two people  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=195) in support of your position and two  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=197) people against them a neutral moderator  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=199) but so what would you say about those  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=202) people who say no provision go on such a  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=205) unbalanced show  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=207) well I'd say then um then you you'd  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=210) never get any Muslim going on any  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=211) Western media platform uh to challenge  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=213) them because they're not going to have a  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=216) fair debate on their platform every  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=218) platform right wing or left wing the  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=220) show in particular was left wing uh but  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=222) but the day before I was on a right-wing  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=224) program and as soon as I mentioned uh I  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=226) think it was uh talk TV and as soon as I  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=228) mentioned for example Israel's racist  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=230) policies  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=231) um they then shot they literally shut  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=233) down the discussion they just said okay  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=234) that's it that's it enough of this and  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=236) uh and so on so uh having been on both  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=239) right-wing platforms and left-wing  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=241) platforms I can tell you that they don't  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=244) aspire to present a a fair debate or  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=247) discussion in for the most most part  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=250) um so if any Muslim wishes to get the  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=253) message out or outside of the Muslim  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=256) Echo chamber then you're going to go  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=258) down on their platforms for the most  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=259) part when it comes to TV media when it  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=262) comes to public debates uh which we you  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=265) can organize or which occur in the  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=267) Oxford Union  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=268) um or Cambridge Union at the those  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=270) respective universities then they they  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=272) they can be fair at times sometimes  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=276) they're also not not fair at all because  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=278) uh you have people on your side which  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=280) are not necessarily on your side or  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=281) they'll be disagreeing but but in  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=283) principle that meant to be there's going  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=284) to be two sides to a proposition but  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=286) um if you notice that people that public  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=288) debates don't really get much attention  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=290) uh amongst the mass populace right no  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=293) one says hey it's a Friday night let's  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=295) put on the on a debate to watch no one  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=297) does that generally speaking it's niche  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=300) in the west usually for only some  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=302) intellectuals and even then many Western  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=303) intellectuals don't uh would look at  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=306) maybe presidential debates or again they  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=308) only look at debates on their own  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=309) platforms on left-wing platforms or  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=311) right-wing platform so all these Echo  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=313) Chambers are occurring and so if you  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=316) really want to avoid  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=317) um being able to challenge them then  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=320) sure you know say no to them but if you  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=322) if we if we are to challenge them and  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=325) inshallah show the world their hypocrisy  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=327) then you're gonna have to expect unfair  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=331) uh kind of an unfair setup I'm sure the  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=334) Muslims at the Battle of Badr didn't say  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=337) you know what let's walk away because  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=338) it's three versus one it's not fair okay  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=341) uh sometimes you have to challenge  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=342) unfair circumstances I'm not comparing  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=345) the debates to to battles by the way but  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=348) I'm just seeing the principle is that we  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=350) live in a world which will be unfair  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=352) again or weighted against many times the  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=354) truth and we just have to  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=357) um we have to kind of deal with that and  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=359) approach that kind of without  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=362) reservation  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=365) there's a there's a point that somebody  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=367) raised actually uh or questioned so I  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=370) thought I'd ask it now uh so uh he said  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=373) thought Adventure podcast they tried to  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=375) drown they tried drowning brother  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=378) andalusi's under sound bites so just on  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=381) that point our implementary loaded  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=384) questions so one thing I know is that  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=385) that Miriam namazi who's a well-known  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=388) ex-muslim Iranian atheist uh you know  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=392) huge guy say oh you know you calling for  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=395) stolen people to death you call it  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=397) bestowing people to death I'm just not  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=398) going to get engaged in this now you  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=400) know so it's quite I think that's pretty  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=402) obvious that was that was uh you know  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=405) that was the intended  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=406) um any agenda but then Sam goes on to  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=410) say I admire The Bravery but what does  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=411) the average non-muslim take home from  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=413) the debates I don't know if you've got  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=414) any examples of any non-muslims or  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=417) you know any feedback that you got from  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=420) that  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=426) so Abdullah your mic's off  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=429) sorry sorry about that yeah I'm still  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=431) getting used to this ring I've got  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=433) um so so basically  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=435) whenever you go onto these Echo Chambers  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=437) right wing or left wing they're going to  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=439) be watched by right-wing followers and  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=440) be watched by left-wing followers um  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=443) dogmatic devotees to their various  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=445) doctrines most of them I don't care  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=447) whatever you say you know uh the  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=450) everyone could be all the left wing or  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=452) the right wing people could have been  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=453) silent on these platforms and only the  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=455) Muslim speaking and yet a right winger  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=457) or a left-winger from amongst  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=458) non-muslims would would turn around and  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=460) say our side one regardless  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=462) um but what you do get is you get a  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=465) minority of P of most non-muslims who  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=468) say actually you know what I think the  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=470) Muslim had a point if you look at the  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=472) comment sections in on on tick tock on  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=477) YouTube for a lot of these very  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=479) controversial uh you could say kind of  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=482) TV programs I've entered into where it's  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=484) basically obviously slanted against the  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=485) Muslim  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=486) you'll find non-muslims say I'm a  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=488) Christian uh some even say I don't  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=490) believe in religion but I think the  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=492) Muslim guy had a point about this or and  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=494) or they noticed that that's kind of  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=496) unfair what they did  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=497) um to the Muslim God the moderator  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=499) actually started to also attack the  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=501) non-muslim guy that's not really  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=502) professional uh some people say you know  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=505) I've just given up I used to be a  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=507) follower of this TV channel I'm gonna  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=508) I'm going to quit it so you you get this  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=510) quite a lot actually  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=512) um I mean not the majority of people  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=513) watching it but you do get a minority of  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=516) non-muslims watching it so that kind of  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=518) chinks away at the armor because all  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=520) that's all you can ever do really the  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=522) the dogmatic Fanatics of the right wing  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=524) and left wing will never be convinced so  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=526) easily uh and they they look for just  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=530) reaffirmation if you even look at these  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=533) programs these are Echo chamber programs  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=535) uh which are actually they go to the  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=537) extreme entertaining the the most  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=539) bizarre theories or or conspiracy  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=542) theories of both right-wing and  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=543) left-wing  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=544) um sides  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=545) um so it's not it's going to be an echo  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=547) chamber so anyway I ask anyone to look  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=551) at the comment sections  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=552) uh both on Twitter on YouTube and so on  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=556) so forth and you'll see non-muslims  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=558) um actually  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=559) kind of pointing out ways they can do  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=561) but I think the Muslim guy had a point  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=562) about this and that's really why I go on  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=565) these programs uh to do but that's  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=567) actually in a way not even the main  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=569) objective the main objective my main  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=571) audience has always been actually  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=572) Muslims  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=574) um I wanted to point out to Muslims that  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=576) both the left wing and right-wing are  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=578) are hypocrites in essence they both  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=581) don't accept Islam or Muslims um for for  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=584) what they are and by not accept I don't  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=585) mean they don't because they don't  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=586) embrace it I mean they are intolerant  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=589) against Muslims and against Islam when  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=592) it's presented the left wing pretend to  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=594) protect us but that's only if there's  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=596) only our identity as a Muslim not the  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=598) content of that of that word they don't  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=601) agree with it and then they do more than  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=603) not agree with it they move to be  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=605) intolerant against it so the the the  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=608) main my main audience is Muslims and  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=610) also to show Muslims how vacuous and  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=613) empty the West is of any intellectual  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=616) justifications for their ideas and the  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=618) Very fact for example in that event I  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=620) attended when I kept challenging them I  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=622) said please provide me a justification  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=624) for any of this you say it's Universal  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=626) human rights okay then show me how from  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=628) first principles it is universal rather  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=632) than just dictate Western dictate like  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=633) we say this is a right now it's a right  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=635) so my main audience has always been  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=638) Muslims because many Muslims look to the  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=640) West they look to  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=642) um uh some look to left wing some even  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=644) look to right wing and they they say oh  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=647) we can adopt this we can uh we can get  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=649) behind them we can Ally with them and  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=651) they say they're not your allies they're  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=652) not your friends right as the Quran kind  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=655) of warns us about that you know do not  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=656) take them for allies in essence as a  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=658) general warning why because they only  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=661) really allies for themselves amongst  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=663) themselves to those who believe with  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=665) them or agree with them so that was the  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=667) basic point to expose them to the Muslim  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=670) World primarily to show their emptiness  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=673) their their vacuity uh the the great  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=676) Lacuna the middle of their doctrines  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=679) but which is empty of any kind of  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=681) justification and yet they propound  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=683) universality so that's what was the the  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=685) main objective of that  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=688) no alhamdulillah I think uh generally uh  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=691) for a lot of Muslims I think there was  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=692) generally positivity around it I think  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=694) the only concern that maybe had people  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=696) had was the fact that how effective  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=698) could you reach out in these types of  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=701) debates outside of the Muslims amongst  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=703) the non-muslims uh when you know you had  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=706) so many people but you know I think one  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=708) thing that I've noticed certainly now in  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=711) recent last couple of years or so maybe  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=712) even less than that last year or so uh  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=715) especially over social media is the fact  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=717) that there is a large rejection that's  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=719) occurring now against Western liberal  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=721) and what I mean by Western I'm talking  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=723) about leftist type values and you know  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=726) we had Jordan Peterson on the one hand  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=728) and now you've got Andrew take who's  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=729) also become a Muslim uh who are sort of  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=732) railing against sort of these very  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=734) liberal feminist ideas that are coming  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=736) out lgbtqi and so it's now and and also  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=742) that with Andrew in particular and his  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=744) popularity is really pushing this idea  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=747) that only Islam and Muslim times uh the  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=749) only sort of people that are principled  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=752) enough to stand up against it and you  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=754) know what's interesting is that you know  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=756) when I talk to non-muslims whether it's  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=758) at work or just you know generally uh in  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=761) private conversations and stuff what you  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=764) find is that when you speak about this  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=766) issue of lgbtqi the initial natural  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=769) reaction is to say yeah what's wrong  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=771) with it so long as it makes them happy  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=772) and then you say yeah but think about it  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=775) you know do you think it's okay for a  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=777) five-year-old or a six-year-old to  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=778) undergo you know hormonal blockers or  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=781) you know a boy being dressed up as a  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=783) girl I've been told you're going to be  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=785) called she you know you should die is  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=787) that all right and they think about it  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=789) and within a very short period of time  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=790) they become quite you know antagonistic  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=793) against the whole idea not just  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=794) transgender amongst children but the  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=797) whole idea and so I think they've gone  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=801) so far  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=803) in terms of pushing their agenda that  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=805) it's got to a point where people finding  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=807) it completely ridiculous but and I think  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=810) this is the key thing is what we have to  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=813) show is this is The Logical entailment  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=816) of their ideology you are free to do  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=819) whatever you want yeah I don't know what  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=821) your thoughts are regardless of that  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=825) so your mic Abdullah sorry  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=828) that'll be the last time I promise um  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=830) yeah so I I no doubt the uh the people  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=834) in the in the TV channel wanted to have  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=836) a mute button for me during during that  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=839) but uh anyway so  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=843) uh yeah yeah so so you know um you know  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=845) I I concurred that in essence  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=848) um when engaging these topics  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=850) um the the the the west or the average  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=854) Westerner has a lot of assumptions about  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=855) what is good and bad and uh they see  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=858) anyone who disagrees with them as being  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=860) unreasonable so they so they say oh  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=861) we're Live and Let Live unless you  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=865) critically disagree with the foundations  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=868) of their beliefs and then they have  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=869) issues because  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=871) they used to say 100 years ago 100 years  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=874) ago let's just say uh 50 60 years ago  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=876) there was a campaign  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=879) to make uh you know LGBT or at least the  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=882) the kind of  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=883) um homosexuality for before the  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=885) transsexual Decay to make it acceptable  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=888) not discriminated against uh not banned  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=891) right in many many countries so once  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=893) they kind of overcome that and they they  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=895) made promises they said look you know  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=897) people let people sleep with who they  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=899) want to sleep with it's not going to  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=901) affect you it's not going to affect your  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=903) kids it's gonna be  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=905) um you know as long as you don't have to  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=906) do it as long as you don't physically  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=909) attack those people or you don't stop  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=910) them from getting jobs but that's it  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=912) that's all we we ask I said Okay that  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=915) was conceded then by by the right in a  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=917) way but then it moved on to the next um  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=920) kind of uh phase which is if you express  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=924) an unpopular opinion about  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=926) um which now is unpopular if you express  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=928) an opinion about LGBT that you think is  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=930) morally wrong  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=932) for people to engage in same-sex  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=934) relationships your expression of this is  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=937) an act of intolerance and of course we  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=940) must be intolerant against intolerance  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=942) and therefore you must suffer  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=945) consequences because why do you have to  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=947) go around saying it's morally wrong yeah  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=949) why can't you just let them do what they  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=951) do say well I'm not physically stopping  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=952) anybody I'm just expressing that it's  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=955) you know be morally wrong and they'll  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=956) say oh no but that expression itself is  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=960) an oppression against them in society or  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=963) creating a you know a a social a  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=965) socially  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=967) um unwelcoming environment for them by  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=970) raising this or making this point so  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=972) then so then it creeped further and  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=974) further and now  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=976) in schools they say well the schools  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=978) have to be equal they have to be about  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=981) equality the school can't represent any  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=983) particular Viewpoint and so in the name  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=986) of equality when we teach kids about sex  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=990) education first they say that sex  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=992) education is mandatory because children  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=993) need to know about sex and the  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=995) government needs to ensure that children  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=997) have enough knowledge about sex such  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=999) that they don't make mistakes when they  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1001) are children and when they become 16 or  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1003) 18 or whatever age it is they can then  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1005) make informed decisions and we can't  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1007) leave that to their parents because we  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1008) need to guarantee that that this is done  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1010) properly so that we'll take control of  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1012) this government says okay doesn't sound  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1014) so bad until you mix the equality idea  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1018) with that and then the government has to  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1021) teach in schools not without privilege  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1024) or favor to any particular sexuality so  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1028) then they have to teach the kids that  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1029) all sexualities are equally valid  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1032) right in the name of equality and  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1034) they'll have to teach all the kids about  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1036) all kinds because they can't they can't  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1037) presume which kid has which sexuality  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1039) and so they'll just teach them but  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1041) they're all valid  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1043) you see and that's what it's got to  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1045) today so it started out Simply as uh  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1048) don't attack uh you know uh don't ban a  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1052) gay marriage don't ban homosexuality we  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1055) won't bother you just just allow these  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1058) these people to engage in those in those  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1060) sexualities and don't discriminate  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1062) against them for going to shops or  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1064) getting a job uh they won't bother you  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1066) and now  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1068) it's they're coming after our children  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1070) to teach them  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1071) moral positions on sexuality they say  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1075) that all these sexualities are  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1078) um are equally valid because they can't  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1080) tell the kids that one is invalid or  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1083) more valid so they have to say in the  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1085) name of equality they're all valid now  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1087) so this is where we're at this is the  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1089) stage now that everyone has to now  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1091) justify LGBT Pride marches and put the  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1094) the rainbow Flags because if you don't  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1096) then then why not are you saying that  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1100) they are uh it's a morally uh invalid uh  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1104) sexuality or or or kind of life  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1106) lifestyle whatever and then and then you  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1110) will be you know uh socially prosecuted  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1113) in a way even if not legally prosecuted  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1115) but you'll be socially prosecuted of  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1117) course yeah  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1118) people will lose their jobs people can  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1121) be you know lose uh their YouTube  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1124) channels they can lose Twitter accounts  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1127) they can even have their bank accounts  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1129) put on hold so it's not just a very  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1131) simple  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1132) you know um you know it's not just the  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1134) fact that people have you know concerned  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1136) looks at you and maybe not invite you to  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1138) the office party or whatever it is yeah  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1140) uh there's serious ramifications on  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1143) people  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1144) um and obviously there could be even  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1146) legal issues of people as well so just  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1149) on the issue of cartoon now uh obviously  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1152) that's a bit of a preamble but uh I  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1155) wanna yes or no Abdullah should cut her  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1158) have held the World Cup yes or no  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1163) well as I said on the show  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1166) um you know how do you debate  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1168) non-muslims who don't have the same  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1170) criteria of good and bad that we do  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1172) and you know the the Quran gives us a  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1175) great guidance it says do not dispute  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1176) the people the book unless you witnessed  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1178) them committing Injustice now what would  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1181) be on in just because not ruling by the  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1184) the the Sharia would be Injustice for  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1186) our perspective and they don't believe  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1188) in in Islamic law and so on so forth so  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1191) how do we so so where is this dispute  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1193) coming from then uh well it's because of  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1196) um consistency we can hold them to being  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1198) consistent if they believe in certain  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1200) principles then they have the ability  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1202) just so I know you're gonna but do you  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1205) think Qatar should have held the World  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1206) Cup or not  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1208) well if any country is allowed to hold  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1210) the World Cup regardless of their human  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1212) rights records or what have you that  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1214) every country should be allowed to hold  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1215) the World Cup regardless of their  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1217) whatever whatever human human rights  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1220) records uh according to the West because  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1222) because the West breaks their own their  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1224) own criteria of whatever human rights is  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1226) and of course human rights is Western  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1227) the Western ideas of Human Rights not  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1230) the universal ideas of Human Rights  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1240) good to see you Beth  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1245) you seem to sort of not answer the  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1248) question though that okay fine if  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1249) everybody if if if human rights are not  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1252) an issue then everybody should be  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1254) allowed to have it but you think culture  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1257) should have been allowed to have the  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1258) World Cup  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1262) but why is my opinion relevant I'm just  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1264) joking with you  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1267) that's what that's what the uh the the  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1269) people in the in the panel were trying  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1271) to say like answer the question answer  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1272) the question so okay anyway I'm just  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1275) trolling you brother okay um so so  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1277) basically as I said from the basis of of  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1279) being consistent that if any country is  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1281) allowed to have hold the World Cup  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1283) regardless of whatever they do bombing  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1286) um and killing thousands and millions of  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1287) people around the world like American  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1288) England does no one complain about about  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1291) them hosting the World Cup even though  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1292) they've killed far more human beings on  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1294) planet Earth than Qatar never has yeah  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1296) then I say that from that basis then  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1298) then Qatar shouldn't be allowed to hold  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1301) the World Cup if uh within the same  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1303) rules that everyone else uh is following  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1306) or or not following so in essence there  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1309) should be one consistent criteria then  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1311) that that should be followed by FIFA  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1313) that should apply to all countries  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1314) because if if FIFA said that we will  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1317) hold the World Cup in China and there's  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1318) no problem we'll hold the World Cup in  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1320) Russia we hold the World Cup in America  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1321) or England and then they say oh no but  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1324) not Qatar uh because we don't like what  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1327) they're doing to  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1328) um we don't like their stance on Banning  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1330) sodomy basically then I'd say well you  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1334) excuse genocide of Muslims but when it  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1336) comes to sort of mean you have an issue  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1338) of That So based on that on that issue I  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1340) say that yeah Qatar should be allowed to  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1343) um hold the World Cup if consistency is  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1345) what we are seeking  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1347) my position is very clear I think Qatar  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1350) shouldn't be allowed to hold the World  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1351) Cup but I'll maybe explain that later on  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1353) I want to bring in Jake here uh so Jake  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1356) what are we've we were just talking  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1358) briefly before uh about uh abdullah's  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1361) interview that he had or the discussion  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1363) they had regardless of that so I'm gonna  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1366) ask the same question to you uh Jacob do  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1368) you think Qatar should be allowed to it  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1370) should have no should be allowed to  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1372) should have held the World Cup  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1375) yeah I mean I think I would give a  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1378) similar answer that uh Abdullah gave  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1380) which is to say that if these other  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1383) countries are uh allowed to host the  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1386) World Cup then I don't see any reason  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1388) why uh Qatar would be any different  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1391) um and if you're going to exclude for  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1394) certain reasons  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1396) um especially if you're going to talk  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1397) about the uh the acts against humanity  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1401) that these other countries have engaged  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1404) in then  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1405) um then both of them should not hold the  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1408) World Cup if that's if that's the way  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1409) you want to see it but there's really no  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1411) comparison uh between what Qatar has  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1414) done or supposedly is done compared to  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1416) these other Western countries like  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1418) England and  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1420) um you know we can go through through  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1422) the list so I just see it as  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1425) um complete hypocrisy on the on the part  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1428) of the West in trying to exclude certain  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1431) Muslim nations  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1433) um for for holding these events but yet  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1435) nobody has a problem with these Western  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1438) countries and even Russia and China to a  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1442) certain extent for for hosting and the  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1444) same level of outrage even if there is  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1446) any is is nowhere near when a country  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1449) like uh Cutler host is uh hosts the  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1451) event so I mean I think the problem is  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1454) just that the complete hypocrisy in the  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1458) west especially in the media and I think  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1460) that uh Abdullah did a good job of sort  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1463) of highlighting that in um in that  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1465) discussion uh because I watched it by  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1467) the way and I did think it was I did  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1469) think it was beneficial although it  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1471) almost became like three and four on one  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1474) at certain times  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1476) um but yeah so that that's what I would  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1479) say from the outset  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1481) um I I know what uh Sheriff's gonna say  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1484) um and I'll you asked me for the Islamic  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1486) perspective whereas I was just arguing  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1489) against you could say the non-muslims um  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1491) uh kind of angle where they would say  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1494) well why can't why should we have Qatar  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1496) hosting the World Cup and I said well  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1498) look from Islamic perspective I'd be  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1500) very clear on this  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1501) um the the World Cup is a celebration of  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1504) Australia it's about it's it's uh  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1506) defined by what we call nationalism or  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1508) tribalism or groupism other than the  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1511) Islamic Paradigm of the ummah which is  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1513) which is transnational it's it's it  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1515) transcends the national transcends the  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1517) tribal so  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1519) um on that basis I would say and I've  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1521) always said that um such International  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1524) tournaments Muslims uh Muslims shouldn't  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1527) even be divided by Nations let alone  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1530) uh participating in a in a sporting  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1533) event that kind of reifies and  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1536) um solidifies uh the nation-state model  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1539) in a sense so that would be in a way my  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1543) kind of um uh the the my perspective  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1546) from the Islamic angle you could say but  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1549) when responding to non-muslims I would  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1551) say that they don't have a reason to  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1553) deny Qatar from their own kind of  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1555) criteria  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1558) yeah no I agree and I think that's the  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1561) reason why I think  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1563) from my perspective shouldn't have  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1565) hosted the World Cup not because  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1567) necessarily of  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1570) um you know uh other reasons that the  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/NgkJ_hmu8ZE?t=1573) West have been claiming but primary
