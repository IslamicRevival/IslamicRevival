## Description

Often we hear people saying that Islam’s position is incoherent or illogical. Or that they’ll claim that God is impossible. Similarly some will appeal to mystery when presented with a clear logical contradiction and so it becomes important to actually explain what is considered a logical impossibility. Without clearly knowing what is or isn’t a logical impossibility one cannot formulate a proper argument and on what principle they are appealing to.

## Summary of [What's Logic Got To Do With It? - How to spot logical contradictions | Thought Adventure Podcast #15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno)


*<span style="color:red; font-size:125%">This summary is AI generated - there may be inaccuracies</span>. [](/)*

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=3600)

 discusses how to identify a logical contradiction and provides an example. It also explains how a concept can be true but still be incoherent.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=0)**  Jake and Joseph discuss why logic is important, and how it can be helpful in discussions. They also discuss how Abdullah, a guest on the show, is related to the discussion.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=300)** Logic is important for making good arguments and recognizing bad arguments.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=600)**  Jake and Yusuf discuss how people reason, and how a valid argument is one in which the conclusion follows from the premises. They also talk about how children reason, and how to incentivize them to be honest.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=900)* Discusses the three main propositions that humans use to reason: logical possibility, logical impossibility, and mathematical truths. Propositions are truths that can be true or false, and can be either logically possible or logically impossible.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=1200)** Logical impossibility is a contradiction within a sentence or proposition that has no meaning. Practically speaking, this means that someone is talking nonsense.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=1500)**  the Thought Adventure Podcast discusses contradictions and how they can be identified. The host points out that a contradiction is not simply a statement that is strange or contradictory, but one that can be derived from a series of other statements. For example, the statement "This is made of metal" can be a contradiction because it conflicts with the statement "This does not contain metal."
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=1800)**  Jake talks about the concept of logical impossibility, which is when a statement carries no value of meaning. He explains that when people use the word "illogical," they are being inaccurate. He goes on to say that when two propositions carry no meaning, they result in a statement that is meaningless to humans.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=2100)**  explains how to spot a logical contradiction, and provides an example of how affirming the consequence can lead to a fallacy.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=2400)** In this example, Mr. Pine Creek argues that because there is evil in the world, it is not an ideal world created by God. However, this contradicts his earlier statement that this world is "the best of all."
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=2700)** , Abdul Rahmani argues that there is a contradiction in the idea that God allows sin, because if God doesn't like sin, then people who sin will go to Hell. However, Rahami points out that this is not a contradiction, because if you affirm both concepts simultaneously, then there cannot be a contradiction.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=3000)**  Jake and Sharif discuss how a concept can be coherent yet still be unreasonable or implausible. They also discuss how a concept can be true but still be incoherent.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=3300)** , Sharif discusses how a contradiction can exist when someone tries to argue that there is a contradiction between the idea that there is a god and the idea that humans have free will. He argues that there is no contradiction because the two ideas are not in the same sense. He then goes on to say that some Muslims who are unsure about whether or not to believe in a god will hear what is being discussed and may become convinced that there is no god.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=7200)

, "What's Logic Got To Do With It? - How to spot logical contradictions," philosopher Jake Knoll explains that the concept of libertarian free will is contradictory, because the main thing that needs to exist in order to have free will is a reason for what a person chooses, but that reason does not necessitate that the choice be made. If this is the case, then it would be impossible for an agent to be morally accountable for their actions, as there would be no explanation as to why they acted in a particular way.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=3600)**  Thought Adventure Podcast host Sharif Ahmed discusses a contradiction in the Islamic belief system of God wanting all people to be saved, but also wanting some people to go to Hell. Ahmed points out that this contradiction is not a logical contradiction, and instead is a logical deduction of the premises. He then goes on to argue that this contradiction is an inherent part of the Islamic belief system, and that it negates the belief in God.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=3900)**  three atheists discuss how a contradiction is incoherent. Each atheist argues that the contradiction is incoherent, but each provides a different justification for their argument. The third atheist points out that the contradiction is actually intentional, and the speaker agrees that this is probably the case.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=4200)**  Abdullah explains that to make a positive claim that something does not exist, one must provide evidence that does not exist. Sharif asks Abdullah if it is possible for God to exist, and Abdullah responds that it is not possible for God to exist because if God existed, we would see evidence of His existence. Raw asks Abdullah if it is possible for God to help someone in a matter, and Abdullah responds that it is not possible for God to help someone in a matter unless God manipulated other people's minds and controlled their free will.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=4500)**  Sharif Abdul argues that there is a contradiction in the belief that God exists, because it doesn't follow from the existence of God that humans have free will. He also argues that there is an internal contradiction in Islam, because the free will libertarian position implies that humans have ultimate control over their choices, which is not consistent with the Islamic view of human nature.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=4800)* Discusses how logic cannot be used to determine if something is morally accountable, and provides an explanation for why this is the case. It argues that free will is not an incoherent concept, and that holding individuals morally accountable requires accepting that they are truly free.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=5100)* Discusses two objections to libertarian free will: that it applies only to human beings and that it is arbitrary. The presenter responds to each objection by explaining why it is flawed. He then argues that, even if free will is arbitrary, it still has reasons behind the choices it makes.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=5400)** , "What's Logic Got To Do With It? - How to spot logical contradictions," philosopher Jake Knoll explains that the concept of libertarian free will is contradictory, because the main thing that needs to exist in order to have free will is a reason for what a person chooses, but that reason does not necessitate that the choice be made. If this is the case, then it would be impossible for an agent to be morally accountable for their actions, as there would be no explanation as to why they acted in a particular way.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=5700)** Sean argues that it is a contradiction to believe in free will and also believe in a deterministic universe.
* **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=6000)** The Thought Adventure Podcast discusses a philosophical argument that goes by the name of the "extreme skeptic argument." The argument states that because the subject (i.e., the individual) needs to depend on an objective existence in order to exist, it is impossible to trust anything that the subject sees or hears. Therefore, the subject's existence is nothing more than an illusion, and the subject cannot be morally accountable for their actions.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=6300)**  Sean discusses the concept of logic and how it can be used to spot contradictions in someone's reasoning. He also explains how reason can dictate whether or not someone chooses to do something, based on their current condition.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=6600)**  Jake reads from a previous article in which he argues that a god does not need anything in order to be satisfied, and therefore creates contradictory statements. Jake provides an example of this contradiction in the form of the contradiction between the statement "I don't need the snickers bars, but I ate one" and the fact that Jake has reasons to eat the snickers bar.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=6900)* Discusses how humans need reasons to act, but argues that this is not always the case for God. Abdul Rahman provides an example of a choice that does not require a reason, and argues that God does not need reasons for His actions.
### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=7200) - [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=10800)

, lawyer Matthew Danish discusses how to spot logical contradictions. He explains that a logical contradiction arises when two things in a relationship are known to be contradictory, such as the idea that God knows humans will do something and humans are still free. He goes on to say that, in order to demonstrate this contradiction, the person doing the demonstration must first provide an explanation for why the two things are contradictory.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=7200)* Discusses how a logical contradiction arises when someone argues that God created something because he needs something to act because he is incomplete. also shares an example of how a logical contradiction can arise in the case of a counselor.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=7500)** Mr. Danish discusses two contradictions in logic - one between the Quran and early Muslims who believed in free will, and another between Allah testing people but knowing the future. He also mentions lawyer Matthew Bardos, who he thinks should not have been hired to defend someone in court.
* **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=7800)** The presenter discusses the argument that Jesus couldn't have been a man because this went against the intrinsic attributes of God, and then goes on to say that proof by contradiction is a big thing in logic.
* **[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=8100)**  Christian philosopher and Thought Adventure Podcast host Travis Graddol discusses how logical contradictions can exist in the Islamic conception of God. He explains that while humans have free will, this does not mean that Allah is powerless over them. Rather, humans have free will because Allah has granted it to them. Furthermore, Travis argues that the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation does not result in any contradictions.
* **[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=8400)**  the speaker explains how to spot logical contradictions, which is a problem for atheists because they try to apply their assumptions about reality to God. The better way to approach the question of why God creates is to first eliminate all of their presuppositions and look at it based on what we can sense.
* **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=8700)** , a lawyer discusses two contradictions in the Quran: that humans start on earth and are being tested by God, and that God already knows the outcome of the test. A logical contradiction is when something violates one of the three classical laws of thought.
* **[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=9000)* Discusses a contradiction found within Islam: that it says one thing, but then says another thing that contradicts this first thing. The contradiction is said to be an "internal contradiction," meaning that it exists within the religion itself rather than between the religion and reality.  then goes on to present a logical form for resolving the contradiction, which is that the test is not pointless, as it is related to justice.
* **[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=9300)** , Matthew discusses how a test can be both for the person being tested and the tester, and that a definition of a test can go either way. He argues that, because a test can be for the person being tested and the tester, a definition of a test must be flexible.
* **[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=9600)** argues that a logical contradiction exists when two things in a relationship are known to be contradictory, such as the idea that God knows humans will do something and humans are still free. He goes on to say that, in order to demonstrate this contradiction, the person doing the demonstration must first provide an explanation for why the two things are contradictory. He then gives an example of a professor demonstrating the effects of gravity by dropping a coin.
* **[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=9900)**  Matthew argues that it is possible for there to be a logical contradiction where one definition of a word is not equal to another. He goes on to say that this would only happen if one's definition of the word was the only possible definition.
* **[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=10200)** Sharif argues that tests do not necessitate ignorance of the outcome, but rather that the test-taker can know the outcome and still do it. He provides several counter-examples to this claim.
* **[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=10500)**  Matthew discusses how some people misunderstand the concept of "saying the truth is from your lord." He goes on to say that anyone who wishes to believe in Allah should do so, regardless of whether or not they believe in the Quran or Sunnah. Furthermore, he cites a number of verses from the Quran and Sunnah to back up his argument. Finally, he points out that there is a category of disbelievers who can become believers, and Allah reaffirms this reality in the Quran.
### [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=10800) - [03:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=13200)

 discusses how to spot logical contradictions and how to create effective arguments. It also discusses the rise in popularity of the Thought Adventure Podcast and how to become a supporter.

**[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=10800)** Disbelievers began with a certain mentality towards Islam and eventually their heart changed, resulting in them inclining towards the religion now. Abdul Rahman discusses how a perfect book is so confusing for those who don't understand it, but it is still clear and straightforward. He then critiques one of the characteristics of Allah - that he is omnipresent. However, he doesn't believe this to be true because Allah is not present in every single place in creation.
* **[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=11100)** The Islamic view of Allah is that he exists without beginning or end, and he created the universe at a particular time. The presenter asks a question about where Allah exists, and the Islamic view is that he occupies space, but does not have a specific location.
* **[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=11400)** of the video discusses how logic has nothing to do with it when it comes to understanding how God sustains creation. They say that before creation existed, there was no space for God's power to enter, so it was created at the same time. If creation isn't eternal, then God would need space that can encompass his power.
* **[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=11700)* Discusses the problem of logical contradictions and how they can be solved. He explains that contradictions arise when one tries to use concepts or ideas that are contradictory to each other. He goes on to say that when one understands that an idea or concept comes from eternity, and not time, then contradictions become less of an issue. then offers a solution to the contradiction of god's existence, which is that god exists simultaneously in both time and eternity.
* **[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=12000)**  Sharif discusses how certain passages from the Quran could be interpreted to imply that humans have free will. He argues that, even if this interpretation is correct, it does not contradict the idea that God creates everything.
* **[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=12300)** , Jake talks about a verse in the Quran that is used to try to justify free will. He explains that this verse is only related to the context of the verse, and there is no problem with the Islamic beliefs because the concepts of Islam are clear-cut.
* **[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=12600)** Brothers discuss the idea of logical contradictions, pointing out that just because something is possible doesn't mean it is plausible, reasonable, or a justifiable true belief. They then discuss the idea of an internal critique, which is used to determine whether or not something is false. They go on to discuss the possibility that the universe was created in a simulation, and how evidence must be provided in order to support that belief.
* **[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=12900)* Discusses how to spot logical contradictions, and how to create effective arguments. It also discusses the rise in popularity of the Thought Adventure Podcast, and how to become a supporter.
* **[03:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9A6HTKrfno&t=13200)**  the Thought Adventure Podcast discuss how to spot logical contradictions. They explain that sometimes there are two logically contradictory statements that are both true, and sometimes there are two statements that are both false, but only one of them is true. They also discuss how to figure out which of the two statements is true.

[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=172) discussion debate out  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=174) uh with uh reverend samuel green  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=177) yeah  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=178) [Laughter]  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=180) so in charlotte let's uh let's begin in  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=182) charlotte with the discussion today so  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=184) today we're talking about  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=186) the idea really  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=188) let me maybe give you a bit of a  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=189) background um as uh as i'm sure the  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=192) viewers know uh  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=194) jake's a no-nonsense type of guy yeah  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=198) if  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=200) he's uh you know we underlies you know  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=202) we keep him uh he's generally chilled on  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=205) our channel but he is generally a  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=206) no-nonsense type of guy  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=208) and one thing that really perturbs him  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=210) really doesn't he really hates  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=213) gets really  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=215) you know is when people start using  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=218) words like it's a it's a contradiction  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=220) or it's a it's illogical  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=222) it's a logical contradiction things like  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=224) this  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=225) or i'm doing is it logically incoherent  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=227) i'm doing an internal critique and these  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=229) types of things  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=230) and so what happens is that people tend  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=232) to  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=233) throw out these words  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=236) like it's illogical or logically  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=238) impossible or impossible without really  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=240) understanding what they're saying  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=242) and so  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=244) we thought  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=245) well we we obviously we did agree but  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=248) also jake was like no we've got to do a  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=250) show on this topic yeah  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=252) you know he pulls rank and he tells us  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=254) we've got to do a show on the topic of  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=256) logical contradiction and logical  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=257) impossibilities yeah and to understand  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=259) this because i think it will help the  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=262) the discussion further particularly  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=264) those people disagree with us they will  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=266) understand better what it means to  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=269) present an argument and you know  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=270) hopefully ensure that that'll be a good  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=272) thing  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=273) so maybe just the first couple of  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=275) questions that i was going to ask the  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=277) brothers here is oh we've got abdullah  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=279) in the house  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=286) so yeah so the first question i was  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=288) going to ask uh was  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=291) just generally you know why is logic  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=293) important you know sometimes people just  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=295) sort of think man logic what's all that  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=297) about i don't know yourself if you want  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=299) to give it like a very brief  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=301) why logic is important  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=304) what is it  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=305) yeah it definitely does so it relates to  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=307) argumentation and it relates to  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=311) specifically um the the connection  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=314) between statements  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=316) and whether or not something does follow  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=319) from something else  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=320) and so when we're talking about logic  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=322) specifically it's about arguments it's  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=324) about  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=325) you have something that you think people  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=328) should believe you have a proposition  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=330) that you want people to  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=332) hold or you want them to do something so  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=335) either you want them to believe  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=336) something or to act and do something in  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=338) the world and then you give  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=340) justifications or reasons  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=342) in order to motivate them in order to do  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=345) it and those justifications and those  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=347) reasons  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=348) necessarily lead to the conclusion  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=351) um that you want them to believe either  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=353) in terms of necessity or probability um  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=356) so necessity this would be called a  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=358) seductive argument so you've got a  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=360) number of propositions proposition one  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=361) proposition two  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=363) and then you have a conclusion which  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=364) follows from that and there's no debate  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=367) about it like a good example that's  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=368) usually given on this is um socrates as  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=370) a man  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=373) yeah yeah yeah jumping on it there we go  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=375) no no no no no  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=377) is normally the first one that they give  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=378) first premise yeah well to be honest  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=380) with logic doesn't matter the order  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=382) doesn't matter so the premises premises  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=385) one and two can be either way and what  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=387) matters is that the conclusion follows  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=389) from these so socrates is man or men  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=391) immortal or almond  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=393) socrates is a man  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=394) therefore  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=396) socrates is  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=398) a mortal  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=399) and you know this does follow from the  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=402) conclusions and it necessarily follows  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=404) now this is to do with logic whether or  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=408) not something is  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=409) logical or not is separate from the  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=412) notion of its truth  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=413) so we begin by discussing about validity  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=416) um and  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=418) we can talk about whether or not certain  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=421) premises are true later on  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=423) and this is in reference to what we call  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=425) it's whether or not the argument is  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=427) sound a sound argument is when it is  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=429) both valid that is the conclusion  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=432) necessarily follows from the premises  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=434) and the premises are true  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=436) if the premises are all true the  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=438) conclusion necessarily follows therefore  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=441) the conclusion is necessarily true  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=443) and this is obviously deductive  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=446) reasoning and then you have  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=447) inductive reasoning which is to talk  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=449) about probability  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=450) so you you um you're talking in terms of  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=453) like  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=454) you know um  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=456) most of the swans that i've seen are  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=459) white  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=460) um you know  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=462) there are swans at the local park the  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=465) next time i go there  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=466) um it's likely that those swans will be  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=470) white um and you're saying it's likely  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=472) here because you're open to the  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=474) possibility  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=475) um that there are other kinds of swans  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=477) for example there are black swans so  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=479) there is a small possibility that you  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=481) will see one and so it's it's not  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=483) illogical to make reference to the fact  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=486) that it's very likely that whatever swan  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=487) you do see that the swan will be white  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=489) um because this is again it's making  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=491) reference to chance to possibility  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=493) and you're making an inference to that  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=495) which is  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=496) most likely  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=498) um so that's uh  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=500) there's some others we can get into them  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=502) as well if you like but those are the  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=503) basic ones yeah so obviously it's  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=506) important  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=508) yeah so you've got deductive syllogisms  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=510) you have inductive syllogisms you have  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=512) abductive syllogisms  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=514) um but maybe jake maybe if i could uh  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=517) ask you  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=519) how necessary is it because obviously  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=522) the  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=523) you know you have a special branch of  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=525) you know studying kid philosophy  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=527) of logic you know specialists  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=530) logicians  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=531) are we basically saying you can't have a  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=534) valid argument you can't have any  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=536) discussion about these types of topics  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=538) unless you've studied in-depth  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=540) logic  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=543) uh no we're not saying that but i do  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=546) want to um give a bit of background  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=549) this is what sharif was saying about why  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=552) i think this um  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=554) subject is important and why i requested  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=556) it  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=556) because we're getting into  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=558) the realities we're on this channel in  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=560) particular  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=561) we use a lot of  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=563) sort of rational argumentation  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=565) for justifying beliefs discussing other  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=569) world views discussing points  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=572) and  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=573) part of that discourse  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=575) is being able to  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=578) recognize good arguments and bad  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=580) arguments right  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=582) and then trying to follow through the  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=584) conversation with the points that are  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=586) being made  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=587) and  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=588) i think what  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=590) and i'm not speaking for myself here  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=592) because i think the other brothers agree  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=593) what we notice is that many times  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=596) when talking to other people and  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=598) obviously we're not perfect but  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=600) when talking to other people  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=603) they at times make arguments that they  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=606) think they're pointing out a  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=607) contradiction  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=609) in  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=610) our worldview or somebody else's and  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=613) this happens with muslims as well so  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=615) it's not like i'm picking on atheists or  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=617) christians or anything like that  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=619) but  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=620) it happened so frequently  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=622) and what we started to realize is that  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=625) people don't really understand  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=627) what actually a contradiction is what a  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=630) good argument is what a bad one is and  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=633) so that's why we wanted to do this  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=635) stream to try to clarify things so that  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=638) the type of discourse that we're having  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=640) on tap  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=642) people can do their best with this maybe  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=645) video as a very basic level thing and  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=647) obviously it's not going to cover  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=648) everything but as a basic level  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=650) foundation for the type of discourse  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=653) that we have on tap  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=655) so that's primarily the the reason why i  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=658) suggested it and the other brother said  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=660) well yeah that that's basically a good  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=662) idea um so yeah now getting back to the  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=666) issue sharif what exactly was your  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=668) question again yeah so i was just saying  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=669) that you know because logic is quite can  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=671) be quite complex you know you have  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=673) things like first order logic fuzzy  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=675) logic and then you have classical logic  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=678) uh  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=679) so the question then becomes you know  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=681) how much do you need to know these  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=683) things  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=684) in order to make a you know in order to  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=687) build a world view in order to  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=688) understand arguments and ideas  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=691) you know  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=692) is it the case i have to go and study  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=694) logic at you know high level before i  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=697) can really build an argument or  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=699) no no so what what i would argue is that  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=703) the basic  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=705) type of reasoning or when we're talking  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=706) about logic here we're talking about a  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=708) particular way of reasoning now i know  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=711) that in the title of the video we're  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=713) going to eventually get to  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=714) contradictions  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=716) but the basic way of reasoning from from  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=719) one premise to another and having a  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=721) conclusion that follows  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=723) validly by the rules of inference  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=727) from from the premises that's what a  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=730) valid argument is a valid argument is  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=732) one in which the conclusion  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=735) follows from the premises right and then  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=738) a sound argument is one in which  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=740) not only does is the structure of the  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=743) argument valid but the premises are true  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=746) and because the conclusion follows from  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=748) the premises that if they're true the  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=750) conclusion is also true now this might  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=753) sound like oh well jake you just you  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=755) just went off on this and this proves  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=757) that you do need to study no  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=760) the this is just the type of words that  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=763) are used in the vocabulary that are  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=765) vocabulary vocabulary sorry guys that is  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=768) used to explain this idea  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=770) but  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=771) this sort of reasoning process  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=774) is i would argue is intuitive it's  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=777) something that we do every day people do  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=780) it every day like okay i'm waiting for  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=782) the car to turn so you know if i were to  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=785) turn now he would hit me and everybody  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=788) understands  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=790) in their daily activities without even  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=793) really knowing what they're doing  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=794) they're going through a reasoning  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=796) process which you're using like if then  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=800) for example condition conditional  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=801) statements well if i do this  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=804) then this will happen right yeah um and  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=807) and and then they're saying well  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=810) i don't want that to happen therefore  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=813) i'm not gonna do this  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=814) right so it's like well if i just go  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=817) ahead and go through the red light i'm  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=818) gonna get hit by a car  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=820) and i don't wanna get hit by a car  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=823) therefore i'm not gonna just burst  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=824) through the red light you see children  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=826) doing the same thing as well like they  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=828) don't want to get into trouble and they  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=830) know if  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=831) this happens then  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=833) i will get into trouble therefore i  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=835) don't want this to happen so they they  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=837) know they have to conceal certain  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=838) information or they need to  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=840) avoid certain kind of things or like if  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=843) they have done something  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=844) that they have to think of ways in order  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=846) to sort of get away with these and we  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=848) found out recently from um  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=851) brother youssef that when you actually  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=853) incentivize the children and tell them  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=855) that they're going to get points for  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=857) things that they do they're less likely  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=860) to try to conceal these things and be  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=862) naughty naughty so  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=864) yeah so that was a good but yeah that's  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=866) another example so  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=869) you can even see this type of behavior i  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=871) think yusuf's point was very early on  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=874) even in a child  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=876) and so  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=877) i we're giving sort of examples that  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=879) explain what we mean  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=881) by a basic reasoning process that  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=884) everybody undergoes and nobody's  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=886) thinking like  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=888) people think in terms of that vocabulary  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=890) well if i do this or this  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=892) and sometimes it happens so fast in the  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=894) mind that you don't even realize that  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=895) you're doing it  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=896) but the point is to answer sharif's  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=899) question is  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=901) everybody engages in their daily life in  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=904) this basic reasoning process  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=906) and sometimes  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=908) some people do it more consistently than  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=910) others sometimes you make a mistake  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=913) there are  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=914) certain things  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=916) that um  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=918) maybe we'll get to it later on as sort  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=920) of pointing out  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=922) the most common fallacies and reasoning  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=924) that people make without necessarily  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=927) recognizing it and so you don't need to  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=930) study  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=931) philosophy or logic at a university to  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=935) be able to  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=937) reason properly although i think it  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=939) would help  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=940) because it points out some of the common  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=943) mistakes that people make and to be  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=945) aware of them and know how to avoid them  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=948) is a good thing  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=949) but on a very basic level reasoning from  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=952) one premise to another to a conclusion  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=955) is intuitive people do it on a daily  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=957) basis  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=958) and what we want to do with this stream  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=960) is just point out  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=962) more in detail how that works how what  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=964) are some of the traps that people fall  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=966) into what exactly a contradiction is and  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=969) what it isn't and so that maybe it'll  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=972) facilitate for future discussions on tap  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=975) um you know not just the audience but us  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=978) as well to be clear on you know how  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=981) we're going to proceed and how these  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=983) conversations should be analyzed  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=985) basically yeah  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=986) uh abdul which i'll bring you  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=991) so  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=992) so really another  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=994) another question i just wanted to ask is  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=996) um  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=997) can you just really briefly talk about  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=999) like the three main propositions  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1003) that exist  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1005) yeah obviously you know for the audience  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1007) and everybody who's listening today  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1008) you're asking about this  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1010) yeah yeah abdul yeah  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1012) yeah but i'm just saying for the  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1013) audience as well is that this is really  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1015) basic stuff we're not going into some  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1017) you know crazy detail or anything like  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1019) that i'm sure the brothers here can go  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1021) into more detail but i just want to make  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1023) it so clear so easy so that people can  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1025) understand the basic bare minimum levels  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1028) of a of a good argument a good  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1031) discussion so i i don't know uh  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1033) abdulrahman if you want to just give  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1034) some sort of sorry i you know i didn't  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1036) hear the answer  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1038) yeah the question would be the question  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1039) sorry  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1040) yeah yeah the question was can you just  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1042) briefly outline what the three main  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1045) propositions are well actually just  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1047) could you explain what a proposition is  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1049) as well maybe that's uh a a pr a  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1052) proposition is just a proposition is  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1055) basically uh like in philosophical  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1057) language it's called a truth bearer it's  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1059) basically a  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1061) sentence that contains a truth value  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1063) it's either true or false so that's  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1066) basically what a proposition is  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1068) right okay then so can you explain maybe  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1070) what are the three main propositions  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1072) that we have  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1074) are you talking about the laws of logic  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1077) uh well yeah yeah  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1079) so yeah no no not the laws of logic  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1080) sorry not the laws of logic it's a  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1082) proposition so you know  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1083) oh in terms of modality yeah okay yeah  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1086) so they're saying that brother grief is  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1088) a gem here by the way we we had a recent  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1091) argument who's the favorite that people  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1094) the audience has on top  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1097) i think it's becoming more more clear  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1100) people love sharif but that's okay  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1103) yeah anyways  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1105) so yeah so in terms of modality so in  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1108) terms of like logically possible  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1109) logically uh uh necessary and uh and  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1113) impossible so we have statements that  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1116) are logically possible statements that  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1117) is logically possible is basically a  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1120) statement that is not a contradiction or  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1123) does not entail a contradiction now a  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1125) contradiction is simply you know uh uh  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1128) the community  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1130) yeah so so okay so  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1132) basically a and not a so if something  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1135) basically doesn't  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1136) uh boil down to a camp if it can't be  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1138) reduced to a contradiction then it it is  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1142) said to be logically possible or if it  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1144) doesn't entail a contradiction because  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1145) if it entail if you can derive a  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1147) contradiction from it then  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1149) then you could you could then that is  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1151) also you know uh uh  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1153) not logically possible so logically uh  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1157) necessary truths are  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1159) uh are like  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1160) uh the laws of logic you know  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1163) mathematical truths and stuff like that  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1165) things that must be  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1167) you know things that  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1169) their absence would entail some kind of  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1171) a logical contradiction and a a a  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1175) logical impossibility is just simply the  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1177) opposite of a logic logical possibility  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1179) which is basically something that is or  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1181) entails a logical contradiction okay so  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1183) a proposition is like a truth bearer  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1186) some sort of you know maybe in common  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1188) language we say a statement  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1190) so a statement that could be true or  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1192) false  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1193) that statement that proposition could be  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1196) logically possible  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1198) logically impossible or logically  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1200) necessary yeah and so uh  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1204) i don't know if you could give me an  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1206) example of a logical possible  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1207) proposition abdu  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1209) um some crazy one  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1211) there is a crazy  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1213) there's a pink elephant playing video  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1215) games behind the moon  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1216) okay right so  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1221) that's logically possible apparently so  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1223) logically possible so in that context  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1226) when you say something's logically  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1227) possible you're not saying it's probable  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1230) or plausible  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1231) yeah yeah so the most ridiculous thing  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1233) in the world can be logically possible  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1235) just it just doesn't it just isn't or  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1236) does not entail a logical contradiction  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1238) yeah  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1240) another one would be uh the existence of  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1242) the universe popped into existence five  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1245) minutes ago that's one of my favorite  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1247) ones it is technically possible with all  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1249) of the history all your memories all of  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1251) that all of that was created five  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1253) minutes ago but you could also say six  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1255) minutes seven minutes etc  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1257) so yes so a logical proposition logical  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1260) proposition is any proposition that does  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1263) not entail a contradiction  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1265) yeah so it's logically possible it  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1267) doesn't mean it's true  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1268) yes i think that's really important it  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1270) just means it's a possibility it doesn't  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1272) entail a contradiction so jake uh let's  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1275) let's talk about man what's a logical  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1278) impossibility what does that actually  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1279) mean  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1282) yeah sorry i was trying to i'll meet my  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1284) mic there um  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1287) yeah so i think the example that abdul  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1289) gave and and also yusuf was good about  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1292) logical possibility because  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1294) i think  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1296) when you contrast it with what i'm about  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1298) to say i hope people will understand it  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1300) because people are saying well how is  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1302) that even logically possible sounds so  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1304) bizarre it doesn't make any sense  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1307) and well yeah it does none of us really  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1310) think that that exists right and  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1313) we don't think that it's probable at all  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1316) um  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1317) but  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1318) when you're saying that something is  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1320) logically impossible what you're  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1322) basically saying  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1323) is that the the sentence or the phrase  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1326) or the claim whatever is being made it  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1328) literally doesn't have meaning it  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1330) doesn't even really make any sense and  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1332) so you can just by the words alone  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1336) derive a an internal contradiction  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1339) within it that's what makes something  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1341) impossible so an example of this would  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1344) be like a married bachelor right and so  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1348) we all know what it means to be married  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1350) we all know what it means to be a  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1351) bachelor a bachelor is an unmarried man  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1355) and so when you say that there exists a  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1358) married bachelor you're literally saying  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1361) a married unmarried man well that's a  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1364) contradiction because now the man is  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1366) both married and he's unmarried he's not  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1369) married and so within that phrase itself  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1372) there's a contradiction  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1374) now i hope people can see the difference  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1376) between that and the example of i think  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1379) uh abdus and elephant playing video  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1382) games behind the moon there's a  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1384) difference between that because although  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1385) it sounds so bizarre there's nothing  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1388) within the wording itself that renders  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1391) the sentence or the proposition  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1394) meaningless or self-contradictory  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1396) whereas with the married bachelor it is  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1398) a internal contradiction same thing  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1401) would be like for a square circle right  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1404) so we all know what a circle is we all  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1407) know what a square is to say that  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1409) there's this thing which is both a  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1411) square and a circle simultaneously and  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1413) let's just give it the name of a square  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1416) circle  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1417) not a circle which is squared or square  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1420) which is made into a circle that is  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1422) certainly possible but something that is  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1424) simultaneously  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1426) a circle right and also a square square  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1429) which has four angles and a circle which  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1433) doesn't have it to say that you can have  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1435) a square circle is contradictory right  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1438) and so uh these are some examples some  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1441) basic examples for the audience i don't  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1443) want to pile on too many but when we  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1446) talk about logical impossibility we're  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1448) literally saying  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1450) that the the phrase or the sentence is  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1453) contradictory such that  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1455) it has no meaning you can't even  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1458) really imagine of it you can't you can't  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1460) even conceive of it in any meaningful  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1462) way  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1463) and something like a  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1465) married bachelor or square circle would  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1467) fit the bill now  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1469) practically speaking i'll give an  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1471) example  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1472) if somebody comes up to you and says  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1474) well hey you know what uh brother sharif  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1477) i i've got this new invention for you  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1480) i've got a square circle in my back  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1482) pocket i'm going to pull it out and i'm  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1483) going to show you well already before  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1486) he's even pulling it out you're  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1487) imagining what is this guy on about  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1490) there's something something wrong with  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1491) him is there such there's not even a  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1494) possibility there's not even a remote  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1496) possibility that he could have a square  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1498) circle in his back pocket right  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1500) now you might get a similar reaction  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1502) with the elephant on the moon thing but  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1505) um it's not in the same realm because at  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1508) least the statement itself is meaningful  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1512) so um i don't want to get too far into  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1516) the weeds but i hope that's simple  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1517) enough yes could you could you just  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1520) could you just con like comment on this  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1522) because i think it's related this  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1524) comment right here i think it's related  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1526) to this like he's using logical in a  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1528) different way  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1529) yeah yeah so we actually did a whole  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1532) stream on this guys and what we're going  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1534) to do um  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1536) i think if we have time we're going to  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1537) try to bring up examples  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1540) based on conversations that we've had on  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1543) tap in the past and we're gonna say okay  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1546) here's an example  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1548) of what a contradiction is here's an  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1550) example of what a contradiction is not  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1553) and try to show the difference so we're  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1555) gonna i think try to reference previous  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1557) conversations that we had before we let  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1560) guests on but one of the streams that we  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1562) did we did an entire stream  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1565) on miracles and whether or not miracles  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1567) are contradictory are they illogical i  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1570) think was the exact phrase  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1572) uh i would have to so uh yusuf if you  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1574) could actually pull it up and post it in  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1577) the chat for  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1578) for the fellow who answered ask that  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1580) question  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1581) i would suggest watching that for more  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1583) detailed  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1585) uh  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1586) discussion on miracles  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1588) and  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1589) whether or not they're illogical so  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1591) without going into too much detail with  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1593) that no  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1595) the idea of the moon being split or a  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1597) miracle is not illogical it might be  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1601) highly improbable or  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1603) seem so astonishing and i think even as  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1606) muslims we would agree with that because  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1608) it doesn't fall under the natural order  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1611) of things you don't see these type of  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1612) things happening every day so to speak  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1615) but there's nothing illogical about it  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1618) in the sense that when we talk about  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1620) in terms of it's strictly being a  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1623) contradictor a contradiction  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1625) the moon being split in half there's  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1627) nothing contradictory about that in the  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1629) same way that you can derive a  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1631) contradiction from the statement that  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1634) there is a square circle or that there  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1636) is a married bachelor within the meaning  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1640) of the words itself you can derive a  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1642) contradiction internally such that the  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1645) statement becomes meaningless now when i  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1647) say that the moon was split in two  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1649) you're like whoa that seems a bit  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1651) bizarre and yeah i'm with you there but  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1653) there's nothing within that statement  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1655) itself that it's contradictory you could  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1657) not derive a contradiction from that  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1660) wording alone in the same way that you  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1663) could with a married bachelor or squared  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1665) circle and so i think if people want a  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1667) fuller defense of how miracles are not  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1671) actually uh logical contradictions i  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1674) think you should watch that stream yeah  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1676) i think the problem so going yourself  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1679) yeah i was just gonna say and and this  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1680) gentleman here he could probably just  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1683) zoom straight to the beginning of this  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1684) video and then just start from the  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1686) beginning because i think we explained  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1688) pretty well why  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1689) this just shows a basic lack of under uh  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1692) misunderstanding with regards to what  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1695) like something being illogical is so um  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1698) like jake was saying  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1700) things might sound bizarre  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1702) um but we've got examples of things  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1704) sounding bizarre and sounding strange  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1706) all the time and the the bizarreness of  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1709) them is not reason enough to dismiss  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1711) them the results for example from the  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1714) double slit experiment are very bizarre  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1716) they're very weird  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1718) but you know it doesn't mean that  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1720) the results don't occur simply because  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1722) they're strange or simply because they  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1724) act counterintuitively the scientist  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1726) says to you that you know a particle is  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1729) in a superposition  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1730) um you know that sounds very bizarre but  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1733) just pointing out that something is  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1735) strange is not enough um to be able to  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1738) dismiss it so there are conditions in  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1742) which something can be possible so for  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1744) example this idea of an elephant  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1747) playing on a computer game behind the  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1749) moon like you can envisage conditions in  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1752) which that becomes possible like you if  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1755) you've it is possible that we can for  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1757) example go into space we can maybe fire  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1759) an elephant over there  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1761) and you know there could have been some  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1762) secrets yeah  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1764) you're  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1769) there are possibilities there are  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1770) conditions in which these things can  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1772) occur  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1773) um and allow these sort of things to  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1775) happen within the statements themselves  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1777) so you can have atomic statements and  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1779) compound statements so atomic statements  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1781) just one claim like um you know this is  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1785) made of metal this is metal um  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1788) a compound statement is like this is and  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1790) then you have like a conjunction like  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1792) and or or something and then another  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1795) statement with it and contradictions  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1797) arise generally out of compound  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1799) statements with conflicting elements  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1802) within them so you'll have  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1803) proposition a at one part of the  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1805) statement and then proposition not a  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1808) in the other in such a way that you're  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1810) you're  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1811) making them a conjunction so you're  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1812) saying they are both the case at the  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1814) same time and that's where they sort of  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1816) implode and become meaningless because  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1818) you're not really communicating anything  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1820) like  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1820) the example she gave so the married  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1822) bachelor the reason that this is  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1825) inherently illogical is because married  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1829) is the negation of unmarried they are  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1831) complete they are the opposites of each  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1834) other and so you can't have them in  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1835) conjunction you can't say that something  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1837) is a and not a simultaneously  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1841) now there is nothing like that in the  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1843) statement and the moon was split in two  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1846) you don't have two elements that are the  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1849) negation of each other or that come into  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1851) conflict the example of the squared  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1853) circle  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1854) so what by definition what makes the  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1857) square a square  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1858) by definition a square  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1861) is something that has four sides and has  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1864) four angles that add up to 360 degrees  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1867) that is what makes a square a square now  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1869) by definition a circle is not that at  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1873) all and so  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1874) if the conditions which make a circle a  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1877) circle  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1878) it cannot be the case without  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1881) the conditions that make a square a  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1882) square then you can't have these at the  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1884) same time you can't say that something  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1886) is a square and they circle  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1887) simultaneously because by definition  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1890) what makes them uh it's it's not  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1892) possible to have them simultaneously you  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1894) don't have that in the statement that  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1896) the moon was split into  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1899) the pink elephant behind yeah yeah yeah  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1901) although there's a pink that the  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1902) statement in and of itself remember  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1904) we're not talking about the truthfulness  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1907) of the statements at this point we're  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1909) talking about whether or not there is  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1911) any um validity  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1913) in certain statements whether it is  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1914) possible to use them  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1916) and obviously then you can build  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1918) arguments with statements that  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1921) are valid statements that there's no  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1922) inner conflicts within the statements  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1924) itself they can be a part of an argument  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1927) and then you can build on that you find  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1928) out whether it's valid and then you  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1930) assess each statement as to whether it's  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1932) true  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1933) that now the truthfulness is not the  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1936) same as talking about its logical  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1939) coherency so you can say that it's not  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1942) true that the moon was split into  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1944) yeah and this is a separate claim this  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1947) isn't to say that it's illogical or not  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1950) because it is logically possible  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1952) what you can then talk about is maybe  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1953) whether or not the argument that  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1955) contains such a proposition  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1957) is faulty  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1958) but that does not say that the statement  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1961) itself is incoherent  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1963) yeah i think the problem the problem is  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1965) is that when people use the word logic  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1967) illogical  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1968) you know you're being you know illogical  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1970) here they're using it in a very loose  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1972) colloquial way and what we try to do is  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1975) we try to say no no we need to use it  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1977) very precisely because you're not using  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1979) it precisely then you're going to talk  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1981) past each other so you need to  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1983) understand what the particular  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1984) definition is  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1985) and you know it's interesting because  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1987) jake talked about a meaningless  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1989) statement and you know jake whenever he  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1990) talks to trinity and he asks him about  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1992) the is of identity or is it predication  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1995) and the person says i mean one guy  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1997) recently said it's both  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=1999) and  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2000) jay said  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2001) that's literally a meaningless statement  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2004) yeah  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2004) no  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2006) that won't set me off  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2008) yeah yeah  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2009) now sometimes people when they  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2012) when when they hear that term  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2013) meaningless statement  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2015) they think jake is using it in a in a  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2017) hyperbolic way he's just trying to  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2019) emphasize a point  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2021) but jake is using it in a very strictly  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2024) definitional way he's saying that the  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2026) sentence you're making  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2028) literally carries no value of meaning  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2032) that's the issue that's what we say when  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2033) we say it's a logical impossibility the  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2036) statement that's carried within a  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2037) logical impossible  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2039) possible proposition  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2041) carries no meaning whatsoever it's not  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2044) like i can imagine the meaning i can't  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2047) even imagine it as a meaningful as a  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2050) meaning itself  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2051) and similarly uh you know if you have  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2053) two propositions one  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2055) is uh you know an affirmation the second  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2058) proposition is a negation of the first  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2060) then it results in this thing which is  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2062) it becomes meaningless to us as human  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2065) beings it's illogical and i think this  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2068) is why it's also important to uh  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2071) you know people who appeal to mystery  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2074) when you point out a logical  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2076) contradiction within their belief  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2078) they can't appeal to mystery at this  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2079) moment in time because  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2081) you're basically saying your proposition  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2083) that you're trying to convey is  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2085) meaningless it has no meaning and so now  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2088) if you say it's a mystery why it has no  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2091) meaning it literally means you're not  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2093) calling to anything yeah  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2095) you're not calling to anything which is  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2097) meaningful yeah  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2099) so uh you know these are technical  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2102) points and so i think the audience needs  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2103) to really appreciate this point but i  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2105) want to just really quickly because we  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2106) want to give some examples but one final  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2108) uh question to abdul uh is what's the  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2112) difference between a logical  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2113) impossibility it's me possibility and a  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2116) metaphysical  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2117) impossibility or are they the same thing  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2120) no they're they're not as they're not  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2122) the same thing so um a a logical uh  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2125) possibility is basically it's broader  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2128) than a metaphysical possibility or  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2131) impossibility depending on on on on what  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2134) you know  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2135) you know scope of modality you have in  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2137) mind but the idea is that something that  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2139) is logically possible like for example  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2141) the pink elephant playing video games  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2143) behind the moon doesn't necessitate that  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2145) it's metaphysically possible and  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2147) metaphysically possible means possible  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2149) in the actual world in the sense that  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2152) there is a genuine  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2153) you know actual metaphysical possibility  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2156) for this thing to occur  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2157) so er so by according to a lot of people  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2160) uh just depends sometimes  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2163) not every logical possibility  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2165) is always a a metaphysical possibility  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2168) if you hold to some sort of  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2169) conceivability theory in in in  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2172) conceivability approach to modality and  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2175) you think that every logically possible  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2179) you know statement or proposition or  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2181) thing is actually metaphysically  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2183) possible that's a different story but  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2185) there is a serious distinction between  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2187) them in the sense that  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2189) not everything that is just logically  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2191) possible has to have an actual  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2192) metaphysical possibility in the real  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2194) world  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2195) so so the way i sort of understand it is  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2197) a metaphysical possibility or that's  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2199) physical impossibility is that you have  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2201) certain commitments yes and axioms or  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2204) prior commitments that you hold and then  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2207) based upon those axioms and pride  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2208) commitments you then start to  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2211) assess a logical possible statement uh  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2214) within that paradigm so so yeah you so  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2217) logical possible statement just saying a  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2219) state a sentence that has carries a  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2221) meaning yeah the actual sentence yeah  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2224) carries a meaning a metaphysical  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2227) uh impossibility saying okay the  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2229) sentence carries a meaning that's bare  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2231) minimum yeah that doesn't tell me  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2233) whether it actually exists now i have  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2235) certain prior commitments i have certain  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2237) understandings or certain principles i  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2240) understand to be correct or true that i  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2242) act and develop ideas by based on that  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2246) i'm going to look at you know uh whether  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2249) this possible meaningful statement can  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2252) be actualized  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2253) is that correct  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2255) yeah that's true and and  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2257) not just whether it it is actualized i  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2260) think it's whether it can be actualized  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2261) whether there is a genuine metaphysical  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2263) possibility for attack it doesn't have  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2265) to be real but you when you make  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2267) statements about metaphysical modality  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2269) what you're saying is that you're making  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2271) statements about what actually can be  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2274) so uh  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2275) and and  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2276) an example  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2277) i think i've heard uh jake or maybe had  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2280) to use before was um  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2282) was a ball being all red and all blue at  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2285) the same time in the same way now i  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2287) think this is a bit of a technicality  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2288) because what some people want to say is  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2290) that that's a metaphysical possibility  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2292) but it's not a logical impossibility now  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2294) of course you'd have to agree  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2296) because if you if you reduce the  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2298) statement the ball is red and the ball  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2300) is blue like you know you take those  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2302) like you know what we call logic simple  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2303) statements and you simplify them and  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2306) using symbolic logic you're not going to  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2307) come out with any kind of contradiction  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2309) because there's nothing about those  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2310) symbols that really tells you what  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2313) red is and what blue is right but i mean  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2316) that's just a bit of a technicality  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2317) because if we can say based on our  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2320) experience which again that's gonna  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2321) that's going to involve some sort of you  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2324) know empirical investigation so once we  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2326) have the experience that blue is not red  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2329) then here you'd have uh you can  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2331) basically derive a contradiction from  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2333) the statement that the ball is blue all  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2335) blue all over and read all over by  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2338) saying that you know blue equals not red  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2340) so the ball is red and not red so it's a  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2342) bit of a technicality sometimes but uh  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2345) but generally speaking the idea is that  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2348) uh logical possibilities uh really deal  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2352) with the rules of logic and you know  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2355) inference and and and how we understand  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2357) contradictions and metaphysical  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2359) possibility is a bit of a narrower  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2362) modal scope than that because  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2364) you know we want to talk about what's  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2366) actual or what's actually possible  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2370) yeah okay i i don't know if we want to  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2372) go on to some of the clips uh yeah we we  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2376) will i just want to give uh one example  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2378) of  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2379) a common a common fallacy in in  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2382) reasoning uh which which is known as  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2385) affirming the consequence so  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2387) in in logic you have uh basically if p  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2391) then q  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2392) uh p therefore q that's the standard  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2395) but  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2396) in this type of reasoning what people do  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2398) is they say well if p then q q therefore  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2402) p  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2403) uh and i'm going to break it down just  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2406) one simple example would be like  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2408) somebody saying well if it is raining  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2411) then the  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2412) street is wet  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2414) uh the street is wet  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2416) therefore it is raining well it doesn't  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2419) necessarily follow i mean yeah if if it  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2422) is uh raining then the street is wet but  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2424) just because it's wet  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2426) doesn't mean that it's raining and how  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2429) you can understand that is by  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2431) understanding that well there are other  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2433) possibilities  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2435) in which  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2436) the streak could be wet and yet it's not  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2438) raining so you can think of it as well  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2441) there could be kids playing outside uh  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2444) one of them turned the hose on and they  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2445) just started you know rinsing the whole  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2447) street or they could have been having a  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2449) balloon fight and the  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2451) the uh the street got wet could have  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2453) been that a truck went by with some type  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2456) of liquid made maybe been water in it  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2458) and tipped over and the whole street got  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2460) wet so there are other possibilities in  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2463) which  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2464) that condition could be met without that  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2468) uh antecedent clause happening and so  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2470) the point is this is a very common  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2473) feature  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2474) in reasoning it's one of the most common  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2476) mistakes that people make they say oh  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2478) well if this happens  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2480) then this will happen  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2482) the latter thing which is called the  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2484) consequent happened therefore the other  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2487) thing necessarily happened that's wrong  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2489) that's an invalid way of of reasoning  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2493) from a premise premise to a conclusion i  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2495) just wanted to point out that uh one  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2497) common mistake that people make because  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2500) i also see that quite frequently in  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2502) discussions with people they they  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2504) violate or they they you know sort of um  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2508) are victim to this fallacy which is  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2510) called affirming the consequence so i  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2512) hope that uh helps out somewhat  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2516) cool cool  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2517) yeah i've got the clips ready if unless  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2520) you guys had any further comment so  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2523) uh let me just share the screen here one  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2525) second  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2527) so i think we want to go to a few of the  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2529) discussions that we've had and i think  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2531) just only a few minutes i think we can  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2532) double speed as well  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2534) uh thing is good because it really  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2537) highlights this this issue  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2539) that we're talking about especially when  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2541) abdul asks questions  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2543) yeah so the first one we're going to  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2545) look at is one with uh pine creek  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2548) also known as mr icky  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2550) um yes i nicknamed him so i'll take  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2553) credit for that guys he also demanded to  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2556) be referred to as that as well  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2562) yeah he doesn't mind so here's a short  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2564) clip from him and and the point of this  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2566) is to try to give you examples of what  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2568) we're saying  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2570) isn't actually a contradiction at least  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2572) in this case anyway and then maybe some  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2574) examples of of what would be  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2576) so here we go with mr pine creek i'm  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2580) going to start it off at um  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2582) one and a half and if you think i should  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2585) go faster sharif just let me know  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2587) the point can you make can you make the  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2588) argument sorry i don't mean so you just  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2590) make the argument right now and premise  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2591) premise conclusion form well i'll try um  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2593) supremacist one would be god doesn't  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2594) like sin he doesn't like disbelieve  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2596) premise two would be something like god  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2597) knows the future with certainty he's  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2599) never surprised i think both of these  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2600) things people these premises you guys  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2602) agree with three um  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2604) it would be that he knows with certainty  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2606) some will disbelieve in hell  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2608) uh conclusion  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2610) all that was okay with some people just  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2611) believing in going to hell  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2613) so so so that's why  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2615) that conclusion  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2616) was okay with people disbelieving and  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2618) going to hell  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2620) just for the do you want to say  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2621) something  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2622) yeah i was just saying i think we  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2624) shouldn't do it two-time speed for the  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2625) benefit of the this isn't two times this  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2627) is one and a half you think it's too  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2629) fast  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2630) yeah it's not too fine  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2632) yeah i think it's fine it's fine okay  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2635) okay uh did you want to comment yusuf or  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2637) you just stopped for that no i was just  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2639) thinking in terms of those watching this  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2642) trying to figure out  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2643) logical contradictions it'd probably be  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2645) better just to have it normal speed  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2647) just because some people get thrown off  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2649) even at 1.5 i i'm cool with two times um  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2652) but i know people complain about the  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2654) putting the speed up a lot  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2656) oh okay i'll what i'll do is i'll put it  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2659) at 1.25  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2662) i'm gonna meet you guys halfway all  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2664) right now that's an executive decision  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2666) okay here we go  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2667) right uh are you saying that that  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2669) contradicts  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2670) all i'm saying  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2673) it's not okay so you're arguing from  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2675) emotion here because it's not going to  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2676) feel like you okay  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2678) here so here here here's the issue  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2680) here's the issue  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2682) what you want what you want to say what  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2684) you want to say what you want to say is  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2686) that  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2687) you know this world that god actualized  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2689) is not ideal in the sense that there is  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2691) evil in it and people will be tortured  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2693) in hell for an eternity therefore yes  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2696) yes therefore it is it is something that  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2698) is not uh you know the best of all  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2700) possible world or it's not something  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2702) that's morally good or justified right  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2704) but uh let me ask you a question are  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2706) what are your views on morality what's  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2708) what's your underlying ethical theory  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2710) that i want to assume that i have none  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2712) how can i then how can i understand what  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2714) you mean by good and evil i'm using your  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2715) definitions  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2716) what is my definition of good and evil  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2719) should we pause it there i think that's  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2721) yeah yeah that that's it yeah so  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2724) um  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2726) no i was just gonna say  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2728) um  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2729) that was the point where you had me to  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2731) stop so  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2732) at the end there you'll you'll see  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2734) abdul was pressing him on well  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2737) what's your standard and he claims well  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2738) he's using our standard but what you'll  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2741) actually find out is he's not using our  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2744) standard because if he was using our  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2746) standard to make the argument well then  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2749) the whole thing falls apart because  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2750) obviously we don't believe the premise  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2753) of what he was saying that well if god  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2755) knows that some people will reject him  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2757) basically and go to hell then  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2760) he shouldn't create was basically kind  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2762) of the argument and we're saying no we  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2764) don't we don't believe in that so he  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2766) wasn't going based on our  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2769) uh presupposition  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2770) presuppositions and even then  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2772) he wasn't reducing our position to a  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2775) contradiction but go ahead uh if you  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2777) guys want to come i was gonna  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2779) yeah so i was just i was gonna bring up  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2781) doing to this because  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2783) uh  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2784) abdul rahmani asked him the question  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2785) okay lay out your argument what is your  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2788) argument against it yeah  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2791) and so i think i can't remember the  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2792) exact premises that he he gives he sort  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2794) of says god created the world  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2797) it's got disbelief in it  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2799) uh people gonna go to hell or that and  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2802) he goes therefore people are gonna go to  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2804) hell  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2805) and so it's like uh you know it wasn't  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2808) it wasn't it wasn't even the proper i  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2810) don't i think it was just premises  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2811) without a conclusion if i if i'm  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2820) yeah i think what he was trying he was  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2821) trying to derive a contradiction from  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2823) the idea that god does not like sin but  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2825) god allows sin but you see you see like  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2829) syntactically right if you see if you  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2830) look at these two statements if you want  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2832) to reduce them to simple sentences right  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2836) and and  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2837) where's the contradiction so god does  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2838) not like sin  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2840) god  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2840) allowed sin right  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2843) forget about all the other discussions  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2845) on the problem of evil and what that  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2846) entails on all that stuff  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2848) if if you understand what a  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2849) contradiction is you'll realize that  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2851) that's not a contradiction you still if  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2853) you want to you know derive an actual  
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2855) contradiction from god allowing  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2858) for for sin to exist then you have to do  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2860) a bit more work something like god likes  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2862) sin and god does not like sin right yeah  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2865) yeah  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2865) yeah  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2866) so that just  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2868) a good way of just showing that  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2870) something isn't for example a  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2872) contradiction in this case would be to  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2874) give a counter example so are there any  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2876) cases where someone allows something  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2877) that they don't like  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2879) yeah of course like for example people  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2882) don't like pain but they'll put up with  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2885) it for other purposes so for example you  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2887) know people might go to the gym  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2889) because they want to look buff  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2891) whatever it is that they want to do or  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2893) whatever aim they're trying to achieve  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2896) from going to the gym despite not liking  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2898) pain they will put up with it because of  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2900) something so and that's just one example  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2903) if you can give a counter example that  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2905) shows where these two elements you say  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2907) shouldn't  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2908) um coincide or you know you can't have  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2911) these in a statement in a conjunction  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2913) and that is both of them  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2915) and affirming both of them  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2916) simultaneously um then it shouldn't be  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2918) the case that there would be any counter  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2919) examples  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2920) you wouldn't be able to come up with any  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2922) at all and that would show i mean that's  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2924) a in that case though like a better a  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2926) better syllogism he could have come up  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2927) with like would be like god  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2930) cannot or does not allow things that he  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2933) does not like  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2935) god does not like sin therefore god  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2937) cannot or does not allow sin i mean at  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2939) least in terms of validity give me  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2941) something valid to work with then we can  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2943) start questioning the premises but in  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2944) this case  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2946) it was all over the place because  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2947) there's nothing to work with in the  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2948) sense that uh you couldn't derive a  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2951) conclusion from the premises he was  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2953) providing  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2954) uh yeah so yeah and i and he at the end  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2956) of the day he admitted it was an  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2957) argument from emotion so i guess the  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2959) whole walk  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2961) yeah yeah and i think it's the the point  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2963) here is this is  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2965) for us to address an argument  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2967) we have to be presented with an argument  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2970) i think that's the issue  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2971) so if if they're not presenting an  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2973) argument this is why it constantly will  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2975) always ask the question what's the  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2976) actual point what is you what are you  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2978) trying to get at he's trying to say it's  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2980) an internal critique it's a  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2981) contradiction what's your point  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2983) if they're not presenting an argument  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2985) then there's nothing uh  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2987) there's nothing for us to deal with  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2989) there's nothing for us to address really  
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2991) you know um  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2993) and uh just one final point before we  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2995) move on to the next clip for pancreatics  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2997) is when somebody says something's a  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=2999) logical contradiction yeah or a logical  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3002) impossibility  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3003) the burden of proof now shifts to them  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3006) they are now in a position to  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3007) demonstrate that it is impossible yeah  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3011) uh so you know the the burden of proof  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3013) shifts uh slightly so when people say  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3016) your position is in is internally  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3018) contradictory the islamic position is  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3020) incidentally contradictory he's now in a  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3023) position to have to substantiate that  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3026) position we you know we don't have to  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3028) substantiate the position  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3030) uh you know say no no no it's not a  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3031) logical country we have to say no you  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3033) you now have to prove it okay give me an  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3036) argument and from that argument now we  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3038) can investigate whether it does entail a  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3040) logical contradiction can i can i say  
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3042) something about that because i mean  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3045) sometimes it gets really frustrating and  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3047) i think uh  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3048) i think many at least sharif and jake  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3050) they know who i'm talking about when  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3052) when i mention like there are people who  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3053) we've been speaking to for quite a while  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3055) about logic and logical contradictions  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3058) and when when they try to present us  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3060) with logical contradictions in our  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3061) worldview they come up with the most  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3063) ridiculous things like for example uh  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3065) the moon splitting and also a couple of  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3067) days ago someone brought up two verses  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3070) that he said like you know in the quran  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3071) it's contradictory man being created  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3073) from sperm and man being created from  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3075) dust  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3076) now  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3077) the reason this is so ridiculous is  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3079) because  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3080) you see jake for example right when he  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3082) tries to address the logical problem  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3083) with trinity he lays it out you know all  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3086) the premises and what the apparent  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3088) problem is and then he doesn't say  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3090) therefore your belief in  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3092) the trinity is a an actual contradiction  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3095) what he says is that  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3097) there seems to be a problem here and  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3099) then he starts asking you questions  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3102) in what way are you saying in what way  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3104) are the is god statements uh you know  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3106) being made are they statements of  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3107) predication or statements of identity  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3109) and he takes you through a line of  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3111) reasoning where you get to do a lot of  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3113) explaining you get to explain what you  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3116) mean by the words you're saying and from  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3118) there we can say whether it entails a  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3120) contradiction and in many cases it does  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3122) not  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3123) so like for example uh uh um they're  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3126) just on the surface of it uh william  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3129) lane craig's partialism doesn't seem to  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3131) be contradictory in the same way you  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3133) know uh  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3134) other forms of trinitarianism are and so  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3138) in jake's discussions and and and  
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3140) generally in our discussions with  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3141) christians that's what we do we allow  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3142) them that space in the sense that we're  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3144) saying there is an apparent problem  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3146) there seems to be a problem here now  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3148) what do you mean by these words and does  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3150) it necessitate a contradiction it and  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3152) and that's really the way it should be  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3154) done it shouldn't be that you know this  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3156) scent this look like in the case of from  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3159) sperm and from dust well  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3162) you see a contradiction needs to be  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3165) a and not a  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3167) at the same time in the same way like it  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3169) needs to be something you're you're  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3170) making  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3171) you're saying that a statement is both  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3173) true and false  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3174) at the same time in the same way  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3176) this is very far from that you need to  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3178) do a lot more work you need to ask what  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3181) people mean by the words they're using  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3182) in order to basically come to the  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3185) conclusion that it is a contradictory  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3188) incoherent position yeah yeah william  
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3190) lane craig's model is heretical and it  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3193) has other problems but yeah yeah in  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3195) terms of the actual basic formulation  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3197) yet there is no  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3198) internal yeah i would just qualify and  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3201) say that i don't think  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3203) that  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3204) an orthodox uh doctrine of the trinity  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3208) could be coherent  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3209) yeah so i would probably say that but uh  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3212) can we go to 35 42 but but i guess sorry  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3215) before you go so jake would you agree  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3217) because because you see that's kind of  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3218) the point that just because it can be  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3220) coherent right it can still be highly  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3223) unreasonable and implausible so so you  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3225) can have a coherent model of god's like  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3228) like the partialist model and it can  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3231) have serious problems even if we're  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3232) going to put contradiction aside it  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3234) doesn't necessitate that it's true just  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3235) like the pink elephant example there's  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3237) no incoherence there it doesn't yeah i  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3240) think multiple right yeah i think  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3242) maybe we missed out on something it's  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3244) important uh or maybe we said it but  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3246) anyway because i was trying to get the  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3248) links up but  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3250) something being coherent doesn't entail  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3252) that it's true  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3254) but in order for it to be true it must  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3256) be coherent so it's it's a minimum  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3259) standard of truth but it doesn't  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3261) necessitate that the the concept or the  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3265) proposition or the idea being put  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3267) forward is true but for anything to even  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3271) be possibly true it has to be coherent  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3274) so it's a minimum standard of truth it's  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3276) it's a necessary criteria  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3278) uh but not necessarily a sufficient one  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3282) right and so  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3284) i think that's also something that  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3285) people need to keep in mind but i think  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3288) in the interest of time we ought to go  
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3290) into the next clip what do you say yeah  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3292) yeah there you go  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3293) yeah so sharif you're mentioning um the  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3296) next one is that 35 right okay yeah well  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3301) yeah let me just pull that up so  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3304) all right here we go  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3307) share the screen again  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3310) and  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3312) okay  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3315) so islam says this this is what islam  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3317) says islam says that allah created the  
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3319) world created heaven and hell and  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3321) created human beings with free will to  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3323) the ability to choose and then set to  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3325) human beings that if you freely  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3326) understand all that if you freely choose  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3328) to have belief in good actions you go to  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3329) paradise if you freely choose to commit  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3331) sin and disbelief you go to hellfire  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3333) yeah now on that premise that's why i  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3335) asked you a very specific question on  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3336) that premise what is a logical  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3337) contradiction or is it just an appeal to  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3339) emotion there's no logical contradiction  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3341) at all if you guys believe that i want  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3343) people to go to hell no but what what  
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3345) did i just say here i said god created  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3346) human beings right free will he created  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3348) the universe or a creation with heaven  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3349) and hell right and he god legislated  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3352) notice what he said there is no  
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3354) contradiction but anyway  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3357) that that therefore whoever commits  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3359) disbelief yeah will be assigned to  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3360) health right and who have belief and  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3362) gratitude actions will go right you want  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3363) to focus on the free will of humans and  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3364) i want to focus on the free will of  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3365) allah that's the point  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3366) right so  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3369) yeah i think the two sorry two together  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3371) so you're saying that god could have  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3372) created a universe in which human beings  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3374) only choose to go to paradise no no i'm  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3376) not even saying that i'm saying i'll  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3377) have two choices create or not create so  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3379) let's assume if he creates it would have  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3381) to be exactly what you guys are  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3382) describing that's one option the other  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3384) option is don't create anything okay  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3387) and so if you're a muslim you say oh no  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3389) allah is okay i mean i know that  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3390) language is a problem allah is okay with  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3392) it or he desires it or he wanted to but  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3394) he's not surprised by what happens with  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3395) his creation and so he created knowing  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3397) exactly what would happen that some  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3398) people would end up in hell and you know  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3399) what he created anyhow  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3400) yeah there's no contradiction so the  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3403) contradiction  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3404) so so my goal isn't circles no but i  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3406) think that your goal should be this your  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3408) goal should be to be epistemically  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3409) justified and consistent with the way  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3411) you're trying to build an argument  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3412) building an argument just appealing to  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3414) emotion is not sincere honest well you  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3416) can say sincere and honest in one  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3417) perspective but he's not epistemically  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3419) justified to build an argument just to  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3420) appeal to emotions because we can make  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3422) any argument based upon emotions it then  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3424) becomes my emotions versus somebody  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3425) else's emotions  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3426) you want to have you want to be able to  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3428) treat the other reasons and arguments  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3429) isn't it yeah but  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3435) no notice pine creek's face here sorry  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3437) i'm going to keep playing but just  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3438) notice him zoom in i mean  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3440) he knows what he's doing  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3442) zooming how do i do that brother that's  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3444) above my pay grade  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3448) but then i have you got do you not pinch  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3450) zoom on your laptop you gotta  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3452) okay there that's how it goes  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3454) yeah  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3456) sharif the other problem is that you  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3458) said you were doing an internal critique  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3459) but then  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3460) now so i ought to not do that because  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3462) then i'm probably going to screw things  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3464) up anyway you know he he's he's laughing  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3467) when sharif is pointing out like come on  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3470) man you're appealing to motions here and  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3472) he sort of just admits it but um  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3475) i think we ought to keep playing it go  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3477) ahead tree yeah  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3479) actually i think that's the uh  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3481) oh is that this yeah i think that's  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3482) that's the no there's uh  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3484) what you've got here you've got like  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3487) three and a half more minutes left of  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3489) this oh is it oh okay then go and karen  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3491) yeah if you recall as well before you do  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3494) like i remember pine creek saying um  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3496) something basically along the lines of  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3499) oh they keep appealing to this in the  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3501) same way  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3502) uh  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3503) at the same time thing yeah to get out  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3505) of a contradiction and it's like that's  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3507) exactly what a contradiction is like you  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3509) can't just say oh they're trying to  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3510) appeal to the specific definition of  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3513) what a contradiction is in order to get  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3515) away from what you claim is a  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3516) contradiction is the issue he just wants  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3518) to say it and the issue is is that it's  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3520) not in the same way in the same sense  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3522) and he tries to oversimplify and reduce  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3524) it and i'm guessing this is what's maybe  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3527) going to happen in this next level  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3529) yeah  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3530) exactly okay here we go without that  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3532) being an external critique because  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3534) because of your fundamental  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3535) presupposition of saying well surely  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3537) anybody would agree that this world is  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3538) not as good as this other world now i  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3540) just talked about one little thing i  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3541) said anybody here who wants to spend  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3542) turn in hell raise your hand and i don't  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3544) even admit it earlier you agree okay  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3545) what you mean no we didn't we never said  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3546) oh no we never said see you're confusing  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3548) the difference between an individual  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3549) actually wanting to spend eternity in  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3551) hell versus a world in which hell exists  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3553) the two aren't the same and for you to  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3554) act as if they are the same is a problem  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3557) the bottom line is this there would be  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3558) no disbelief no sin no pain no suffering  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3560) no hell people in hell if allah never  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3561) created and that's something everyone  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3562) here agrees  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3566) the conclusion is that you have a choice  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3568) to worship a god or not that's the  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3570) conclusion yeah you do have a choice and  
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3572) so what and so or overcome or be open to  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3574) the idea that maybe the god you believe  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3575) in doesn't exist maybe there is a god  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3577) not the one you believe in because i  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3579) guarantee you i i guaran this this is  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3581) one claim i'll make i'll guarantee that  
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3583) there's some muslims listening here  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3584) who  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3587) how does that argument be presented  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3589) result in god does not exist or your god  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3590) does not exist no i'm not if your god  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3592) exists then this is what i was going to  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3593) say again to you some muslims who might  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3595) be you know the weak type wavering on  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3596) the fence are going to hear what we're  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3597) discussing and say you know what that  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3599) pine creek kind of makes sense  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3601) it's so frustrating  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3602) please don't use that language yeah uh  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3604) i don't yeah it is yeah hungry what i  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3606) don't understand is where's your  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3607) argument how does it have one doesn't  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3609) happen where's your argument where it is  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3616) so he says the contradict the  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3618) contradiction is allah wants allah  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3620) doesn't want  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3622) and he's  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3623) like he basically he's reducing it to  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3625) that and he's not explaining what it is  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3628) that allah wants because when you start  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3630) basically expanding it and explaining  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3632) what allah doesn't want and what he does  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3636) want then there isn't a contradiction  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3638) and  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3639) this is very important for in order to  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3641) explain the contradiction and he's  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3643) leaving crucial information out in order  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3645) to make it sound like it is so like he  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3648) just reduced it then to allah wants  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3650) allah doesn't want when you say it like  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3652) that it may be but there are we've i've  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3654) given a counter example already where  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3655) there are cases where you can want  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3658) something  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3659) and not want something else  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3662) and still allow the thing that you don't  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3663) want to occur anyway there is no  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3666) necessary contradiction and he he can  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3669) only draw it out by making these uh  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3672) ridiculous oversimplifications and and  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3674) neglecting to mention the conditions  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3677) um which make it not a contradiction  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3679) that is that it has to be  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3681) um  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3682) let me pull up the the actual definition  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3684) of a contradiction  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3685) and so we can just read it  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3691) contradiction  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3699) a logical contradiction is a conjunction  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3701) of a statement s and its denial not s um  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3706) cannot be true uh in the same sense at  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3708) the same time  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3710) so the two statements cannot be true in  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3711) the same sense at the same time when  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3713) we're talking about what allah wants and  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3715) what he doesn't want in this particular  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3717) case it's not in the same sense and it's  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3719) not at the same time so for example we  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3720) can talk about allah doesn't want you to  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3723) disobey  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3725) that you know he wants you to obey his  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3728) laws but he also  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3730) um he wants justice and so he does for  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3733) example want to send people who deserve  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3736) to go to hell to hell  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3738) he can want that  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3740) that's fine he can want justice he can  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3743) desire to send people to hell who  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3745) deserve to go there but he can also want  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3749) and desire for you to have not done that  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3752) but if you do do that then you get the  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3754) consequences there's no contradiction  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3756) here at all it's a completely coherent  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3758) story and  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3760) he  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3761) has to oversimplify it to make an  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3764) apparent contradiction pop in  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3766) but the only way he does that is by  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3767) completely removing all of the  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3769) information  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3770) um that shows that it's not a  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3772) contradiction and then complaining about  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3775) us  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3776) you know using the definition of what a  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3778) contradiction is and pointing out well  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3780) this is important and then he says oh  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3781) they just they throw this in there to  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3783) wiggle it wiggle out of it so no no  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3785) you're throwing things out to wiggle in  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3788) he's basically equivocating on the word  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3791) uh because it's being used in two  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3792) different senses but in the interest of  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3795) time guys because we've got two more  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3796) clips to get to sharif do you mind if i  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3799) go to um ridvan next i think because i  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3801) think pinecones  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3803) yeah  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3804) just to just play that just one more i  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3806) think 30 seconds of uh of pine creek we  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3809) don't need to go to advanced one we'll  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3811) go to a uh iron rod after this  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3814) but yeah okay i mean because the uh  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3816) advance is literally only like a minute  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3818) so that will hurt us  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3820) initially your god does not exist  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3822) because and then you're about to give an  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3823) explanation then you start saying what's  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3824) the most i didn't say that then then you  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3825) said muslims  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3826) now you're saying to me god wants god  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3828) doesn't want that's another that's right  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3831) i've given you an answer a number of  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3832) times and you said okay that makes sense  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3834) it's not internal fatigue then you said  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3835) it's not a logical contradiction  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3837) then you said it's not a logical  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3838) contradiction so what exactly is the  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3840) argument do you understand where the  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3841) frustration is the argument is  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3843) free will did not need to create decided  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3845) to create knowing exactly what would  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3846) happen and it leads some people to hell  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3847) okay so  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3848) sorry hold on what's that what's that  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3850) problem  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3851) his creation leaded to paying evil  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3852) suffering and some people going to hell  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3854) what category is that a logical  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3855) contradiction  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3856) is it an evidentiary no i would say  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3857) that's just i would say that's a logical  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3859) deduction of where the premises lead  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3860) that you believe in a god who created  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3861) knowing what will happen was okay with  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3863) it whatever that means and that led to  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3864) people going to hell but what does that  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3866) mean in terms of your argument against  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3867) islam and against god in general oh god  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3869) oh god that well all i'm pointing out is  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3871) what you believe  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3883) yeah so i mean we got clear there that  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3885) he didn't actually have a contradiction  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3887) now you're just pointing out what we  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3888) believe okay thank you  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3890) i mean have a nice day  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3892) and i think jake also you mentioned in  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3894) that clip as well you said okay you you  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3897) are using your presuppositions and i  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3899) think that's the issue that a lot of  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3901) people don't realize they say that  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3903) they're doing an internal critique but  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3905) what it is they've got their own baggage  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3907) that they're bringing into the  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3908) discussion they have some  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3910) notions about free will they have maybe  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3912) certain notions about god's justice they  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3914) have notions about morality they're  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3916) bringing that in  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3918) and then saying yours is a internal  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3920) contradiction but they're not aware of  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3922) their own  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3923) assumptions that they're bringing into  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3925) the argument  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3927) yeah okay so i'm gonna go to the next  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3930) clip here which is with mr  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3932) uh apostate prophet here it's only a  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3935) minute and a half so here we go  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3938) uh let me let me let me let me ask you  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3940) grab some dust  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3941) yeah because this is that  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3943) that is incoherent i think that is  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3944) completely no no no no because it makes  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3945) sense actually punishing them for uh the  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3947) way he created them knowing exactly that  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3950) this is what their nature in which he  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3951) created them uh  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3954) what they would do what would happen to  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3955) them eventually but uh let me let me let  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3957) me let me ask you that just  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3959) yeah because this is that that is  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3961) incoherent so i think that is completely  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3963) no no because it makes sense so he's  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3964) making a claim that it's incoherent now  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3966) let's see if he if he actually  
[1:06:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3968) substantiates that this your packaging  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3971) is as if it's a logical contradiction  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3973) but  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3974) it's sounding like i'm saying it's  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3976) incoherent  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3980) by the way for people who don't know  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3981) when you say it's incoherent and it's  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3983) contradictory they're not two different  
[1:06:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3986) things guys they're referring in this  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3988) context to the same thing i know that  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3991) there is a fellow that i spoke to that  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3993) somehow thought there was a  
[1:06:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3995) significant difference but there  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=3998) actually isn't buts yeah so uh yusuf was  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4000) right to press on that point and  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4002) i don't know what apostle prophet was  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4003) thinking but here we go saying that you  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4005) said that but the meat and potatoes of  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4007) it is is that this it sounds more like a  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4009) moral claim it sounds more like you're  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4012) saying this it is not  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4013) it is not then you need to show then you  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4015) need to show what's the logical country  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4017) you haven't shown that there needs to be  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4019) you need to give premise one which is a  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4021) so the quran or the sunnah says a and  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4024) then premise two it also says b  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4027) and b is the negation of a so b is not a  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4031) it's a very  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4038) that's a rigid way to approach it  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4040) exactly  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4041) he doesn't want that he doesn't want an  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4043) actual contradiction he just wants to  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4046) formulate his own argument and not be  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4048) contradictory this is the type of people  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4050) that unfortunately we're dealing with  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4052) we're discussing and it i don't know if  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4055) it was purposeful um but it just so  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4058) happens that three of the clips that  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4059) we're gonna pay play are from atheists  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4062) you have mr icky uh mr irrelevant and  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4065) then um  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4066) mr necessary dean i guess i'm just  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4068) coming over that on the spot aaron raw  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4070) which we'll see next and it's just we're  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4073) not  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4074) i don't think it's intentional to pick  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4075) on atheists because we see christians do  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4077) this and even muslims can be guilty of  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4080) it as as well but it just so happened  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4082) that um this is what we came up with but  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4084) let me just finish i think there's like  
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4086) 30 seconds left a contradiction is  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4091) it is incoherent that allah creates  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4094) human beings  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4096) that he says that they are fully  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4099) responsible for their actions although  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4101) he creates them  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4103) with their capabilities and with their  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4105) nature  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4106) uh  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4108) and then he decides to punish them  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4111) because they do not believe in him he's  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4114) struggling  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4118) because they chose their free will which  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4120) he gave to them in the very beginning it  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4121) showed he gave them free will and they  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4122) use this free will in the wrong way  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4124) which is why he will punish them forever  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4127) and this was their own fault yes and  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4130) they committed  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4140) you can see it in ap's face as well as  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4143) he's doing it he was struggling brother  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4147) [Music]  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4151) he's laughing man he's like i'm loving  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4154) this  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4159) and look at you as well i mean the same  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4161) thing you've got going on  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4163) because i had to see what was going on  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4165) in his head like you could see him sort  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4166) of like  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4167) starting to realize that he doesn't have  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4169) what he suggested  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4171) and i'm just like i don't know what i  
[1:09:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4172) was doing i was probably looking at  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4174) something else  
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4175) yeah  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4177) you're giving him the death star yeah  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4180) that's that's why he's getting nervous i  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4182) think because you eyeballing it  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4184) it's a really good example because he's  
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4186) he on the one hand he's saying it's  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4187) incoherent then we're saying well if  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4190) you're saying he's incoherent it has to  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4191) be a logical contradiction he said no no  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4193) no no it's just incoherent yeah  
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4195) then he's saying it's too rigid uh you  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4198) know having the criteriological  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4199) contradiction  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4200) then you know you're saying well you're  
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4202) bringing in your presuppositions about  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4204) what morality is you say no no no i'm  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4206) not yeah i'm doing internal contra  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4209) internal critique and yet the internal  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4211) critique doesn't result  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4213) in a logical contradiction so it just is  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4217) it's just a good example in terms of you  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4219) know  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4220) people  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4221) using words which have colloquial  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4223) meanings but not understanding how it's  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4225) used technically  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4226) yeah and it's also really expressive of  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4228) this huge frustration because it's these  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4230) very same individuals accused theists of  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4233) being irrational and you know they don't  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4238) they don't know anything about logic and  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4239) this that and the other and and then  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4241) when it comes to talking to people who  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4242) have been trained in it and are familiar  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4244) with the terminology and understand what  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4246) it means  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4248) like they  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4249) throw it out the window all of a sudden  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4251) it's like you know  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4252) actually trying to study these things is  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4255) superfluous in some way or like  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4257) yeah yeah it's it's it's really really  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4259) frustrating it's it's  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4261) one of my pet peeves  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4263) yeah that was a good one i i like that  
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4264) one the last one is is mr uh necessary  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4268) being aaron rah  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4269) it's about three minutes this is the  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4271) last clip and then we're gonna go to  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4273) uh audience if you guys have any  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4275) questions or comments maybe points of  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4278) clarification whether or not this is a  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4280) contradiction or it's not um things that  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4283) you want to discuss it'll be open to  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4285) pretty much anybody so uh yusuf if you  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4287) could post the link to the stream and  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4289) and pin it as a message uh while i'm  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4292) playing this last clip that would be  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4293) appreciated inshallah  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4296) all right so here we go  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4298) you're looking for a way to disprove  
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4300) leprechauns and the point that you're  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4302) missing is that there's no reason to  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4304) believe leprechauns that's two separate  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4305) issues there's two separate issues  
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4309) yeah that's right you need to have a  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4310) reason to believe something that's one  
[1:11:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4311) thing the second thing is having an  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4312) understanding that something is  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4313) impossible  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4314) those are two separate issues okay now  
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4316) what abdullah is explaining he's saying  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4317) that look if you just have an absence of  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4318) evidence of x it doesn't mean x doesn't  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4320) exist so if i turn around and i say x  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4322) does not exist it means that i'm making  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4324) a positive claim now what abdul said he  
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4326) said that to make that positive claim  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4328) that x does not exist one of the ways  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4329) would be to say well if x existed i  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4331) would see this evidence if this evidence  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4334) doesn't exist therefore that justifies  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4336) me saying that x does not exist so he's  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4338) asking the same question because you're  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4340) in a position where you made a hard  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4341) atheist claim that god doesn't exist  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4343) what was my heart atheist claim so the  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4344) heart ate his heart atheism i that god  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4346) is does not exist that's your position  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4348) not that i don't believe in god because  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4350) of lack of evidence that's soft atheist  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4352) claim but he's a heart attack so what  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4353) everybody's asking is a very specific  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4354) question he's saying look if you're  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4355) making this claim that god does not  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4356) exist x does not exist yeah you have to  
[1:12:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4359) either demonstrate that if god existed  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4361) or existed we would see this evidence  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4363) because we don't see this evidence then  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4364) i can discount god yeah so you have to  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4366) say you have to explain what i've done  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4367) specifically you have to explain what  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4369) that evidence is that we would expect  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4371) such that it doesn't exist leading us to  
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4373) the conclusion that god doesn't exist  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4375) well i feel like repeating myself an  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4376) awful lot and you're asking questions  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4378) i've already answered but he's never  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4380) answered it and sharif's question is if  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4382) you're going to take a hard atheist  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4384) position and say that god does not exist  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4388) right  
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4389) uh which i think  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4391) if memory serves me correct it may not  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4392) be in this clip in particular but i  
[1:13:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4394) think  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4395) iron rod does say that it's god existing  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4398) is impossible uh and i think that's kind  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4400) of yeah there's something clear and  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4402) yeah oh it's actually interesting he's  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4404) gonna say it no no no he he didn't say  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4406) it's impossible he said it's not a  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4408) possibility which is apparently a  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4410) different thing okay well anyway  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4412) so it's impossible for god to exist  
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4415) that's what it results in him claim  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4416) making that claim and when you say that  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4419) you have to then reduce the claim to of  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4422) god's existence  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4424) to  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4424) a logical impossibility and and this is  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4427) what uh what do you call it sharif is is  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4430) trying to get him  
[1:13:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4433) to see at this point and aren't raw's  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4435) response is well i feel like i'm talking  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4437) in circles well you're you're not really  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4439) talking at all my brother sorry to tell  
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4441) you but anyway there's about a minute  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4443) left so let's go  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4444) we don't have a possibility we start  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4446) with that  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4446) oh we don't have a possibility there you  
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4448) go uh and it's not just that we don't  
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4450) have the possibilities things are  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4451) defined in reverse i mean you want to  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4453) imagine that that somehow the mind  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4455) exists outside of the brain there's no  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4457) support for mind body dualism whatsoever  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4459) uh yeah but you're assuming that that  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4460) consciousness pre-exists matter and and  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4463) there's no logical conclusion that would  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4464) lead to to any of the gods that men have  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4466) ever devised when you look at the  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4467) entirety of the cosmos there's just no  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4468) way to conclude that this thing  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4471) cares that much about the skin on the  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4472) tip of our penis if it created 11  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4474) jillion galaxies and so forth there's  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4476) there's not a possibility for him to how  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4478) does he control whether your team wins  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4480) the game or whether you find your keys  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4481) how does he manipulate matter and  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4483) believers will commonly tell me that you  
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4484) know that god helped them in matters  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4486) like this but in that case god had to  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4488) manipulate other people's minds control  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4490) other people's free will in order to  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4492) you know manipulate everything to these  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4493) ends and they're just not thinking this  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4494) through so what i need is we need to  
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4496) show that there's a there there or we  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4498) literally have nothing to talk about  
[1:14:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4499) yeah so  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4500) so sharif i don't know if you want to  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4502) listen to your response because you got  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4504) to stop there i don't think it's needed  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4506) right no it's not needed no yeah so the  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4508) point is is that he didn't reduce uh the  
[1:15:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4511) claim to a contradiction he talked about  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4514) whether or not god cares if you're  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4516) circumcised or which  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4518) is it says nothing about whether or not  
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4521) the belief is is contradictory he he  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4524) talked about the fact that there's no  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4526) evidence while him again just asserting  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4528) that there's no evidence doesn't prove  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4531) that the existence of god is impossible  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4533) which was sharif and i think abdul's  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4535) point as well that the absence of  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4537) evidence isn't necessarily  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4540) evidence of absence you have to show  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4542) therefore  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4543) what sharif was trying to say  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4545) that if god exists necessarily we would  
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4548) find this we don't find that therefore  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4551) necessarily god doesn't exist  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4553) i think that kind of either went over  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4556) the poor fellow's head or he did  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4558) understand it but he just  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4560) couldn't answer it so went on about i  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4562) don't know on this other thing talking  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4564) about circumcision which is  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4566) see whether or not god cares if you're  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4568) circumcised doesn't say anything about  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4571) his existence there's no contradiction  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4574) there at all  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4576) so again it's another case of  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4578) someone like aaron raw who  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4581) you know subhanallah has a lot of people  
[1:16:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4583) following him and the guy doesn't even  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4585) know what a contradiction is  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4587) so  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4588) that was rather unfortunate but if you  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4590) guys have got any  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4592) comments on that uh that was the last  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4594) clip  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4596) sharif abdul  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4597) uh no i do i don't know abdullah wants  
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4600) to jump in i just want to see something  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4603) as well because yeah we could send in  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4605) the link the thing is a lot of these oh  
[1:16:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4607) youssef didn't do it  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4610) did did you sign the link or no  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4613) yusuf are you there  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4615) okay i'm gonna do it then  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4617) i thought he was gonna take care of that  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4618) from me yeah so i just want to say a lot  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4620) a lot of these guys that we talked to  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4621) like these three guys we just uh the  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4623) clips we just showed  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4625) the problem is a lot of times they they  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4627) undermine the value of philosophy and  
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4628) they say that we approach it from a  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4629) different angle but it's important to  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4632) know that logic is like foundational to  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4634) any kind of thought to any kind of  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4637) intellectual you know uh um you know uh  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4639) practice so whatever angle you approach  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4642) it from  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4643) even if aaron raw is gonna talk about uh  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4645) you know evolution or if ap is going to  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4648) talk about you know  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4650) immoral the immoral things that he finds  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4653) in the quran from his subjective uh  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4656) perspective  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4657) then  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4658) in doing that you're going to use  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4660) reasoning and logic in order to make  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4662) your case  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4663) they speak as if you know  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4665) let's put logic and philosophy aside and  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4667) talk about something else as if we don't  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4669) need logic and philosophy in order to  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4671) talk about whatever it is you're going  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4673) to talk about so that's that's just the  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4675) funny part and and  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4676) it's it's strange that it comes from  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4678) people with huge followings and uh you  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4680) know huge influences  
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4684) yep i think we've got uh thinker man  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4688) here waiting so let me add him to the  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4690) stream  
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4692) hey how's it going  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4694) hey i'm doing great how are you guys  
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4697) we're good uh good  
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4699) um i'll do by the way if you could just  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4700) talk to him because i'm going to try to  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4702) get the link pinned in there i have to  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4704) sign out of my youtube account and do a  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4706) whole thing so  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4707) for sure sure  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4709) hey thank you man what's up it's been a  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4710) couple of days  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4712) yeah it's always fun talking to you guys  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4715) so yeah same here  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4718) uh my position used to be that there was  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4720) no internal contradiction in islam  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4724) but  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4724) then i sort of delve deeper into the  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4727) free will issue and i i've talked to  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4729) this before with you as well and  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4732) at least for now i'm convinced that that  
[1:18:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4735) is an internal contradiction  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4737) and if you want to talk about it sure so  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4740) so i mean based on if you've been  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4741) listening to what we've said can you uh  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4744) basically present your case for why  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4745) there's a contradiction  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4748) okay so the type of free will i'm saying  
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4750) is one the one that includes moral  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4752) responsibility  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4754) so for i think it's important that we  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4756) define what we mean by moral  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4758) responsibility and free will because if  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4760) you have different definitions like  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4761) compatibilist definitions then my  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4763) argument just falls apart because i'm  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4765) talking mostly about libertarian free  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4767) will  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4769) so by uh  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4771) by  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4772) the free will and moral responsibility i  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4774) mean that a you could have you had the  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4776) ability to do otherwise  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4778) and b that you had uh  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4781) ultimate control over over the over your  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4784) choices  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4786) okay  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4787) okay so uh so either  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4791) your uh  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4792) your choices have a cause uh then  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4795) those causes are deterministic in which  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4797) case that's not libertarian free will  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4799) right so in  
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4801) uh so we have to add in indeterminacy  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4805) and that means you're the reason why you  
[1:20:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4807) chose a rather than b has no cause  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4810) and  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4811) if it has no cause then the cause can  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4813) our explanation can't be that you chose  
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4815) it  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4816) and made it such can i can i can i just  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4819) can i just try to help you out here with  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4820) with the argument just let me know if  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4823) this is what you're going to say at the  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4824) end of the day so in order to be more  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4827) morally accountable  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4829) you must be able to uh you know  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4832) choose your act you must be able to to  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4834) to choose what you're doing we cannot  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4837) choose our act therefore we cannot be  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4839) morally accountable something like that  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4842) yeah you can't exert control in such a  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4844) manner that you bring about one action  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4846) rather than  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4848) okay so so um  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4851) we we discussed this a few times but i  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4853) think there's still a problem with you  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4855) saying there's no cause for a free  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4857) choice because we agreed that it's not  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4859) really we're not really talking about an  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4861) a-causal mechanism we're talking about a  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4864) uh  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4865) primitive mechanism that on a  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4867) libertarian view might be arbitrary but  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4870) it's not a causal um  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4873) what what you want to say from me  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4875) speaking to you i mean i understand your  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4876) position is that considering  
[1:21:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4879) there is no explanation for you know why  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4882) you would choose one choice over another  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4885) on a libertarian view therefore it is  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4888) completely arbitrary and  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4890) whatever instance you're put in  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4893) uh  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4893) it's just you and your luck you know  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4895) whatever choice that's going on i don't  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4897) even think he's saying that  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4898) i think he's saying  
[1:21:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4900) the idea i think he's saying the idea is  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4902) contradictory  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4905) uh what he's saying because i spoke to  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4906) him a few times what he's saying is that  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4908) because it is arbitrary because i i  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4910) tried to dig this out of him but i don't  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4911) think it is arbitrary i wouldn't even  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4913) use that word  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4914) i i'm not comfortable with that  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4916) um i mean  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4918) i think at the end i mean i i would i  
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4920) would use the word arbitrary for a true  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4922) libertarian choice i mean the choice  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4924) itself i wouldn't say that there's no  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4926) you know a platform there for to do  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4929) causal work to like ground the free  
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4931) choice i think it's grounded but i think  
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4934) the particular choice in turn yeah but  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4936) arbitraries i'm looking it up based on  
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4939) random choice or personal  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4941) whim rather than any reason  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4944) yeah that that that it has this negative  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4946) connotation to it but i don't mean in  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4948) that way what what i mean is that  
[1:22:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4949) there's no external explanation that  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4952) accounts for these specific choice it is  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4956) basically primitive is a better word so  
[1:22:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4957) the choice is primitive  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4959) and what yeah but it's not without any  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4962) reason  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4963) yeah there so so yeah again we discussed  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4965) this so there are reasons that don't  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4967) basically entail the choice  
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4969) what he wants to say which i want to  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4971) grant him is that the choice itself  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4974) whether it goes right or left  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4977) in  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4978) on on a non-deterministic model is going  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4980) to be something that's considering it's  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4983) not entailed by the reasons it's going  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4985) to be something that's arbitrary right  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4988) and uh  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4989) what i i want to agree with that i want  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4991) to say that the choice is primitive i  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4992) just think that  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4994) that negative connotation is coming with  
[1:23:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4996) that  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=4997) you know it being arbitrary means that  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5000) it's just randomly happening happening  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5002) is not true because it is primitive in  
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5004) the sense that it comes from the agent  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5007) what else do you want for moral  
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5008) accountability  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5010) whatever the choice is going to be  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5012) whatever possible world you're looking  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5014) at  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5014) on a libertarian view the idea that an  
[1:23:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5017) agent could have done otherwise  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5020) does not mean that what the agent does  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5023) is  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5024) you know he's compelled to do it's  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5026) actually quite the opposite that  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5028) whatever the agent does  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5030) that act that free act is always going  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5032) to be  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5033) from within the free agent and it's  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5035) always going to be primitive i don't  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5037) think it's this a causal mechanism  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5039) that's just random and you know just  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5042) relies on luck  
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5043) so that that's the first problem i have  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5045) with your argument that you're assuming  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5048) that you know there there needs to be  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5050) this extra component but i i just i  
[1:24:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5053) haven't seen you make a case for that  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5055) because considering the act comes from  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5057) internally from the agent i don't know  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5059) what else you want for moral  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5061) accountability the second and bigger  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5063) problem i have with your argument is why  
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5067) should we accept your standard for what  
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5069) moral accountability is when you  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5072) i mean i'm you you've spoken to me about  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5073) this you don't really have an objective  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5075) standard for what it is so i think the  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5077) biggest the biggest point i mentioned to  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5079) you was the last time i spoke to you i  
[1:24:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5080) told you listen  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5081) you can't have it both ways if you're  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5083) going to say that free will is an  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5084) incoherent concept and it can't you  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5087) can't we can't be held morally  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5089) accountable because we can't be truly  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5092) free in in the sense that you want us to  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5094) be then you believe the same about god's  
[1:24:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5096) free will  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5097) so if if you believe the same about  
[1:24:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5099) god's free will then you can't hold god  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5102) morally accountable for holding us  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5103) morally accountable so your argument  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5105) falls apart god can do whatever he wants  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5107) in that sense right so i guess the crux  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5110) of the issue here is for me let's assume  
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5112) i accept your understanding of  
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5114) libertarian free will you would say it  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5116) applies to god so whatever will or free  
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5119) will god has it is  
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5121) similarly you can't expect from you  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5124) can't expect to hold god morally  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5126) accountable for his acts but it seems  
[1:25:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5128) you are by saying that you know we  
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5131) shouldn't be accountable he shouldn't  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5132) hold us accountable uh do you see the  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5134) inconsistency there  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5137) yeah i do and uh i remember you  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5139) mentioned at this point  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5140) last time as well and uh  
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5142) it was unfortunate i think for some  
[1:25:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5144) reason  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5145) either i went out or you went out and i  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5147) wasn't able to respond so i'll do it now  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5149) because i have thought about what you  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5151) said  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5152) so  
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5153) when you say that the choice comes for  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5155) you  
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5157) from you so who else is responsible  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5160) uh so that goes back to us defining free  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5162) will and moral responsibility  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5164) i said that it has to be something that  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5166) you could have done otherwise and that  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5168) you had ultimate control over it so  
[1:26:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5171) let's say if i'm sitting and  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5173) somewhere from my body let's say my face  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5176) starts sweating okay  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5178) and i didn't choose to make it sweat but  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5180) it is from me that the sweat emerges but  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5183) i'm not morally responsible for the  
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5185) sweat emerging because i didn't have any  
[1:26:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5187) control over whether my forehead starts  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5190) to sweat or not so and the reason why  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5192) it's a problem is is because if it's  
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5195) truly arbitrary the way you say then it  
[1:26:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5197) then you did not exert any control over  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5200) bringing it about in such a way it's  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5202) like you one uh once you  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5204) at a time i remember you said that it's  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5206) something that happens to you  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5208) so that's that's my uh response to your  
[1:26:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5211) first objection and then the second one  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5213) about about god  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5216) i think  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5216) i'm sticking on the first one first but  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5219) i mean how is it in august because i  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5221) think they're two completely different  
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5222) situations so in the case of sweating  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5224) you're right  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5225) the whatever made you sweat is you know  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5227) an external force that affected you and  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5229) basically deterministically led to you  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5232) sweating but but when we talk about free  
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5235) will we're saying the opposite we're  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5236) saying it's an internal mechanism and  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5238) whatever so if if sweating is what it is  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5240) basically you chose to sweat uh so  
[1:27:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5243) whatever free act you do is an internal  
[1:27:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5245) mechanism and right now you're trying to  
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5247) make that analogous to something to an  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5249) external force acting upon you i don't i  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5252) don't see how you can do that  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5255) uh so what i was saying but what i meant  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5257) was that  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5258) whether it's something that internal to  
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5260) you  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5261) or something external  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5263) the point is that you had no control in  
[1:27:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5265) bringing it about it's sort of like  
[1:27:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5267) something that happened to you instead  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5268) of something that you consciously  
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5270) reasoned and brought it about  
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5273) but but uh but we agree so last time we  
[1:27:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5276) spoke as well we agreed that it's the  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5277) agent i mean so this primitive free  
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5280) choice is  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5281) the agent's choice the free will  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5284) is coming from the agent it's not like  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5285) free will is this separate thing  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5288) right that produces these random choices  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5290) and i'm an agent that's you know  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5293) uh uh not part of the free will and it's  
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5296) just imposing its choices on me i am  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5298) that machine right i am making these  
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5301) choices so it's it's primitive and it's  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5303) internal so i still see a problem with  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5306) what you're saying  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5309) uh  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5310) i'll try to explain it  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5311) one more time maybe maybe i'm not doing  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5313) it rightly so let's say you're a machine  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5317) who's built in such a manner that you  
[1:28:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5319) randomly jump push out numbers okay  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5321) let's say some numbers are good and some  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5323) numbers are bad and you can't help  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5326) but randomly push them out you can never  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5328) consciously in a controlled fashion  
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5331) bring about a certain number they have  
[1:28:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5333) to be arbitrary  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5334) so if a good number jumps out  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5337) then you won't really be morally  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5338) responsible for it because all you can  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5340) do is just randomly push out numbers so  
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5343) similarly we're a machine that randomly  
[1:29:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5345) pushes out choices because i think we've  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5347) agreed that their choices are arbitrary  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5350) because if we say that there's a reason  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5352) then that would be an explanation that  
[1:29:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5354) and that would require a further  
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5355) explanation so i think we've agreed that  
[1:29:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5357) no we're not denying there's a reason  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5358) and that's that's i think that's what  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5360) the good point jake brought up i mean  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5361) i'm not  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5362) using arbitrary with that negative  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5364) connotation that it comes with i'm just  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5365) saying that there's no way that that's  
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5367) our relationship and then it kills it  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5369) yeah i agree with you so because it does  
[1:29:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5370) have a negative connotation but then the  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5372) the reasons there are reasons for  
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5374) choices i think her man is just that the  
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5376) reasons don't entail the choice do you  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5379) get the difference  
[1:29:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5380) i i get it but i think you were correct  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5382) in saying that ultimately why you made  
[1:29:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5385) that choice that that itself does not  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5388) have a reason so let's say choice a as  
[1:29:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5390) reasons one two three choice b has  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5392) reasons four five six  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5394) and now you have to decide what to do  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5397) whether you choose a for reasons one two  
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5399) three or you choose b for reasons four  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5401) five six that itself has no reason why  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5404) you chose one or the other but that's  
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5405) what libertarian free will is you're  
[1:30:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5407) just talking about what libertarian free  
[1:30:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5409) will is you're not pointing out how it's  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5412) contradictory or incoherent  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5414) it's contradictory in the sense that the  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5416) main thing is that why you chose a  
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5418) rather than b and that thing has what's  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5420) the contradiction  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5422) you you did it for no reason you did it  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5424) it's sort of you can say random you can  
[1:30:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5426) say chansey you can say it's something  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5428) no you can't you don't you can't those  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5430) primitives  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5431) yeah those are all things that you're  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5433) adding on that they're not part of  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5435) libertarian free will  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5437) that's just your assessment  
[1:30:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5440) so would you say that you had any  
[1:30:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5442) control  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5443) yes like that's what libertarian free  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5446) will is it just means to have a reason  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5448) to do something but the reason not be  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5450) necessitating and say that i did this  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5453) over this and i could have done this  
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5455) other thing  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5457) there's nothing incoherent about it  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5459) there's  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5460) right there's the contradiction  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5462) where where's the contradiction  
[1:31:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5465) so if  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5466) like i said before  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5467) i'm not saying that  
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5469) there aren't reasons to do things i'm  
[1:31:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5471) saying that the why you pick one choice  
[1:31:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5473) over another that itself has no reason  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5475) if you say there's a reason what's  
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5477) incoherent about that that's the  
[1:31:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5479) question  
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5480) okay do we agree that  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5482) that that part has no reason  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5484) are we in agreement there  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5486) yeah because  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5488) his his the incoherence is elsewhere for  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5490) him so i'm saying even if i do grant  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5491) that there's still no incoherence  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5493) because what you want to say is because  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5494) of that  
[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5495) then you're not morally accountable i  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5498) just don't see how that follows no but i  
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5500) i disagree he's saying the incoherence  
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5503) is right here before you even get to  
[1:31:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5505) moral accountability he's saying the  
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5507) very concept i don't think so no i think  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5510) what he's trying to say is that because  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5511) it's just random and chancy you can't be  
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5513) accountable for what you do yeah exactly  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5515) but it's predicated on the idea that it  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5517) is random and chancy it's not  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5520) yeah yeah yeah i mean so those terms  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5523) i think i i tried several times to tell  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5525) you let's not use the words random  
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5526) enchancy so let's let's say that the  
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5529) choice is primitive right we're not  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5531) saying that it's not grounded in an  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5532) agent but i i  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5535) the problem is what you're you're saying  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5537) that it follows from  
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5539) you know the the arbitrariness of free  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5542) will that the agent is not accountable i  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5544) just don't see how you can make that  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5546) case because you have to say that the  
[1:32:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5548) choice is an internal primitive  
[1:32:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5553) aspect of the agent it's not from  
[1:32:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5555) anywhere else so if there is any  
[1:32:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5557) accountability at all where else is it  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5558) going to come from there's nothing  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5560) external to the agent acting on the  
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5561) agent making making him do he's he's  
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5564) acting  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5565) himself it's not randomly just it's and  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5568) the machine example you gave isn't a  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5569) very good one because yeah but  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5571) we know there's a mechanism that's just  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5573) you know imposed on the machine but  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5575) we're thinking of an agent that has the  
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5578) ability to make these primitive you know  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5581) who has this primitive faculty of free  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5583) will and is able to make libertarian  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5585) choices  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5586) if you're saying the incoherence is  
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5588) there i i don't see it if you want to  
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5591) say that that entails that he's not  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5593) morally accountable i can see more of a  
[1:33:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5595) case for that but i just don't see any  
[1:33:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5597) logical entailment especially when you  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5600) don't really have an objective standard  
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5601) to tell us what it is to be morally  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5603) accountable  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5605) right do you think that you can be in  
[1:33:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5607) control of something that happens for no  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5609) reason  
[1:33:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5611) no  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5612) right and  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5615) we've so  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5615) haven't we already admitted that  
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5618) uh  
[1:33:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5619) you're choosing a rather than b has no  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5621) reason  
[1:33:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5622) no choosing a rather than b is is is an  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5625) internal it's a choice  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5627) it's within yourself  
[1:33:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5628) yeah and the reason why you make that  
[1:33:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5630) choice why why a rather than b it has to  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5633) be it has to have no reason because if  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5635) it has a reason then that must have a  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5637) reason and that must have reason and  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5639) somewhere down the line  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5642) jake just explained that there's a  
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5644) reason but it's not necessitating i mean  
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5646) yeah we're spinning circles thinker you  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5648) can make your final comment and then  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5650) we're gonna have to move on next people  
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5651) person  
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5654) okay uh so i'll just make the final  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5657) comment then  
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5658) i i understand that there are reasons  
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5661) for choices but what the thing that  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5663) doesn't have an explanation  
[1:34:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5665) is  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5666) why did you choose a rather than b so  
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5668) some people like say you have an ability  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5670) to choose but that ability to choose is  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5673) consistent with you choosing b rather  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5675) than a  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5676) not a rather than b there has to be some  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5679) explanation for why you chose a rather  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5680) than b and that if that point has no  
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5683) explanation then the explanation can  
[1:34:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5685) never be that you controlled it or you  
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5687) chose it because  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5688) because we're already granting that it  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5690) has no explanation so you guys can  
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5692) counter it and uh  
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5694) and i think  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5695) so you you're what you're doing is  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5697) you're trying to press  
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5699) uh a hard version of the psr but i'm  
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5702) just wondering if you would actually be  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5704) consistent with that and i i i would  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5706) actually argue that probably not  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5711) right so because what is your  
[1:35:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5713) explanation for why the universe exists  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5716) or why anything at all exists  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5719) so i i don't think that's really even  
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5721) relevant it is relevant because yeah  
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5723) what i'm saying is you're not consistent  
[1:35:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5725) with your own thing because when we  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5727) actually get down to it you're probably  
[1:35:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5729) going to appeal to some type of  
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5731) bruteness  
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5732) yeah but nobody i won't say that  
[1:35:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5734) anybody's responsible for that brute  
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5736) fact existing no no but no because  
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5738) you're you're saying that that in and of  
[1:35:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5741) itself is is incoherent  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5743) no no no no no i've never said that  
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5745) brute facts existing are incoherent i'm  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5748) saying somebody being responsible  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5750) for a brute fact is incoherent because  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5752) the brute fact necessarily has no  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5754) explanation you're not because the  
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5755) person is in control of it you're saying  
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5758) that he's not in control because there's  
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5759) not a further explanation  
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5762) yeah so something you can't be so if if  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5764) he were in control of it and he chose it  
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5766) then that's an explanation  
[1:36:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5768) yeah him choosing it is the explanation  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5771) that's the point yeah and that would  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5773) lead to further questions as to why  
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5775) would why did he choose that no it  
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5777) doesn't it doesn't lead to further  
[1:36:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5779) questions that's the point it's  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5780) primitive yeah thinker man i think  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5782) because because we have to move on but  
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5784) then i think that just the the main idea  
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5786) is is this i don't think you do have a  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5788) problem with group contingencies but  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5790) then you have a problem with first of  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5792) all your conception of libertarian free  
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5793) will because you're signing you're  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5794) trying to distinguish between the agent  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5796) and the choice for some reason as if the  
[1:36:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5797) choice is this random thing that happens  
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5799) it's imposed on the agent but the agent  
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5801) is making the choice the fact that you  
[1:36:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5803) know you don't have some sort of  
[1:36:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5805) necessitating explanation for the choice  
[1:36:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5807) doesn't mean that it's not internal from  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5809) within the agent and also i think the  
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5811) bigger issue with this is that if we're  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5813) going to deny free will altogether  
[1:36:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5815) what i said earlier about you know  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5816) you're going to have to say the same  
[1:36:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5817) thing about god and how he's not morally  
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5819) accountable so him holding us morally  
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5821) accountable when he shouldn't according  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5823) to your standards is not really a  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5825) problem so um i guess i guess you could  
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5828) think about that and then we can discuss  
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5829) it uh you know some other time and not  
[1:37:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5831) only that one last thing to add is that  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5834) from an islamic paradigm it's not  
[1:37:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5836) necessarily wedded to libertarian free  
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5839) will so  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5840) that that's the other thing that you're  
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5842) also assuming that islam has an internal  
[1:37:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5845) contradiction but you can actually be a  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5848) compatibilist and be a muslim so  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5851) i just don't see on and really any way  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5854) that you slice it even if you granted  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5856) your entire argument  
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5858) how it would be an internal  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5859) contradiction  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5862) so it would it would be an internal  
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5864) contradiction in that if we  
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5867) if you if you believe that you could not  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5869) have done otherwise and then  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5871) then god would be unjust so no no no it  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5874) wouldn't because then again you're no  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5876) longer doing an internal critique you're  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5878) then  
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5879) therefore saying that you can't believe  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5881) in a compatibilist understanding of free  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5884) will and also be accountable and that's  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5886) a further argument that you would have  
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5888) to make  
[1:38:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5890) so anyway we're gonna have to go buddy  
[1:38:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5892) i'm sorry we're gonna have to go to the  
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5894) next person because  
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5897) next time take care thanks  
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5900) thanks all right we've got uh sean here  
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5903) next  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5904) so how you doing hey welcome guys  
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5908) how's it going  
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5909) good man i just wanted to say before i  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5911) start um i really want to thank you guys  
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5913) for all the work that you do  
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5915) i really appreciate everything i'm i've  
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5917) learned so much from you guys  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5920) i'm doing now appreciate that glad to  
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5922) have you here  
[1:38:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5923) thanks man so um my first uh question i  
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5926) guess i would say is  
[1:38:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5928) is holding that okay  
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5930) if you are an atheist and you believe  
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5932) that the universe operates  
[1:38:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5935) just physical stuff chemistry and  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5937) physics and that's it  
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5939) is it a contradiction to believe that  
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5941) and believe that you have free will  
[1:39:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5945) i think we're probably all in agreement  
[1:39:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5947) here and i would say yes abdul if you  
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5949) want to talk you got to bring your your  
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5951) mic down  
[1:39:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5954) [Music]  
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5955) i wasn't talking though but yeah i know  
[1:39:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5957) but you were you were before when sean  
[1:39:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5959) first came on and you were muted yeah  
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5961) yeah yeah so i mean i i would agree it's  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5963) a contradiction clearly we'd have to do  
[1:39:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5965) some work to show how it is but i think  
[1:39:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5967) yes it yeah i i would just say i think  
[1:39:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5969) sean that on a materialistic paradigm  
[1:39:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5974) where you like you said that  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5976) everything is just matter and motion so  
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5978) to speak  
[1:39:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5979) seems like a deterministic world view or  
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5982) even if you think at the quantum level  
[1:39:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5985) that there's some type of indeterminacy  
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5987) it's still outside of  
[1:39:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5989) human beings control  
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5991) and if that's the case then yeah it's  
[1:39:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5994) very difficult to see how anybody would  
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5996) have free will  
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=5998) okay and so based on that  
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6001) um would you say that a mechanism like  
[1:40:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6004) if we are just a mechanism so to speak  
[1:40:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6007) can we be morally  
[1:40:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6010) accountable so for example if a thunder  
[1:40:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6012) of a lightning bolt strikes  
[1:40:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6015) a forest and creates a forest fire that  
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6017) causes a lot of harm  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6019) is that lightning bolt  
[1:40:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6021) considered bad or evil  
[1:40:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6023) no of course not yeah so i see what  
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6025) you're saying yeah so it's like the  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6027) previous guy that came on  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6030) if he thinks everything's deterministic  
[1:40:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6031) and this is something i mentioned to him  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6033) not in this conversation but i spoke to  
[1:40:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6034) him another time i think it was on  
[1:40:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6036) clubhouse  
[1:40:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6038) um  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6039) how would you deal with moral  
[1:40:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6040) accountability from a secularist  
[1:40:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6043) paradigm why are we throwing certain  
[1:40:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6046) people in prison and for how long and  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6048) you know all of that type of stuff  
[1:40:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6051) seems to  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6052) cast doubt on the very idea of moral  
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6055) accountability it just seems like oh  
[1:40:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6057) well we don't like these people because  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6059) this happened and so we're going to  
[1:41:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6061) punish them but they couldn't have done  
[1:41:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6063) otherwise just like you said it's just  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6064) like a a plant uh growing a leaf is the  
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6068) same thing as  
[1:41:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6070) somebody deciding to murder somebody uh  
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6072) from that perspective  
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6074) and yeah it just becomes very difficult  
[1:41:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6077) you know to justify  
[1:41:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6079) punishing people and  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6082) moral accountability so i would agree  
[1:41:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6084) with you there  
[1:41:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6085) you do  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6086) yeah go ahead  
[1:41:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6087) i was just going to say to get a good  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6089) insight into  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6091) what an atheist would say about this um  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6094) yeah check out um sam harris so he wrote  
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6097) a book on free will basically he holds  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6100) the prince of positions you were  
[1:41:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6101) mentioning  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6102) and he takes it to his logical  
[1:41:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6103) conclusion where he he denies free will  
[1:41:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6105) he denies  
[1:41:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6107) um the self exists so there's no  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6109) individual individuality this is um the  
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6112) self is an illusion  
[1:41:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6113) um and yeah so like he just sort of runs  
[1:41:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6117) it to the end and that obviously if you  
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6119) want to see what  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6121) they think from the horse's mouth  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6123) there's that book in particular that's  
[1:42:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6124) going to really give you an insight into  
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6127) the yeah i kind of know his opinion i  
[1:42:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6129) don't really  
[1:42:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6130) like care for it i'm cur like  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6133) i like graham opie quite a bit i'm  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6135) curious do you guys know what he would  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6136) think or somebody along those lines  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6138) because i don't know if sam harris is  
[1:42:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6139) necessarily a philosopher really no yeah  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6142) yeah  
[1:42:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6143) but at least he's um  
[1:42:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6145) he's kind of a figure  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6156) but i think  
[1:42:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6158) he would be some type of compatibilist  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6160) from from what i understand okay so so  
[1:42:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6163) being an atheist doesn't necessarily  
[1:42:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6165) mean that um you think the whole  
[1:42:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6167) universe and even human beings operate  
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6170) mechanically then i guess  
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6172) well i think that  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6175) even if you  
[1:42:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6176) i think he thinks at the quantum level  
[1:42:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6179) there's some type of indeterminacy but  
[1:43:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6181) even that would be outside of your  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6182) control but i think what he would say or  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6185) try to argue is as long as  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6189) you performing in action is due to  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6192) yourself that you  
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6194) you uh  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6195) out of your desire or wants that you  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6198) actually did it and that you weren't  
[1:43:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6199) compelled to do it by somebody else like  
[1:43:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6202) with a gun to your head then he would  
[1:43:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6204) consider you free enough to be  
[1:43:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6206) morally accountable now whether you  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6208) agree with that or not is another story  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6210) but i think that's what you would say  
[1:43:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6212) okay  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6213) yeah um okay so i think you guys answer  
[1:43:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6215) my question uh before i go i do want to  
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6217) ask you one more um it's not related to  
[1:43:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6219) the subject sure um fraud is the hobby  
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6222) who i really like to listen to him uh he  
[1:43:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6225) offers a few uh  
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6228) not cosmological arguments but other  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6230) arguments yeah and one of the arguments  
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6232) that he mentioned was um  
[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6235) he didn't really go into depth so i'm  
[1:43:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6236) wondering if you guys know this argument  
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6238) and if you could go if you could mention  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6239) it or talk about it a little bit that'd  
[1:44:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6241) be nice to hear  
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6242) but um he's he mentions how  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6244) the extreme skeptic  
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6246) argument  
[1:44:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6247) where basically i don't believe anything  
[1:44:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6249) i see it could all be an illusion  
[1:44:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6252) um you know it could be uh  
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6253) you know  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6255) i don't trust anything i see or hear the  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6257) only thing i know is that i exist the  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6260) subject  
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6261) and for a subject i need i need to uh  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6264) depend on an objective existence and  
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6266) then he makes the argument that that's  
[1:44:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6268) gone but i'm curious do you guys know  
[1:44:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6270) are you familiar with that argument and  
[1:44:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6272) can you go into a little bit more detail  
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6273) because it was kind of vague when he  
[1:44:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6274) mentioned it i think it's a i think it's  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6276) a form of transcendental argument i've  
[1:44:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6279) not heard that particular argument from  
[1:44:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6281) zahabi so i'm not sure exactly but from  
[1:44:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6283) what you described so he's saying that i  
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6286) exist i believe that there's an  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6288) objective reality and i have to ground  
[1:44:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6291) the objective reality in something and  
[1:44:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6293) that objective reality is god is that  
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6295) his argument yeah that's what that's  
[1:44:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6297) what it sounds like to me yeah so it's a  
[1:44:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6299) form of transcendental argumentation so  
[1:45:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6302) for god  
[1:45:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6303) uh so there's various arguments that  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6306) you know  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6306) can we as human beings objectively  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6309) establish truth  
[1:45:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6311) if all we are are uh products of  
[1:45:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6313) material agents you know or materialism  
[1:45:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6316) so if our mind is just a product of the  
[1:45:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6319) brain and the brain is in you know just  
[1:45:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6322) uh matter in motion unconscious agents  
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6325) how can we ground truth how can we  
[1:45:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6327) ground something which is objectively  
[1:45:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6329) true  
[1:45:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6330) and so  
[1:45:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6331) uh some some philosophers are like uh  
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6334) externalist in their view  
[1:45:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6337) of knowledge they believe that actually  
[1:45:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6339) knowledge is not something that we come  
[1:45:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6341) up with but rather knowledge is  
[1:45:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6343) something that exists as a as an  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6345) objective fact which has to be given to  
[1:45:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6347) us and so therefore he says if we  
[1:45:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6350) believe that there is objective  
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6351) knowledge  
[1:45:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6352) then this would lead to a conclusion  
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6355) that there is a god that grounds that  
[1:45:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6357) objective knowledge otherwise we  
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6359) couldn't ground that objective knowledge  
[1:46:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6362) i think we will probably have a show on  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6364) this subject on the various  
[1:46:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6365) transcendental arguments for god's  
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6367) existence because there's a fear okay  
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6370) yeah i'd love to hear it one day  
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6372) yeah yeah we'll be getting into that  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6374) probably soon but uh sean we appreciate  
[1:46:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6376) you coming on and your uh continued  
[1:46:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6379) support may allah bless you okay thanks

[1:46:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6391) siri thinks i'm talking to her  
[1:46:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6394) yeah  
[1:46:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6395) i can also say shalom i think this will  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6398) be okay  
[1:46:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6400) so  
[1:46:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6400) thank you for having me are you jewish  
[1:46:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6402) peter  
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6404) um  
[1:46:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6405) yes  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6406) and but i'm an atheist right and you'll  
[1:46:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6408) see that oh there's a contradiction but  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6410) we are not talking about that right  
[1:46:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6412) no um your topic was like the free will  
[1:46:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6416) and uh well no the the topic is actually  
[1:47:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6420) what's logic got to do with it how to  
[1:47:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6422) spot logical contradictions  
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6424) um but of course if you've got a  
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6426) specific thing that you think is a  
[1:47:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6429) contradiction we'll take a look at it um  
[1:47:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6432) so we were the stream was mainly just  
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6433) about explaining what logic is and what  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6436) contributions okay okay i'm not and i  
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6438) have to admit i'm not the greatest  
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6440) philosopher on this earth  
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6443) so you have of course better knowledge  
[1:47:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6444) than i have but i will ask you um  
[1:47:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6448) what will be  
[1:47:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6449) the reason to make a choice  
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6452) at  
[1:47:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6453) in any ways so what will be from your  
[1:47:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6455) perspective  
[1:47:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6457) a reason to make a choice at all  
[1:47:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6459) it doesn't matter for what it is  
[1:47:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6462) um  
[1:47:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6464) and and and according to my to your  
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6466) answer  
[1:47:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6468) i will ask you the next question  
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6470) and then you will come to the  
[1:47:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6471) contradictions um okay um i don't know  
[1:47:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6474) if anybody understood the question  
[1:47:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6476) because i i really didn't get it i mean  
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6478) if i could if i could just understand it  
[1:47:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6479) like uh if i could just answer it like  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6481) the way i understood it  
[1:48:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6483) using to to do something  
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6484) can be as simple as like i'm thirsty so  
[1:48:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6486) i drink  
[1:48:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6487) so that's so thirsty so i choose to  
[1:48:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6489) drink  
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6490) uh so it's like the necessity  
[1:48:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6493) so i'm thirsty but i can choose not to  
[1:48:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6494) drink but i'm thirsty  
[1:48:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6497) i can also choose to drink so so it's a  
[1:48:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6499) month of ramadan we are very thirsty  
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6502) um but we take it upon ourselves not to  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6504) drink  
[1:48:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6506) so it's like a condition you have and  
[1:48:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6507) based upon this condition  
[1:48:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6510) you will choose or not choose to do  
[1:48:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6512) something right  
[1:48:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6514) possibly i mean you could have a yeah so  
[1:48:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6515) you could have a reason that's  
[1:48:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6516) non-necessitating in the sense that the  
[1:48:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6518) reason doesn't entail  
[1:48:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6520) uh you know uh whatever it is that  
[1:48:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6522) follows  
[1:48:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6524) and and if you will uh do something uh  
[1:48:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6527) which will um  
[1:48:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6529) because you talk like thirst  
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6531) being thirsty this is like a  
[1:48:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6534) condition  
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6536) that your body is telling you  
[1:48:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6538) uh yeah you are thirsty please take some  
[1:49:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6541) water to you right yeah um  
[1:49:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6545) but it's not the usual stuff  
[1:49:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6548) or not not that's not the only stuff  
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6550) what i'm trying to say isn't  
[1:49:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6553) and you can say you agree or not that to  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6556) make a choice  
[1:49:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6557) and then you are  
[1:49:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6559) need something or you don't need  
[1:49:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6561) something and then you  
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6563) then you choose to do something or you  
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6565) choose not to do something would you  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6567) agree with that and i'm trying to be as  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6569) broad as i can  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6571) i'm i mean i'm not sure what you're  
[1:49:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6572) saying to be honest i so i  
[1:49:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6574) i mean there are  
[1:49:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6576) we have reasons to do things and we can  
[1:49:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6578) choose what to do based on those reasons  
[1:49:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6581) i guess but if you have reasons it will  
[1:49:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6584) mean that you are thinking of them and  
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6587) uh kind of um  
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6591) basically can i help you out can i help  
[1:49:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6593) you out  
[1:49:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6594) are you trying to say that  
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6596) the reasons for you to make choices is  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6598) because of external conditions that you  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6600) do not control  
[1:50:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6604) i'm i'm  
[1:50:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6606) what i'm trying to get at if somebody  
[1:50:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6608) makes choices  
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6609) there must be a reason for it and if  
[1:50:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6612) there is a reason  
[1:50:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6614) um he is just thinking of that he is not  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6619) neutral about that  
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6621) he just needs to  
[1:50:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6624) um  
[1:50:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6624) i will come to that um so if i so if i  
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6627) have two snicker bars right in front of  
[1:50:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6629) me and they're equidistant from me  
[1:50:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6631) they're like in the same equal distance  
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6633) from me and i choose one  
[1:50:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6636) um  
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6637) i would you say the same thing that  
[1:50:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6639) there are reasons i have for choosing  
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6641) one over the other because not for my no  
[1:50:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6644) no no  
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6645) the reason the reason will be that i  
[1:50:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6646) want to eat  
[1:50:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6652) the reason i chose one over the other  
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6654) i'm telling you i have two identical  
[1:50:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6655) ones and they're they're they're just at  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6658) the same distance from me  
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6659) i i could choose one or the other right  
[1:51:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6663) yeah but i'm not asking that the reason  
[1:51:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6666) that you chose  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6668) it  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6668) in the first place to choose one is that  
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6672) you want to eat okay so yeah so are you  
[1:51:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6675) trying to make like an argument like are  
[1:51:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6677) you trying to argue in favor of  
[1:51:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6678) determinism that our  
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6680) everything  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6682) on prior reasons and things that you  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6684) know okay it might be helpful if you  
[1:51:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6687) just lay out the argument yeah yes like  
[1:51:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6689) i i should do it now right  
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6692) so  
[1:51:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6693) um  
[1:51:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6695) you  
[1:51:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6696) are saying that there is a god who is  
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6698) not  
[1:51:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6700) depending on anything  
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6702) and then he chooses  
[1:51:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6705) he does not need  
[1:51:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6706) universes he creates universes he does  
[1:51:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6708) not need sons but he creates sense he  
[1:51:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6711) does not need people but he creates  
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6713) people  
[1:51:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6715) and for me  
[1:51:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6716) that's a contradiction  
[1:51:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6719) because if a god and if i look up all  
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6722) your definitions for a god  
[1:52:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6724) he does not need anything he will should  
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6727) be in a sense  
[1:52:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6728) so so based on what you just said i can  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6730) just ch i can just you know uh  
[1:52:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6731) substitute those sentences with with  
[1:52:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6734) with uh the snickers example i don't  
[1:52:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6736) need the snickers but i ate a snickers  
[1:52:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6738) um yeah how is that a contradiction why  
[1:52:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6741) does there need to be a need  
[1:52:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6744) in order a contradiction yeah a  
[1:52:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6745) contradiction just just just to just to  
[1:52:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6747) get you on track is a and not a so  
[1:52:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6750) i i need the snickers and i don't need  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6753) it if both of those if both of those are  
[1:52:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6755) true no no it cannot be equal if you say  
[1:52:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6757) a is not a  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6759) cannot equal not a  
[1:52:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6761) means that you will not choose  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6764) to take any one of them  
[1:52:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6766) because you don't standard  
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6768) so jake read this out a while ago the  
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6770) standard definition of of a  
[1:52:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6774) contradiction is basically the conduct  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6776) of a and not a both of those being true  
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6778) at the same time in the same way so what  
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6780) i'm saying is me  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6782) not me not needing a snickers yet  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6785) choosing to eat it that there's no a and  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6787) not a there  
[1:53:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6788) oh my you might have questions about why  
[1:53:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6790) i ate it it's just  
[1:53:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6792) well he's i think he's assuming that  
[1:53:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6794) action  
[1:53:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6795) necessarily entails um a need  
[1:53:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6799) and i think that's a dependency yeah i  
[1:53:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6802) think that's i think that's false  
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6804) um no because uh okay you think i i yeah  
[1:53:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6808) you have to give an argument for it  
[1:53:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6810) because we can get  
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6811) counter examples to that yeah where we  
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6814) act  
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6814) we do plenty of actions without a need  
[1:53:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6817) i don't need to be on the stream right  
[1:53:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6819) now right but  
[1:53:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6821) you could choose not to live at all but  
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6824) of course you are human we are talking  
[1:53:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6826) about a being  
[1:53:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6827) which is doesn't need anything there is  
[1:53:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6830) no reason for him to do anything but he  
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6833) still creates  
[1:53:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6834) what there's no reason for it  
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6837) no so  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6838) you said he doesn't need anything  
[1:53:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6839) yeah and then you said there's no reason  
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6842) for him to do anything  
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6843) that's not true  
[1:54:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6846) because if he does no reason yeah  
[1:54:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6848) because if he does not need anything he  
[1:54:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6850) will do not he'll be in a zen state he  
[1:54:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6852) will be all  
[1:54:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6853) satisfied with himself he will be you  
[1:54:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6855) know so  
[1:54:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6856) satisfaction yes so i don't need the  
[1:54:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6858) snickers bars but i can have a reason to  
[1:54:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6860) eat it like i like snickers bars so the  
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6862) problem here pio is that you're you're  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6864) coming from a place i get that you're  
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6866) trying to like speak your mind and  
[1:54:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6867) explain your position to us but then you  
[1:54:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6869) need to be more clear with the terms you  
[1:54:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6871) use and actually point out a  
[1:54:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6874) contradiction you're not doing that  
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6875) because  
[1:54:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6876) everything you're saying i can give you  
[1:54:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6877) a counter example and explain to you  
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6879) that okay okay i need a snickers bar but  
[1:54:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6882) yet have reasons to eat it so okay p1  
[1:54:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6885) a god does not need anything  
[1:54:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6888) two is  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6891) if  
[1:54:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6892) he  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6893) do something he needs something that's  
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6895) false that's what we're saying  
[1:54:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6897) yeah  
[1:54:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6898) as i said  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6899) you're my premise  
[1:55:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6903) you're assuming  
[1:55:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6904) that an action  
[1:55:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6907) necessitates a need and we're giving  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6909) counter examples to show that that's  
[1:55:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6911) false a reason doesn't mean that it's  
[1:55:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6914) necessary that's the second point that's  
[1:55:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6916) another presupposition that you have  
[1:55:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6918) that we also reject so you need to give  
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6920) an argument for the premise other than  
[1:55:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6923) just stating it because we're giving  
[1:55:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6924) counter examples to it yeah no so you  
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6927) need to do that basically  
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6928) i want to choose this one or there is no  
[1:55:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6931) reason because i just want to meet  
[1:55:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6933) people but you're wanting but you're  
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6935) wanting you're doing at all  
[1:55:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6938) not wanting no i'm not i i don't need in  
[1:55:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6941) order for me to perform an action  
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6943) doesn't need that i mean that i have a  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6945) need  
[1:55:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6947) but what why then you will do anything  
[1:55:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6950) if you don't have a need to have a  
[1:55:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6952) reason as you stated yeah but a reason  
[1:55:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6954) is not a need that's the point a reason  
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6957) is an explanation partial explanation or  
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6959) it could be a full explanation but it's  
[1:56:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6960) not a need necessarily yeah but there is  
[1:56:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6963) a reason it's meaning  
[1:56:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6967) just very broad there is a reason it  
[1:56:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6970) meaning it means that you want to change  
[1:56:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6973) your state whatever it means can there  
[1:56:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6974) be a reason without a need  
[1:56:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6977) no  
[1:56:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6978) well that's the thing you're saying  
[1:56:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6980) there cannot be a reason without a need  
[1:56:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6982) you need to provide an argument for that  
[1:56:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6986) because for everything  
[1:56:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6989) for at least  
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6990) we do  
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6991) there is a reason right  
[1:56:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6994) and no  
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6995) yeah but but even if i have a reason it  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6997) doesn't require a need  
[1:56:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=6999) i have a reason for being on the stream  
[1:56:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7001) that doesn't mean i need to be here like  
[1:56:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7003) if you keep repeating to me over and  
[1:56:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7005) over again that i have to have a need  
[1:56:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7008) i'll probably just boot you from the  
[1:56:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7009) stream just to prove the point  
[1:56:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7012) yeah yeah so and then where you can say  
[1:56:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7014) i needed to do that no i can choose to  
[1:56:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7016) stay here and talk to peo about needs or  
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7019) not having needs or i could just say you  
[1:57:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7021) know what hell with it and leave the  
[1:57:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7022) stream  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7023) so  
[1:57:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7025) abdul rahman gave an example earlier he  
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7027) said if you got two chocolate bars which  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7029) are equidistant to each other and you  
[1:57:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7031) pick one over the other one yeah  
[1:57:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7034) the the decision here the decision here  
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7038) is between two equidistant chocolate  
[1:57:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7040) bars  
[1:57:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7042) so he's saying that you don't need you  
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7044) don't have to have a need to pick one  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7047) over the other  
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7049) yeah so he's this is a clear example of  
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7052) a choice that's not predicated upon a  
[1:57:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7055) need  
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7057) okay we are now you're right  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7061) in the example what we are talking about  
[1:57:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7064) but i'm talking of course  
[1:57:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7066) about the god who now already knows  
[1:57:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7069) what will happen  
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7071) whatever  
[1:57:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7073) choice he made  
[1:57:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7075) i'm saying what will be the reason for  
[1:57:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7077) him  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7078) to create anything he knows the outcome  
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7081) yeah  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7084) so this is this is this is  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7086) the step second issue this is a very  
[1:58:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7087) good demonstration of why we're having  
[1:58:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7089) the stream right so you you initially  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7091) came on saying you're trying to  
[1:58:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7092) demonstrate a contradiction but it  
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7094) shouldn't be very difficult to at least  
[1:58:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7096) present a valid form which i think you  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7098) did kind of when you mentioned that you  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7100) know in order god doesn't need god  
[1:58:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7102) doesn't need anything and you know in  
[1:58:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7104) order to act you must need something so  
[1:58:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7107) here the thing is you might you might be  
[1:58:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7108) able to present a valid argument the  
[1:58:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7112) problem is we're going to reject that  
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7114) premise that every act requires a need  
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7117) you're saying that okay fine maybe in  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7119) the case of humans you don't need needs  
[1:58:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7120) but in the case of god there's maybe  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7122) some difference distinction you're  
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7124) pointing to but you need to substantiate  
[1:58:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7126) that you need to explain why god's act  
[1:58:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7129) necessitates that he needs it if it's  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7131) just an intuition you have you know in  
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7133) your mind that's okay but you're not  
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7135) going to convince us by that in the  
[1:58:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7138) sense that we don't understand where  
[1:58:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7139) you're coming from so you're going to  
[1:59:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7140) have to substantiate the claim that god  
[1:59:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7144) acting  
[1:59:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7145) necessitates that he has a need  
[1:59:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7149) in fact i'm saying the opposite but i'm  
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7152) trying to explain it yeah so if i  
[1:59:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7154) understand what you said here  
[1:59:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7157) um so i would say every human  
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7160) when he does  
[1:59:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7161) anything  
[1:59:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7163) he has a need he's doing  
[1:59:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7165) because of reasons  
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7168) and because he doesn't know the future  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7171) and the different stuff for a god and  
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7174) i'm not  
[1:59:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7175) trying to disprove your god i'm just  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7177) asking  
[1:59:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7178) about the concept right about the  
[1:59:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7180) concept i'm not here to like disprove  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7182) your religion or something and we are  
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7184) just talking right i'm not debating  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7187) yeah so i don't understand so i  
[1:59:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7189) understand when you say for a human he  
[1:59:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7191) will choose that or he will do some this  
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7194) in this action yeah because there's a  
[1:59:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7196) reason and the more the biggest reason  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7198) of it  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7198) and from my perspective is he does not  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7201) know the future  
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7203) in the case of a god he already knows  
[2:00:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7205) what will happen  
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7206) and he does not need anything and he  
[2:00:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7210) still creates what is their reason for a  
[2:00:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7213) god to create  
[2:00:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7215) yeah so appeal there's a few things that  
[2:00:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7218) we need to identify  
[2:00:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7219) first thing that we need to identify is  
[2:00:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7221) that is this an argument that results in  
[2:00:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7224) a logical contradiction  
[2:00:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7227) yeah for me it's a logical contradiction  
[2:00:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7229) when somebody says that god created  
[2:00:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7232) something because for me as and i'm an  
[2:00:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7236) atheist right i just going with the  
[2:00:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7238) explanation of other people  
[2:00:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7241) so for me so you can teach me on that  
[2:00:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7243) yeah no no  
[2:00:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7244) there is no  
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7246) doubt about it  
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7247) right but i don't understand if there is  
[2:00:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7249) an all-knowing all-powerful  
[2:00:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7252) god that he will do anything  
[2:00:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7257) because he already knows what will  
[2:00:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7259) happen  
[2:01:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7260) and uh yeah for me a god will be in a  
[2:01:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7263) sense day  
[2:01:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7264) like  
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7265) he'll be lucky with yeah ccpo this is  
[2:01:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7269) the this is part of the the issue is  
[2:01:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7271) that  
[2:01:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7272) what sense happens when people say  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7273) there's a contradiction  
[2:01:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7275) what they're doing is they've got a lot  
[2:01:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7277) of loaded  
[2:01:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7278) philosophical assumptions or you know  
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7281) assumptions that they're bringing to the  
[2:01:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7283) table  
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7284) so for example initially you brought to  
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7286) the table that when a person did does an  
[2:01:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7289) act it's because he needs something  
[2:01:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7291) because he's incomplete then we  
[2:01:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7292) explained that and then you start saying  
[2:01:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7294) well the reason why a person doesn't act  
[2:01:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7296) is because he doesn't know what's gonna  
[2:01:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7298) happen in the future so he doesn't act  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7300) yeah  
[2:01:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7301) and i'm sure we can give many examples  
[2:01:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7303) where people act even when they do not  
[2:01:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7305) spoken in this case about persons i  
[2:01:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7307) talked with god i  
[2:01:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7314) this is the point the point is you're  
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7315) analogizing between what human beings to  
[2:01:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7317) do and then you're analogizing that to  
[2:01:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7319) god so all i'm saying is that what  
[2:02:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7321) you're doing is you're taking a lot of  
[2:02:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7322) your own presuppositions  
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7325) and attempting to apply it to god  
[2:02:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7328) and therefore saying  
[2:02:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7329) if god exists  
[2:02:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7331) then he would not have done x or he  
[2:02:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7334) would have done x based upon  
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7337) my assumptions about what i would do uh  
[2:02:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7341) regards to this  
[2:02:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7342) so  
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7343) that's that's the problem the problem is  
[2:02:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7345) that you have to question your own  
[2:02:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7347) presuppositions because we will question  
[2:02:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7349) it and we will engage in that discussion  
[2:02:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7352) of saying actually this is the case you  
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7353) know why do you think this is the case  
[2:02:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7356) and if you can't justify that then you  
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7359) can't say that it reduces to a  
[2:02:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7361) contradiction yeah and i don't think you  
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7363) can justify any of the presuppositions  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7365) that you presented so far but you need  
[2:02:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7367) to recognize your presuppositions that's  
[2:02:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7369) the issue  
[2:02:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7371) sharif i agree with you  
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7374) i'm i'm  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7376) doing my prepositions and i also already  
[2:02:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7379) explained that everything what i do is  
[2:03:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7382) based on some reasons  
[2:03:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7385) and i didn't compare  
[2:03:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7388) god to me or humans i made the  
[2:03:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7391) distinction between an all-knowing god  
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7395) and a human and that's why i said the  
[2:03:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7397) humans are doing stuff because they  
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7398) don't know what will happen  
[2:03:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7400) and uh they don't always know the right  
[2:03:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7403) thing  
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7404) yeah but  
[2:03:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7406) let me stop you right there about the  
[2:03:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7407) knowing the future thing well again i  
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7408) just so  
[2:03:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7410) this is not a logical uh you know  
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7414) argument if if that's what you're trying  
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7415) to do i mean if you're just speaking  
[2:03:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7416) your mind it's fine but if you're trying  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7418) to say that knowing the future means  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7420) that you can't do things because you  
[2:03:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7421) know what's going to happen  
[2:03:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7423) i mean where's the  
[2:03:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7424) how do you make that link i can know  
[2:03:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7427) i can know the future and still do  
[2:03:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7428) things  
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7429) yeah but it will be no this is for me a  
[2:03:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7432) contradiction if i already know how  
[2:03:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7437) i mean  
[2:03:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7438) i i just the problem is  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7440) you have this intuition about the way  
[2:04:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7441) things work that you know no i'm just  
[2:04:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7443) sitting here talking your opinion so  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7445) let's be clear about that i understand i  
[2:04:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7446) understand i'm not trying to argue with  
[2:04:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7447) you and i appreciate talking to you i'm  
[2:04:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7449) what i'm saying is i'm giving you my  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7450) perspective i'm saying i hear you just  
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7453) sharing your intuition about the way  
[2:04:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7455) things should work in the case of an  
[2:04:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7458) all-knowing being but i don't see any  
[2:04:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7461) you know logical deconstruction of that  
[2:04:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7464) intuition i i just see you saying that  
[2:04:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7466) it feels like if he knew everything  
[2:04:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7468) that's going to happen he will not do  
[2:04:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7470) something but how do you make that jump  
[2:04:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7472) how do you make that inference between  
[2:04:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7474) knowing the future and not being able to  
[2:04:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7477) do things or not not doing things i just  
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7480) don't see a logical entailment there you  
[2:04:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7483) just think that that's what would happen  
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7486) if he knew the future  
[2:04:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7487) so in order for you to convince me with  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7490) that i think you're gonna have to do  
[2:04:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7491) more work and substantiate it that's  
[2:04:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7492) okay yeah  
[2:04:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7494) so for example really quickly for  
[2:04:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7496) example i could give an example a  
[2:04:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7498) counselor example i could say well i  
[2:05:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7500) know that if i offer this chocolate to  
[2:05:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7503) this you know child or son whoever is  
[2:05:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7506) he'll take it  
[2:05:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7507) now  
[2:05:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7508) my knowledge of what's going to happen  
[2:05:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7510) in the future is not going to say well  
[2:05:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7512) therefore i'm not going to offer  
[2:05:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7514) chocolate to this kid yeah  
[2:05:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7516) so i'm still going to you know i can  
[2:05:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7518) still offer the chocolate to the kid  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7520) even though i know what the consequence  
[2:05:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7522) is going to be in terms of the action  
[2:05:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7525) yeah so it doesn't it doesn't this is  
[2:05:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7527) the problem is that your positions  
[2:05:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7529) doesn't entail  
[2:05:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7531) a logical contradiction and it doesn't  
[2:05:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7534) entail something that's a metaphysical  
[2:05:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7536) impossibility yeah these two different  
[2:05:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7538) things  
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7539) uh rather what it is is that you've got  
[2:05:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7542) these sort of  
[2:05:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7543) feelings of how things how people think  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7546) and why people act and then you're  
[2:05:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7549) attempting to  
[2:05:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7550) claim well let me superimpose this upon  
[2:05:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7552) god and therefore results in a  
[2:05:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7554) contradiction it doesn't result in a  
[2:05:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7556) contradiction it only results in a  
[2:05:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7557) contradiction based upon  
[2:06:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7560) the presuppositions which i think are  
[2:06:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7563) unfounded that you have  
[2:06:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7565) uh uh that you hold on to yeah so you're  
[2:06:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7568) superimposing your view and then saying  
[2:06:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7570) because it doesn't uh accord to my view  
[2:06:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7573) it's therefore a contradiction  
[2:06:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7576) when i will go and i'll be you can after  
[2:06:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7579) that you can  
[2:06:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7580) leave me out because there are other  
[2:06:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7582) people if i will go only with just your  
[2:06:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7584) example offering the kid the chocolate  
[2:06:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7586) right yeah but if i were new this truck  
[2:06:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7589) would poison him  
[2:06:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7591) would you do it still do it  
[2:06:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7594) it depends on  
[2:06:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7595) you  
[2:06:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7597) what do you mean  
[2:06:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7600) is it little hitler no no it says  
[2:06:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7602) nothing no no let's go now to extreme  
[2:06:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7604) let's go stick by the example no no no  
[2:06:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7606) but that is that's he that's why he's  
[2:06:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7608) saying it depends  
[2:06:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7609) there are extremes  
[2:06:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7611) no your knowledge your knowledge exactly  
[2:06:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7613) your knowledge is you'll give the child  
[2:06:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7616) the chocolate and the child will take it  
[2:06:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7619) but this chocolate will poison him yeah  
[2:07:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7621) would you still do it  
[2:07:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7623) well  
[2:07:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7624) like i said  
[2:07:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7625) me personally obviously it's haram for  
[2:07:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7627) me to do that i wouldn't do that because  
[2:07:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7628) it's not allowed islamically but in this  
[2:07:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7631) fictional scenario the issue isn't about  
[2:07:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7634) whether you would give somebody a bar  
[2:07:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7636) chocolates poison the issue is  
[2:07:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7639) i know the consequence of the future  
[2:07:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7642) just by knowing the consequence of the  
[2:07:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7644) future does it stop me from doing the  
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7646) action no it doesn't stop me from doing  
[2:07:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7647) the action so you will poison the kid so  
[2:07:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7650) no no the point he told you  
[2:07:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7653) yeah it's not analogous  
[2:07:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7656) your argument was this initially your  
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7658) argument was about how actions are  
[2:07:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7661) basically changed like three times  
[2:07:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7663) already and then it became about and  
[2:07:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7664) then it became about well if god knows  
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7667) things in the future why would he act  
[2:07:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7669) because humans only act based on not  
[2:07:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7671) knowing what's the consequence i gave an  
[2:07:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7673) er every bottle to that and now you're  
[2:07:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7676) saying well no no  
[2:07:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7677) you just said you know it was like  
[2:07:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7679) giving a poisonous chocolate to a child  
[2:08:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7682) would you do it knowing the consequence  
[2:08:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7684) but again  
[2:08:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7686) you know  
[2:08:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7687) just that's not analogous to the initial  
[2:08:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7689) point that's my that's my issue  
[2:08:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7693) okay you just said that yeah and  
[2:08:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7695) yeah thank you thank you very much for  
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7696) your talks thank you for having me and i  
[2:08:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7698) will go now thank you take care  
[2:08:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7703) all right so we've got uh mr danish next  
[2:08:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7706) right  
[2:08:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7708) i mean i mean can we just look at this  
[2:08:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7710) real real quick real quick  
[2:08:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7712) our friend our friend here matthew  
[2:08:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7714) bartus who's come on the show a few  
[2:08:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7715) times here are two contradictions the  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7717) quran and many early muslims believe  
[2:08:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7719) that humans had no free will now they  
[2:08:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7721) say they do have free will here's  
[2:08:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7723) another one allah tests people but allah  
[2:08:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7725) knows the future  
[2:08:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7726) i mean really this is why we're doing  
[2:08:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7728) the stream come on  
[2:08:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7729) and this guy matthew bardos is a lawyer  
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7732) he's imagine this guy is the one that's  
[2:08:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7735) supposed to be defending you in court  
[2:08:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7737) and making arguments or maybe he's you  
[2:09:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7740) know what if he's the plaintiff i would  
[2:09:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7742) say please can you bring matthew to  
[2:09:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7744) represent the state i'd like to get off  
[2:09:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7746) easy  
[2:09:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7747) i'm sorry matt but i think that you  
[2:09:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7750) should have  
[2:09:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7751) taken a bit more attention to  
[2:09:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7754) some basic critical thinking courses in  
[2:09:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7756) your university career no no but we like  
[2:09:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7759) matthew anyway but he's about i'm not  
[2:09:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7761) saying i don't like him i mean i'm just  
[2:09:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7762) saying it's a bad argument and  
[2:09:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7765) he has mentioned that he's a lawyer and  
[2:09:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7767) i find it interesting because lawyers  
[2:09:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7769) are the ones that are supposed to be  
[2:09:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7771) constructing or defending against  
[2:09:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7773) arguments  
[2:09:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7774) and  
[2:09:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7775) these are the kind of people that we  
[2:09:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7776) have in that position so  
[2:09:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7779) um  
[2:09:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7780) anyway i wouldn't hire you matt that's  
[2:09:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7782) all i'm saying  
[2:09:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7783) [Laughter]  
[2:09:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7790) um this is uh i'm sorry to interrupt you  
[2:09:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7793) guys can i can you guys call on me like  
[2:09:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7795) next because i have to help uh one of my  
[2:09:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7797) parents do something  
[2:09:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7799) yeah sure we'll bring you back  
[2:10:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7801) yeah okay sure it'll take like few  
[2:10:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7802) minutes thank you thank you no problem  
[2:10:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7804) i think we got abu mohammed next  
[2:10:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7808) that's it danish is not coming back on  
[2:10:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7810) now  
[2:10:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7810) [Laughter]  
[2:10:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7827) yeah it's good to hear in your voice  
[2:10:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7829) yeah likewise  
[2:10:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7831) have you got a comment  
[2:10:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7833) yeah i got a question  
[2:10:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7834) yeah i know i do mention a little bit  
[2:10:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7837) but i just need a little bit example  
[2:10:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7840) what is the can you give an example of  
[2:10:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7843) something that is logically  
[2:10:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7846) possible physically possible and  
[2:10:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7847) metaphysically possible  
[2:10:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7850) and is there anything such as  
[2:10:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7852) ontological possibility  
[2:10:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7858) yeah  
[2:10:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7859) so so something that's logically  
[2:11:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7861) possible and metaphysically possible  
[2:11:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7863) um  
[2:11:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7864) so i mean logically possible and  
[2:11:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7866) metaphysically actual  
[2:11:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7868) is easy which is also like possible in  
[2:11:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7870) the sense that it exists in a possible  
[2:11:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7872) world which is the actual world  
[2:11:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7874) the existence of this world the universe  
[2:11:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7876) i mean that's metaphysically possible  
[2:11:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7878) and logically possible  
[2:11:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7880) uh as but i mean other stuff like so  
[2:11:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7883) metaphysical modality is a bit tricky  
[2:11:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7885) because it's just going to depend on  
[2:11:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7887) what your view what your what your  
[2:11:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7890) theory of modality is that's going to  
[2:11:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7892) determine what you think is actually  
[2:11:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7894) metaphysically possible so that's a very  
[2:11:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7895) deep discussion  
[2:11:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7897) uh but what was the second question  
[2:11:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7899) ontological is there anything as  
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7901) ontologically possibility  
[2:11:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7904) yeah so there's uh  
[2:11:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7906) yeah so there's there's something like  
[2:11:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7908) called ontological necessity for example  
[2:11:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7910) that uh it's basically it's basically  
[2:11:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7913) the fact that  
[2:11:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7915) more like of if you if you have like a  
[2:11:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7917) causal chain  
[2:11:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7919) and then you like you have a first uh  
[2:12:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7921) you know member in that causal chain you  
[2:12:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7924) say like it's ontologically necessary  
[2:12:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7927) you know for the chain to be so that  
[2:12:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7929) that's an ontological necessity  
[2:12:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7934) interesting interesting  
[2:12:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7935) uh so let's say someone said  
[2:12:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7938) something can come from  
[2:12:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7941) nothing with that for under a logical  
[2:12:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7944) possibility in logical possibilities  
[2:12:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7947) possible  
[2:12:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7948) that's a good question so if you can't  
[2:12:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7950) derive a contradiction from it you  
[2:12:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7951) wouldn't be able to say it's a logical  
[2:12:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7953) melody  
[2:12:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7954) it's a metaphor yeah so you could say  
[2:12:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7956) it's a metaphysical impossibility so  
[2:12:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7957) something can be  
[2:12:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7959) a logical possibility but a metaphysical  
[2:12:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7963) impossibility  
[2:12:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7965) yeah  
[2:12:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7966) very good answer man  
[2:12:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7968) uh last one  
[2:12:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7971) is contradiction same as impossibility  
[2:12:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7974) and how can one prove something to be  
[2:12:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7976) impossible  
[2:12:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7978) so you i mean a metaphor again so a  
[2:13:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7980) metaphysical impossibility doesn't have  
[2:13:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7982) to be a contradiction we just discussed  
[2:13:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7983) one right so something coming from  
[2:13:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7985) nothing uh a logical impossibility yes i  
[2:13:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7988) think it has to be a contradiction  
[2:13:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7991) and uh what was what was the last thing  
[2:13:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7993) you said  
[2:13:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7996) do you prove something to be impossible  
[2:13:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=7998) uh contradiction i mean there's proof by  
[2:13:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8000) contradiction is a big thing in logic  
[2:13:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8003) so proof by contradiction is is huge  
[2:13:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8006) uh you can prove something also like  
[2:13:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8008) it's like a conditional impossibility  
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8010) which is similar to a metaphysical  
[2:13:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8011) possibility based on certain assumptions  
[2:13:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8014) or or or within a certain paradigm you  
[2:13:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8016) can prove that something is  
[2:13:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8017) metaphysically impossible  
[2:13:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8020) um  
[2:13:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8020) normal logical  
[2:13:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8022) modality as well which deals with like  
[2:13:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8024) the laws of nature and stuff so within a  
[2:13:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8026) scientific paradigm you know the  
[2:13:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8028) scientists can say that you know such  
[2:13:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8030) and such happening is impossible and  
[2:13:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8032) they'd be speaking more in like a normal  
[2:13:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8034) logical sense  
[2:13:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8036) good answer man yeah  
[2:13:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8039) thank you very much  
[2:14:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8040) everybody supported  
[2:14:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8042) me  
[2:14:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8046) yeah you did i made an easy plan today  
[2:14:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8050) thanks bro thanks a lot good to hear  
[2:14:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8051) your voice  
[2:14:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8057) all right let's go back to  
[2:14:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8060) danish  
[2:14:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8064) salaam are you ready brother or you need  
[2:14:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8066) a couple more minutes  
[2:14:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8069) i'm good  
[2:14:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8070) okay go ahead  
[2:14:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8071) yeah yeah we can hear you okay  
[2:14:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8074) so um my question you guys probably have  
[2:14:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8077) uh maybe covered this but um i came in  
[2:14:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8080) late and i wanted it to be answered  
[2:14:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8083) so  
[2:14:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8084) um i was like  
[2:14:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8085) researching and basically um one of like  
[2:14:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8088) the arguments we have against a  
[2:14:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8090) christianity is that like  
[2:14:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8092) jesus uh alaihissalam  
[2:14:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8094) couldn't have been a man because this  
[2:14:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8095) went against the intrinsic attributes of  
[2:14:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8098) allah right so allah is one but um but  
[2:15:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8101) christianity proposes three gods um as  
[2:15:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8104) well as one jesus was begotten but allah  
[2:15:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8107) is eternal god is eternal so different  
[2:15:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8109) arguments like this right so i had a  
[2:15:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8111) question about free will and how that uh  
[2:15:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8113) squared up with one of allah's  
[2:15:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8115) attributes right  
[2:15:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8116) so if allah is all-powerful over all  
[2:15:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8119) things right how would it be um wouldn't  
[2:15:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8122) it be contradictory to have a free will  
[2:15:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8126) for humans in any sort of way since  
[2:15:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8128) allah is powerful over all things and  
[2:15:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8130) humans are a thing as well so humans  
[2:15:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8133) having any degree of autonomy for  
[2:15:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8135) themselves how is that like how does  
[2:15:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8137) that square up and like the islamic  
[2:15:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8139) conception  
[2:15:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8142) so there's a number of ways to answer  
[2:15:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8144) this i'm sure the other brothers will  
[2:15:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8146) add their points as well but i lost  
[2:15:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8148) panel are having power and control over  
[2:15:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8150) all things  
[2:15:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8152) so for example my choice allah has power  
[2:15:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8155) and control over me in terms of even  
[2:15:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8157) when i make a free choice  
[2:15:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8159) uh maybe the analog the analogy that i  
[2:16:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8161) give is like if you have a child and the  
[2:16:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8164) child is next to a fire and the child  
[2:16:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8166) wants to put his hand into the fire and  
[2:16:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8168) the father is there then the father can  
[2:16:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8171) stop the child at any moment the father  
[2:16:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8173) still has that power to intervene at any  
[2:16:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8176) moment so if the child places the hand  
[2:16:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8179) into the fire then the child has done so  
[2:16:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8182) by the permission of the father yeah in  
[2:16:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8184) essence even though he was from the free  
[2:16:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8187) will of the child yeah so the same way  
[2:16:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8190) we can and take actions by our free will  
[2:16:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8192) but our actions that are done by our  
[2:16:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8194) free will are by the permission  
[2:16:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8197) by the permission of allah  
[2:16:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8199) so there's no contradiction in terms of  
[2:16:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8201) uh saying that allah is all powerful  
[2:16:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8204) and that we have free will  
[2:16:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8207) okay so um  
[2:16:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8210) can i ask like a follow-up question into  
[2:16:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8211) that yeah um  
[2:16:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8214) so if um  
[2:16:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8216) just so i can like get it straight in my  
[2:16:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8218) head and kind of understand it uh more  
[2:17:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8220) appropriately right so if allah is um  
[2:17:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8223) which allah is completely all-powerful  
[2:17:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8226) over all things in that analogy wouldn't  
[2:17:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8228) like  
[2:17:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8229) even the  
[2:17:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8230) child even having like the thought or  
[2:17:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8232) the will of even going towards the fire  
[2:17:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8235) right not the action itself but even the  
[2:17:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8237) will itself of going towards the fire  
[2:17:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8239) isn't that also completely controlled by  
[2:17:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8241) allah like determined by allah as well  
[2:17:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8244) and um  
[2:17:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8245) like because um the way i though  
[2:17:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8249) the answer i think you're basically  
[2:17:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8250) giving is like our will uh would not  
[2:17:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8253) exist if allah chose it to not exist  
[2:17:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8256) right but even us having a will by like  
[2:17:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8258) allah's permission right how is that  
[2:17:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8260) like possible because it's isn't it kind  
[2:17:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8263) of like how christians would say oh um  
[2:17:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8266) i chose uh like  
[2:17:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8268) something to happen uh like to give um  
[2:17:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8272) to  
[2:17:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8273) have a begotten son that is also god how  
[2:17:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8275) is that also like  
[2:17:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8277) i see  
[2:17:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8278) i see the i see it's a good it's a very  
[2:18:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8280) good question but that last part i don't  
[2:18:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8282) see how it's analogous i mean um  
[2:18:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8284) it's a good question because you're  
[2:18:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8285) asking about god's sovereignty over all  
[2:18:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8287) things  
[2:18:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8288) i but i don't see how it would be like  
[2:18:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8291) similar to god uh be getting a son i  
[2:18:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8294) guess um i guess it doesn't apply to uh  
[2:18:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8297) your answer but um other people's answer  
[2:18:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8299) is like um what some other people have  
[2:18:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8302) answered like to question is like um  
[2:18:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8304) allah chose for other uh chose for some  
[2:18:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8307) people to have a will that allah has no  
[2:18:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8310) control over right so allah relinquishes  
[2:18:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8312) his sovereignty over uh the human  
[2:18:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8315) being's will so isn't that yeah but  
[2:18:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8317) having a will is having a will is not  
[2:18:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8319) the same as being god i mean you can  
[2:18:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8321) have a will a free will without being  
[2:18:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8324) god it's not all what it takes is that's  
[2:18:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8326) not all it takes to be a god and  
[2:18:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8329) god  
[2:18:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8330) be getting a son that's that's  
[2:18:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8332) completely different that you're  
[2:18:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8333) basically god  
[2:18:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8335) sharing his divinity and that's that  
[2:18:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8337) results in certain contradictions if you  
[2:18:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8338) think for example that god is assay as  
[2:19:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8341) in god necessarily is exists of himself  
[2:19:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8344) then that's a contradiction in terms for  
[2:19:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8347) a  
[2:19:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8348) god to be begotten  
[2:19:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8349) because he needs to be  
[2:19:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8352) self-existing  
[2:19:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8353) but uh and so but in the case of free  
[2:19:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8355) will i mean you  
[2:19:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8357) i don't know you want to say that  
[2:19:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8358) everything that is a free agent  
[2:19:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8361) is god i don't think that's what you're  
[2:19:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8362) saying i don't think  
[2:19:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8363) it's true  
[2:19:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8367) let me explain what you're saying then  
[2:19:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8368) you can  
[2:19:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8369) you know you can maybe say that what i'm  
[2:19:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8371) explaining what you're trying to say is  
[2:19:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8372) this is that god is all-powerful and god  
[2:19:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8375) gives up power  
[2:19:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8378) to allow human beings to have free will  
[2:19:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8380) and you're saying therefore if god can  
[2:19:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8382) give up a portion of an attribute an  
[2:19:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8386) eternal attribute then why can't he give  
[2:19:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8389) up some other attributes  
[2:19:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8391) in order to become like man is that your  
[2:19:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8394) argument  
[2:19:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8395) exactly yeah yeah exactly so it's not  
[2:19:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8398) like why can't he it's like more like  
[2:20:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8401) we don't have any ground to go against  
[2:20:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8402) like the christian claim basically if we  
[2:20:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8404) say like if some speakers say like allah  
[2:20:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8406) gives up his power uh in order for  
[2:20:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8409) humans to have a free will then they  
[2:20:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8411) don't have any ground to like go against  
[2:20:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8413) christianity or like what christians say  
[2:20:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8415) it's just like a way more extreme  
[2:20:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8417) version of what they're saying yeah so  
[2:20:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8419) the difference is though is this is that  
[2:20:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8421) allah doesn't give up part of his power  
[2:20:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8424) so there's no power that's being given  
[2:20:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8426) up because at any moment allah can stop  
[2:20:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8430) us from having free will  
[2:20:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8432) so it's not like we are independent  
[2:20:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8434) agents that are able to do things even  
[2:20:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8438) in contradiction to what allah wants  
[2:20:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8442) yeah so we're never in that situation  
[2:20:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8444) all our abilities is derivative because  
[2:20:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8448) they're created from by allah so we  
[2:20:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8451) don't have any independent capability  
[2:20:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8454) if we had independent capability  
[2:20:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8456) i that we could just make choices even  
[2:20:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8459) in contradiction to what allah wants  
[2:21:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8462) then you would have an argument or they  
[2:21:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8464) would have an argument but we don't say  
[2:21:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8466) that we say we say that we have been  
[2:21:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8469) given this ability by allah as  
[2:21:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8472) contingent beings we have been created  
[2:21:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8474) with this ability by allah and allah any  
[2:21:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8477) moment can control and influence or take  
[2:21:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8480) it away from us  
[2:21:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8482) that we can therefore not do things  
[2:21:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8484) except by the permission of allah  
[2:21:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8487) okay okay that makes a lot of sense okay  
[2:21:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8490) so basically what you're trying to say  
[2:21:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8491) is that like our will our will is not  
[2:21:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8494) independent to allah as well it's just  
[2:21:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8496) mainta uh we have a degree of autonomy  
[2:21:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8499) but that autonomy is like maintained by  
[2:21:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8501) allah's power like allah could take it  
[2:21:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8503) take it away like any second he wants to  
[2:21:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8505) or like keep it like he does for us  
[2:21:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8508) right now okay yeah  
[2:21:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8510) so for for example if our will was to  
[2:21:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8513) conflict with his will at any point  
[2:21:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8515) allah has made it quite clear that we  
[2:21:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8517) will be judged based on our intentions  
[2:21:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8519) so you know it's like one of the first  
[2:22:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8521) well this is the first hadith in sahih  
[2:22:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8524) bukhari uh where he talks about you you  
[2:22:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8526) will be judged based on your intentions  
[2:22:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8528) so for example if you wanted to do  
[2:22:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8530) something and that came into conflict  
[2:22:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8532) with the will of allah he could override  
[2:22:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8535) that but then still you know um  
[2:22:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8539) hold you accountable for that so for  
[2:22:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8540) example if you want to murder an  
[2:22:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8542) innocent person  
[2:22:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8543) but you know circumstances arise because  
[2:22:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8546) that person is destined to do something  
[2:22:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8547) in the future um  
[2:22:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8549) where this um you know your plan is sort  
[2:22:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8552) of  
[2:22:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8553) uh  
[2:22:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8554) ruined or spoiled  
[2:22:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8556) um you still intended to do that you  
[2:22:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8558) would still you know had you've been  
[2:22:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8559) given the opportunity to do that would  
[2:22:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8561) have done it etc um so you know there's  
[2:22:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8564) ways of understanding that allah can  
[2:22:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8566) basically set things up with a  
[2:22:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8567) particular mechanism where you are  
[2:22:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8569) capable of having intention and trying  
[2:22:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8572) to act out  
[2:22:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8573) um and then judge you based on that and  
[2:22:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8576) okay  
[2:22:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8577) that makes sense and uh for like the  
[2:23:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8581) person that went before us i i that uh  
[2:23:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8583) the answer you guys gave for my question  
[2:23:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8585) makes sense uh but for the person that  
[2:23:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8587) uh went before us he was talking i think  
[2:23:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8590) he was the one that was talking about  
[2:23:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8591) like why does allah create anything if  
[2:23:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8593) he's like by himself isn't it just like  
[2:23:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8595) we say that like  
[2:23:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8597) instead like he's not adding to anything  
[2:23:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8599) he he has himself but he's just like  
[2:23:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8600) exhibiting his attributes like if he  
[2:23:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8603) creates humans he's not like becoming  
[2:23:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8605) merciful he's just like  
[2:23:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8607) enacting his mercy so it's not like  
[2:23:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8609) adding or subtracting anything from  
[2:23:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8610) himself  
[2:23:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8611) like i don't understand he's expressing  
[2:23:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8613) the attributes it's not the theme yeah  
[2:23:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8615) exactly yeah that's a possible  
[2:23:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8617) explanation so that's what we would say  
[2:23:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8619) it's not a necessary explanation but  
[2:23:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8622) it's a possible explanation people give  
[2:23:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8624) you  
[2:23:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8625) but i think the issue is is that from a  
[2:23:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8627) from a purely  
[2:23:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8629) from our perspective from this is the  
[2:23:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8630) problem with atheists is that they try  
[2:23:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8632) to say okay if god exists  
[2:23:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8634) god would create a world like this if  
[2:23:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8637) god if this world like this or god would  
[2:23:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8639) desire x if x doesn't ex  
[2:24:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8642) exist therefore god doesn't exist  
[2:24:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8644) they go from a very top down approach  
[2:24:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8647) whereas if you look at all of our  
[2:24:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8649) streams we go from a bottom up approach  
[2:24:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8652) we go from what we can sense and know  
[2:24:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8654) and then build the argument to that  
[2:24:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8656) there is a a necessary being that has a  
[2:24:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8658) will  
[2:24:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8659) whereas uh and and there's no nothing  
[2:24:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8662) contradictory does that but what you  
[2:24:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8664) find is that what atheists do they they  
[2:24:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8666) have a lot of baggage they have a lot of  
[2:24:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8667) presuppositions  
[2:24:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8669) assumptions that they already hold and  
[2:24:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8672) then they apply it to god and then  
[2:24:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8674) negate god yeah so the better way the  
[2:24:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8677) more rational way is try to remove or  
[2:24:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8680) minimize all your presuppositions and  
[2:24:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8682) look at based upon you know what we can  
[2:24:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8684) sense and build the argument up and then  
[2:24:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8687) you come to the conclusion now asking  
[2:24:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8689) the question why did god create well  
[2:24:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8692) yeah my mind is limited i'm not going to  
[2:24:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8694) fully understand that i might be able to  
[2:24:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8696) give some possible examples or possible  
[2:24:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8698) explanations but they're not going to be  
[2:25:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8701) uh definitive  
[2:25:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8703) uh  
[2:25:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8704) they're just simply like stories that we  
[2:25:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8705) can give and this is another point that  
[2:25:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8707) i probably wanted to mention earlier  
[2:25:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8709) which is  
[2:25:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8710) one of the ways to counteract a logical  
[2:25:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8713) contradiction when somebody says that  
[2:25:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8714) something's a contradiction  
[2:25:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8716) is all you have to do is give a possible  
[2:25:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8719) explanation  
[2:25:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8720) yeah to counteract it like i think you  
[2:25:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8723) also mentioned it earlier if you can  
[2:25:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8725) just give a counter to that position so  
[2:25:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8728) if you can just give a story and say  
[2:25:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8730) well here's an example of why something  
[2:25:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8733) could be you're not saying it is the  
[2:25:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8736) case you're just saying this is a  
[2:25:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8737) possible explanation and if you've got a  
[2:25:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8740) possible explanation you can't say it's  
[2:25:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8742) a contradiction anymore  
[2:25:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8744) okay  
[2:25:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8746) i think uh  
[2:25:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8747) we're going to go on to uh  
[2:25:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8750) our next caller we know yeah yeah

[2:26:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8779) never actually introduced myself so i  
[2:26:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8780) wanted to tell jake because he kind of  
[2:26:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8782) called me out about being a lawyer and  
[2:26:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8783) all that  
[2:26:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8784) so yes i'm a lawyer but i don't know  
[2:26:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8786) what country you guys are all from um  
[2:26:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8787) i'm a civil lawyer i don't do criminal  
[2:26:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8790) law so i'm not prosecution or defense i  
[2:26:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8792) do do plaintiff as you pointed out but i  
[2:26:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8795) sue people for breach of contract  
[2:26:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8798) so  
[2:26:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8800) yeah but even there you still have to  
[2:26:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8801) make arguments  
[2:26:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8803) yeah and i you probably i know you're  
[2:26:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8805) going to think i'm well i can't cause a  
[2:26:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8807) lot of client privilege tell you know  
[2:26:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8808) the details of what i do but i guarantee  
[2:26:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8810) you're going to say i'm lying if i told  
[2:26:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8811) you my win loss record i've won 40 000  
[2:26:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8815) cases and i've lost six  
[2:26:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8817) it's the truth  
[2:26:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8819) that's very worried  
[2:27:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8824) but that that's that makes me sound a  
[2:27:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8826) lot better than i am it's just because  
[2:27:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8827) the nature of my job i don't  
[2:27:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8829) bring a case unless i know i'm going to  
[2:27:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8830) win  
[2:27:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8831) so you know there was in those six there  
[2:27:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8833) is an unexpected surprise because i  
[2:27:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8835) review the case before i begin it so i  
[2:27:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8838) know that i'm going to win beforehand um  
[2:27:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8840) but yeah why don't you join here because  
[2:27:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8842) you know you're going to win  
[2:27:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8844) well i'd like to have a discussion more  
[2:27:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8845) so than a debate there's no one here  
[2:27:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8847) scoring points but um  
[2:27:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8849) i i mean i i'm i am  
[2:27:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8851) i i try to get i am an atheist so i try  
[2:27:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8853) to get into the mind of the theist  
[2:27:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8854) because i'm 34 years old and i've never  
[2:27:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8856) been able to understand it i've been an  
[2:27:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8857) atheist since i've been an adult um and  
[2:27:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8860) i don't get it  
[2:27:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8861) so but yeah let me why don't we ask the  
[2:27:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8864) two questions that i brought up in the  
[2:27:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8865) stream because that's why you guys  
[2:27:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8866) wanted me on and you seemed like  
[2:27:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8868) incredulous about them  
[2:27:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8869) um we could take either one they're two  
[2:27:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8871) different points i don't know which you  
[2:27:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8873) prefer you want me to receive them uh  
[2:27:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8876) yeah i think i don't think we're able to  
[2:27:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8878) bring it up because it's it's too far  
[2:28:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8880) gone now to be able to put on the screen  
[2:28:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8882) no that's okay um we so the first  
[2:28:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8885) there's two so the first one is  
[2:28:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8887) we don't start as humans in either  
[2:28:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8890) heaven nor hell we start on earth  
[2:28:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8893) i've been told the explanation for this  
[2:28:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8894) is that we are being tested  
[2:28:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8896) by god to see which one of the two we're  
[2:28:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8898) going to end up in  
[2:28:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8900) but it's a pointless test if he already  
[2:28:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8902) knows the outcome what's why run the  
[2:28:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8903) test if you know the outcome where he's  
[2:28:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8905) predestined us to go to heaven or hell  
[2:28:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8907) the other related uh contradiction is  
[2:28:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8910) if you read the quran and i brought this  
[2:28:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8912) up last time i was on uh surah 2 6 2 2  
[2:28:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8915) 12 it says  
[2:28:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8917) okay we're gonna maybe we'll have a  
[2:28:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8918) fight about interpretation my  
[2:28:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8920) interpretation of that and the  
[2:28:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8921) interpretation of many early muslims was  
[2:28:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8923) that it predestines people so he he  
[2:28:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8926) knows  
[2:28:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8928) actually  
[2:28:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8930) 2 6 through 2 12. okay matthew let's  
[2:28:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8932) let's take the first one so you said the  
[2:28:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8934) first one is a contradiction  
[2:28:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8936) how do you define a contradiction are  
[2:28:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8938) you saying it's a logical contradiction  
[2:29:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8940) because the point of a test is is i  
[2:29:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8943) don't know the outcome i need to run a  
[2:29:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8945) test to see what the outcome will be but  
[2:29:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8946) he already knows the outcome so why is  
[2:29:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8948) he running the test but how do you def  
[2:29:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8950) before we talk about the specific  
[2:29:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8952) example how do you define a logical  
[2:29:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8954) contradiction because our stream today  
[2:29:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8956) primarily is about how how we understand  
[2:29:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8959) what is a logical country or logical  
[2:29:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8961) impossibility uh which is results in a  
[2:29:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8963) logical contradiction so how do you  
[2:29:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8965) understand what a logical contradiction  
[2:29:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8967) is  
[2:29:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8967) um  
[2:29:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8968) we could go into identity  
[2:29:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8970) non-contradiction and excluded middle  
[2:29:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8971) the aristotelian laws of thought if  
[2:29:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8974) something violates that that would be a  
[2:29:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8975) logical contradiction okay so the free  
[2:29:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8978) classical laws you're saying if it  
[2:29:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8980) violates one of the three classical laws  
[2:29:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8982) it's a logical contradiction  
[2:29:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8984) yeah that's  
[2:29:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8985) yeah i mean in your standard way i mean  
[2:29:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8987) you're talking about identity and  
[2:29:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8988) equivocation a and not a  
[2:29:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8991) as aristotle  
[2:29:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8993) so  
[2:29:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8994) so in this situation are you arguing as  
[2:29:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=8997) are you claiming there's an internal  
[2:30:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9000) contradiction or are you using some  
[2:30:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9002) external criteria  
[2:30:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9004) to demonstrate a contradiction well why  
[2:30:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9006) don't i lay it out and you can tell me  
[2:30:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9007) if it's valid and sound no no i'm asking  
[2:30:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9010) you i'm asking what your position is are  
[2:30:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9012) you saying this is an internal  
[2:30:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9013) contradiction this is what islam says as  
[2:30:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9016) one proposition  
[2:30:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9018) there's another proposition and this  
[2:30:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9020) proposition contradicts this the  
[2:30:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9022) original proposition is that what you're  
[2:30:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9024) saying  
[2:30:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9025) or are you saying  
[2:30:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9026) these propositions contradict this  
[2:30:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9029) so this this the belief sets of islam  
[2:30:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9033) the propositions that islam has  
[2:30:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9035) contradicts a further proposition which  
[2:30:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9038) we think is necessary yeah i a necessary  
[2:30:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9042) proposition and therefore it's a  
[2:30:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9044) contradiction even though this necessary  
[2:30:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9046) proposition is not actually explicitly  
[2:30:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9049) mentioned within the quran or within the  
[2:30:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9051) within islam  
[2:30:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9053) do you see the difference between yeah i  
[2:30:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9054) do it's the first one it's islam says a  
[2:30:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9056) and islam says not a okay so it's an  
[2:30:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9059) internal contradiction  
[2:31:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9060) so in this internal contradiction you're  
[2:31:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9064) saying that god  
[2:31:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9065) tests human beings  
[2:31:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9067) but god knows  
[2:31:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9069) what the what the end of that test is  
[2:31:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9072) therefore the test is pointless  
[2:31:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9074) therefore he wouldn't do the test but he  
[2:31:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9075) does the test anyway okay so when you  
[2:31:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9078) said the test is pointless  
[2:31:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9080) you're now going away from an internal  
[2:31:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9082) critique but why don't i give you the  
[2:31:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9084) logical form  
[2:31:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9086) because  
[2:31:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9087) you know as well  
[2:31:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9088) before you do it  
[2:31:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9090) so this notion that it's pointless it is  
[2:31:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9093) not true because it is related to  
[2:31:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9095) justice so for example  
[2:31:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9097) you can punish someone for something or  
[2:31:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9101) um praise someone for something if  
[2:31:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9103) they've not done it so on the day of  
[2:31:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9104) judgement it talks about showing you  
[2:31:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9106) your account and holding you accountable  
[2:31:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9108) so you know  
[2:31:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9110) you if he was just to for example  
[2:31:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9113) creators and then  
[2:31:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9115) just throws in to hellfire or paradise  
[2:31:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9118) without actually having done the action  
[2:32:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9121) then there is no relation to justice it  
[2:32:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9123) was like well  
[2:32:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9124) you know i didn't actually do that  
[2:32:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9126) however by allowing creation to begin  
[2:32:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9129) and then obviously to play out and for  
[2:32:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9130) the tests to  
[2:32:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9132) happen  
[2:32:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9133) then there is a justice in in terms of  
[2:32:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9139) well if i can just respond to that first  
[2:32:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9141) place but the problem is we're gonna  
[2:32:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9143) the thing is this stream is about  
[2:32:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9145) logical contradictions logic right and  
[2:32:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9148) you came in saying that you know you  
[2:32:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9150) you think there is a position that's  
[2:32:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9152) contradictory in islam now you have to  
[2:32:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9154) you say and you literally said a and not  
[2:32:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9156) a so you have to show where a and not a  
[2:32:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9159) saying the test is pointless even if  
[2:32:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9161) it's pointless doesn't demonstrate a  
[2:32:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9163) contradiction so where is like there is  
[2:32:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9166) a point to the test  
[2:32:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9168) and then there is it's pointless i mean  
[2:32:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9169) you need to the problem is a lot of  
[2:32:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9172) atheists come on these streams and you  
[2:32:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9173) know atheists do  
[2:32:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9175) have this this this uh this mindset  
[2:32:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9177) these days that you know atheism or new  
[2:33:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9180) atheism is about evidence and  
[2:33:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9182) enlightenment right and you know  
[2:33:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9184) intellectual capacity  
[2:33:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9186) but the problem is  
[2:33:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9188) these claims you're making there's a way  
[2:33:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9191) to show  
[2:33:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9192) they're true there's a way to falsify  
[2:33:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9194) them right now i think you need to know  
[2:33:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9196) that way if you don't know that way then  
[2:33:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9198) it  
[2:33:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9200) yeah it defeats the purpose of  
[2:33:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9202) by these by the by the new atheist  
[2:33:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9204) standards being an atheist who is  
[2:33:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9206) enlightened and basically knows what  
[2:33:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9207) he's talking about and only he speaks  
[2:33:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9209) based on evidence and has reasonable  
[2:33:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9211) positions so if you're going to come on  
[2:33:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9213) the stream and say there is a logical  
[2:33:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9214) contradiction the least you can do is  
[2:33:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9217) present a  
[2:33:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9219) valid deductive syllogism premise  
[2:33:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9222) premise conclusion that is logically  
[2:33:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9224) valid that is formally valid i mean if  
[2:33:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9226) you can't do that then i just think that  
[2:33:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9229) we're going to keep going  
[2:33:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9231) i don't i've offered to do it twice so  
[2:33:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9233) when you re-run this you do it let me do  
[2:33:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9235) it go ahead do it premise premise  
[2:33:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9237) conclusion  
[2:33:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9238) premise one the purpose of a test is to  
[2:34:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9240) determine an outcome  
[2:34:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9242) do we we're not going to get past that  
[2:34:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9245) no false  
[2:34:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9247) because now it's no longer an it's an  
[2:34:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9249) internal critique right yeah that's  
[2:34:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9252) false we would disagree with that  
[2:34:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9254) so so so what is your definition of test  
[2:34:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9258) the test doesn't necessarily have to be  
[2:34:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9260) for the tester it could be for the one  
[2:34:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9262) that's tested  
[2:34:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9264) what difference does that mean  
[2:34:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9266) because it's not to know what the person  
[2:34:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9269) is going to do necessarily  
[2:34:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9271) so when i run a test in a laboratory i  
[2:34:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9274) combine two chemicals and i want to see  
[2:34:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9275) what's going to happen when they combine  
[2:34:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9277) is the point not to see what happens the  
[2:34:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9280) outcome that's called we would define  
[2:34:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9282) that as a test yeah but what you're  
[2:34:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9284) doing is you're using your own  
[2:34:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9286) definition of you're  
[2:34:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9289) not the definition of a test no i'm  
[2:34:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9291) saying it's not when i go into my car  
[2:34:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9294) emissions they test to see what the  
[2:34:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9295) emissions are they have to run the test  
[2:34:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9296) to see how much emissions coming from my  
[2:34:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9298) car  
[2:35:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9300) you can read what's on the screen so  
[2:35:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9302) anyway we reject your definition so  
[2:35:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9304) straight off the bat your argument's not  
[2:35:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9306) going to work so you're just rejecting  
[2:35:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9307) my definition by assertion can you show  
[2:35:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9309) me  
[2:35:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9310) you're asserting that it means that  
[2:35:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9313) you're asserting that that's the only  
[2:35:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9314) possible way to  
[2:35:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9315) disprove it okay i just didn't i just  
[2:35:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9318) did  
[2:35:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9319) so  
[2:35:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9321) are you admitting that it's one  
[2:35:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9322) definition matt like for example i knew  
[2:35:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9324) that you were gonna come on here and  
[2:35:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9326) come with a silly argument but it's  
[2:35:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9328) still a test  
[2:35:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9331) what  
[2:35:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9331) i knew you were going to come on here  
[2:35:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9333) with a silly argument and you're still  
[2:35:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9336) being tested  
[2:35:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9339) so knowledge doesn't negate a test  
[2:35:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9344) go back to your first premise again go  
[2:35:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9345) back to your first premise  
[2:35:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9348) the point of the test  
[2:35:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9350) is to determine an outcome an outcome  
[2:35:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9353) that you don't already know  
[2:35:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9354) so  
[2:35:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9355) so do you understand why we why we  
[2:35:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9357) reject  
[2:35:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9358) that that is a necessary  
[2:36:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9362) definition of a test  
[2:36:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9365) as long as it's one definition i can  
[2:36:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9367) still run the rest of the argument no  
[2:36:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9369) because if it's one definition it's no  
[2:36:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9371) longer it's no longer  
[2:36:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9373) a logical contradiction it's a it's a  
[2:36:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9376) presupposition it's a it's an assumption  
[2:36:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9379) that this  
[2:36:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9380) definition is the only definition that  
[2:36:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9383) i'm going to use even though there are  
[2:36:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9385) other definitions that could be used so  
[2:36:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9388) what is the definition of a test for us  
[2:36:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9390) being on this earth in islam  
[2:36:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9393) so what was the definition of the test  
[2:36:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9396) so that we as human beings can undertake  
[2:36:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9399) actions which are halal haram or  
[2:36:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9402) undertake actions with your belief or  
[2:36:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9403) disbelief so we're using the same  
[2:36:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9405) definition so i'm fine  
[2:36:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9407) we are being human beings so wait a  
[2:36:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9410) minute so look what you're doing here  
[2:36:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9412) you're you're using my definition and  
[2:36:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9414) you're saying that it's a that's still a  
[2:36:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9416) problem  
[2:36:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9417) no because you're you're trying to apply  
[2:36:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9419) this upon god you're saying well god  
[2:37:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9421) would not set out the test  
[2:37:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9424) if god knew the answer to it yeah  
[2:37:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9427) now what jake said is that tests  
[2:37:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9430) sometimes are not for the one who gives  
[2:37:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9432) the test sometimes the test is for the  
[2:37:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9435) one who takes the test  
[2:37:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9437) yeah and i say why does that matter if  
[2:37:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9439) god knows the outcome anyway he  
[2:37:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9441) predetermined the way that i'm going to  
[2:37:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9443) take the test  
[2:37:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9444) so like so for example in college yeah i  
[2:37:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9448) had a science teacher  
[2:37:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9449) and he'd been a science teacher for many  
[2:37:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9451) years and he'd been doing these tests  
[2:37:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9453) for many years and he knew exactly what  
[2:37:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9454) was going to occur at the end of the  
[2:37:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9456) tests  
[2:37:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9457) but he still had us  
[2:37:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9459) do the tests  
[2:37:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9461) despite him knowing what the outcome was  
[2:37:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9463) so he i don't know if he you say he know  
[2:37:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9466) he knew exactly that would that would be  
[2:37:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9467) a miracle  
[2:37:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9468) he had a he had a good guess he didn't  
[2:37:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9470) know exactly but you believe that god  
[2:37:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9472) knows exactly  
[2:37:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9473) no he's explaining that further  
[2:37:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9475) yeah so like he was a science teacher he  
[2:37:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9478) said if you drop  
[2:38:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9480) this penny it's going to fall a  
[2:38:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9483) particular rate  
[2:38:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9485) now  
[2:38:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9486) and then we did the tests to prove that  
[2:38:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9489) so those are still tests despite the  
[2:38:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9491) answers being known  
[2:38:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9493) yeah  
[2:38:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9494) that's different that's important that  
[2:38:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9496) what he was doing was demonstrating  
[2:38:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9498) something  
[2:38:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9499) he's trying to teach people  
[2:38:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9501) with a test yeah  
[2:38:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9504) i mean guys let's let's cut to the chase  
[2:38:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9505) the idea is matthew your your your  
[2:38:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9508) argument would be formal i didn't hear  
[2:38:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9510) the second premise of the conclusion but  
[2:38:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9512) assuming that  
[2:38:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9513) yeah yeah yeah so assuming that you're  
[2:38:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9515) going to show that it has to be to you  
[2:38:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9517) know  
[2:38:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9518) to determine the result and then you  
[2:38:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9520) derive from that a contradiction it will  
[2:38:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9523) it would be formally valid and it would  
[2:38:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9525) work for someone who accepts your  
[2:38:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9527) definition but definitions aren't that  
[2:38:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9529) rigid i mean the the idea is the concept  
[2:38:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9532) of a test  
[2:38:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9533) nothing in the concept of a test  
[2:38:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9536) necessitates  
[2:38:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9538) ignorance about the outcome nothing  
[2:39:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9540) there's not there's no if there's no  
[2:39:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9542) logical direct logical connection  
[2:39:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9545) there's no entailment relation between  
[2:39:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9548) you know the idea the concept of a test  
[2:39:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9551) and your knowledge of the outcome you  
[2:39:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9553) can initiative  
[2:39:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9555) you yeah on this definition fine so if i  
[2:39:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9557) accepted your definition i'd say yeah  
[2:39:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9559) that that that would be a contradictory  
[2:39:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9561) no the question is did you accept my  
[2:39:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9562) definition because sharif is saying that  
[2:39:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9564) the point of us being on the planet is  
[2:39:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9566) to see if we do the good things or the  
[2:39:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9567) bad things so that seems like we're  
[2:39:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9569) looking for that outcome no not to see  
[2:39:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9571) he's not saying so god can see he says  
[2:39:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9573) it's and and jake explained that the  
[2:39:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9575) test can be more for you know uh uh the  
[2:39:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9578) person who's being tested then then the  
[2:39:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9579) tester i'm just saying that in order for  
[2:39:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9582) you to  
[2:39:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9583) to bring this to a logical contradiction  
[2:39:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9585) matthew you you shouldn't rely on  
[2:39:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9589) you're the basis of your argument  
[2:39:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9590) shouldn't rely on a definition that can  
[2:39:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9592) really go either way we have we're  
[2:39:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9594) coming from different places unless you  
[2:39:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9595) agree with my definition because if you  
[2:39:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9597) agree with my definition then you're  
[2:39:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9598) just making something  
[2:40:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9600) we don't we explain that we don't so  
[2:40:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9602) okay so but wait that's the part i need  
[2:40:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9604) to know why i need to know why you don't  
[2:40:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9606) agree so so so matthew if you're doing  
[2:40:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9608) an internal critique and you're trying  
[2:40:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9610) to derive a contradiction from within  
[2:40:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9611) the islamic paradigm then you should  
[2:40:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9614) understand what the islamic conception  
[2:40:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9616) of a test is and you  
[2:40:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9618) clearly would see that god testing  
[2:40:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9621) humans doesn't mean that god doesn't  
[2:40:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9623) know what humans will do because we  
[2:40:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9624) believe in foreknowledge you're saying  
[2:40:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9626) that it's a contradictory position  
[2:40:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9629) because of your presumption that this  
[2:40:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9632) these two things for knowledge and  
[2:40:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9634) testing are impossible you know to be  
[2:40:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9637) like contracts with one another but  
[2:40:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9638) that's not really the muslim position so  
[2:40:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9641) right now it's not gonna really be an  
[2:40:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9642) argument about like it's gonna be an  
[2:40:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9644) argument about the definition and  
[2:40:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9646) there's no reason why we have to accept  
[2:40:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9649) your very narrow definition as opposed  
[2:40:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9652) to us just merely saying that there's no  
[2:40:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9654) necessity there's no necessity for  
[2:40:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9658) ignorance in the concept of a test it  
[2:41:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9660) doesn't necessitate that you're ignorant  
[2:41:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9662) about the outcome we're not even we're  
[2:41:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9663) not even saying yeah some tests when  
[2:41:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9666) some tests you can be ignorant in fact  
[2:41:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9668) maybe even we can tell you even most of  
[2:41:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9670) them from our experience yes but some  
[2:41:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9673) the the idea is in a logical argument  
[2:41:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9676) you have to show that it's either all or  
[2:41:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9678) nothing right you can you can you can  
[2:41:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9681) make a case for why it's more likely  
[2:41:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9684) that all tests should require or should  
[2:41:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9687) should preclude the idea for knowledge  
[2:41:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9690) but we're not going to accept that i  
[2:41:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9691) mean and and really how are you going to  
[2:41:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9693) show that how are you going to  
[2:41:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9693) demonstrate you're giving an answer  
[2:41:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9695) without an explanation you're not saying  
[2:41:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9697) you're not explaining why then god would  
[2:41:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9699) do the test we just we gave you we gave  
[2:41:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9700) you several i mean yousuf gave you  
[2:41:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9702) several examples  
[2:41:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9704) knowing the result of uh you know a test  
[2:41:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9708) but still doing it yes but why  
[2:41:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9711) you could what do you mean what do you  
[2:41:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9712) mean  
[2:41:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9715) so god started the ball rolling he  
[2:41:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9717) created everything so it was his  
[2:41:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9718) decision to give the test he already  
[2:42:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9721) knows what's going to happen so why is  
[2:42:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9722) he giving the test  
[2:42:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9724) because it's a building for free  
[2:42:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9726) creatures  
[2:42:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9728) but we're not free  
[2:42:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9730) yeah  
[2:42:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9742) saying that if you know something that  
[2:42:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9743) the person is not free  
[2:42:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9745) that's what i'm saying you're not you're  
[2:42:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9746) not it's a two-step process let me just  
[2:42:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9748) explain this because you guys you guys  
[2:42:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9750) say this all the time and you're not  
[2:42:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9751) getting it it's a two-step process god  
[2:42:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9754) creates step one  
[2:42:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9756) god knows the future step two it's not  
[2:42:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9758) just step two it's step one he creates  
[2:42:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9761) knowing that he creates he's set in  
[2:42:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9763) motion the outcome  
[2:42:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9765) yeah but just because he creates doesn't  
[2:42:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9766) mean that we're not free that's the  
[2:42:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9768) point  
[2:42:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9770) really i just explained why it is so  
[2:42:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9772) this is  
[2:42:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9773) conclusion that's not god knows god  
[2:42:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9776) knows what's going to happen  
[2:42:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9777) he sets the chain in motion therefore  
[2:43:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9780) we're not free matthew before we go into  
[2:43:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9782) another argument yeah this is a  
[2:43:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9783) different argument  
[2:43:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9785) do you understand what abdul rahman's  
[2:43:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9786) saying he's saying that when you say  
[2:43:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9788) something's a logical contradiction and  
[2:43:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9791) you're using  
[2:43:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9792) the definition of a word  
[2:43:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9794) you have to demonstrate that the word  
[2:43:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9796) test  
[2:43:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9797) entails your definition like for example  
[2:43:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9800) if i say a married bachelor is a logical  
[2:43:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9803) contradiction it's because the word  
[2:43:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9806) married and bachelor they entail a  
[2:43:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9809) contradiction now you're giving a  
[2:43:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9811) definition of the word test a possible  
[2:43:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9814) definition that's not entailed by the  
[2:43:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9817) word test  
[2:43:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9819) yeah so you're not giving a logical  
[2:43:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9822) contradiction by using a possible  
[2:43:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9825) definition that's not entailed  
[2:43:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9827) necessarily by definition yeah i get all  
[2:43:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9831) of that and i still haven't heard why  
[2:43:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9833) you don't agree with my definition  
[2:43:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9834) merely you're just asserting you don't  
[2:43:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9836) agree with it but you're not just giving  
[2:43:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9838) me the actual reason give you examples  
[2:44:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9840) why i give you yeah  
[2:44:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9842) you just gave me an exam the closest one  
[2:44:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9844) of you gave me an example was yusuf  
[2:44:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9845) about the coin flip or the dropping the  
[2:44:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9847) coin no no but that but the his  
[2:44:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9850) professor had a different reason for  
[2:44:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9851) doing this so that's what i'm looking  
[2:44:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9852) for what is god's reason for the test  
[2:44:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9854) then so his the professor's reason was  
[2:44:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9856) to demonstrate the effect of gravity  
[2:44:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9858) matthew matthew so  
[2:44:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9860) you said at the beginning that you're  
[2:44:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9862) doing an internal critique to  
[2:44:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9864) demonstrate a clear logical  
[2:44:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9866) contradiction yeah  
[2:44:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9868) so the onus of the proof the onus of  
[2:44:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9873) substantiating that is now on you  
[2:44:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9875) matthew  
[2:44:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9876) so you have to now do the work  
[2:44:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9879) yeah to demonstrate a logical  
[2:44:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9881) contradiction  
[2:44:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9882) now if you demonstrate an apparent  
[2:44:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9885) logical contradiction then we have to do  
[2:44:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9888) the work in order to demonstrate a  
[2:44:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9890) possible explanation to demonstrate that  
[2:44:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9893) it's not a logical contradiction  
[2:44:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9896) you haven't done the work yet because  
[2:44:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9898) you failed in the first part which is to  
[2:45:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9900) say that the test  
[2:45:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9903) necess necessarily entails this  
[2:45:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9906) definition you agreed that the word test  
[2:45:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9908) does not necessarily entail a particular  
[2:45:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9911) or one particular definition so as a  
[2:45:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9914) result you're not creating a logical  
[2:45:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9917) contradiction at this moment in time  
[2:45:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9920) it's not for us now to give a definition  
[2:45:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9922) of the word test  
[2:45:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9925) it is a logical contradiction if you  
[2:45:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9927) accept my definition so i still don't  
[2:45:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9928) you just that's where you disagree so  
[2:45:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9930) it's fine yeah  
[2:45:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9932) if we accept it but are we  
[2:45:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9935) are we are obligated by logical  
[2:45:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9938) necessity to accept that definition  
[2:45:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9943) you  
[2:45:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9944) so you're i'm going to say yes and then  
[2:45:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9946) you're going to say well  
[2:45:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9950) matt is your definition of a test the  
[2:45:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9952) same thing as a triangle having three  
[2:45:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9954) angles  
[2:45:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9956) no okay so they're not on equal playing  
[2:45:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9958) field that's the point  
[2:45:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9959) yeah so your your your definition of a  
[2:46:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9962) test is not we don't need to accept it  
[2:46:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9964) by logical necessity in the same way  
[2:46:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9967) that triangle has three sides but the  
[2:46:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9969) point is  
[2:46:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9970) you're only asserting that you don't  
[2:46:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9972) accept the definition we gave you  
[2:46:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9974) reasons why  
[2:46:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9975) we gave you reasons why but you might  
[2:46:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9977) not like it but  
[2:46:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9979) i heard you but i don't understand any  
[2:46:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9981) of the other  
[2:46:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9983) because why did god i guess  
[2:46:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9985) two there's two issues here the first  
[2:46:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9988) issue matthew is  
[2:46:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9989) you have to show that the word test  
[2:46:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9992) entails your definition  
[2:46:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9995) if you have said that your the word test  
[2:46:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=9998) does not entail your definition it's  
[2:46:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10000) only a possible definition  
[2:46:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10003) then that's it game over you can't  
[2:46:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10006) demonstrate that it's a logical it's a  
[2:46:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10007) very glass half half empty uh  
[2:46:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10011) if if my definition is sometimes correct  
[2:46:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10013) why does it have to be universal if it's  
[2:46:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10015) sometimes correct at least i've made a  
[2:46:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10016) valid argument that's it that's the  
[2:46:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10018) point though that means it's possible  
[2:47:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10020) it's not necessary possible  
[2:47:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10022) so what  
[2:47:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10024) means  
[2:47:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10029) over here that i it still weighs on the  
[2:47:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10032) scales i just made a valid and  
[2:47:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10034) potentially sound argument that weakens  
[2:47:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10036) your position  
[2:47:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10037) no now  
[2:47:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10040) matt we're not talking about weakening  
[2:47:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10042) or strengthening i think you think  
[2:47:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10043) you're in the courtroom you're not in  
[2:47:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10045) the courtroom the scale doesn't exist  
[2:47:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10047) you need to come down and smash the  
[2:47:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10049) scale into pieces and say it's not there  
[2:47:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10051) that's why  
[2:47:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10052) in a courtroom people's  
[2:47:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10054) entire lives and livelihoods are on the  
[2:47:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10056) line it's a very important burden of  
[2:47:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10058) evidence that is used there let me know  
[2:47:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10060) this is ivory tower logic which is fine  
[2:47:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10062) i like that too but  
[2:47:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10064) there one has much graver consequences  
[2:47:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10067) yeah let me help you out yeah yeah it  
[2:47:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10068) does what you're doing you're you're  
[2:47:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10071) doing is you're not trying to  
[2:47:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10072) demonstrate a logical contradiction  
[2:47:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10074) that's first you're not doing that yeah  
[2:47:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10077) that's quite clear  
[2:47:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10078) but what you can say is i'm giving a  
[2:48:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10082) metaphysical argument to demonstrate the  
[2:48:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10085) impossibility yeah here's my  
[2:48:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10087) presuppositions  
[2:48:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10089) yeah which are possible  
[2:48:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10091) or i'm giving an evidential argument  
[2:48:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10093) against your position of tests that's  
[2:48:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10095) what you should be saying is an  
[2:48:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10097) evidential argument yeah  
[2:48:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10100) not a logical contradiction  
[2:48:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10103) because logical contradiction entails  
[2:48:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10104) that this the proposition not only  
[2:48:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10107) results in a contradiction but it  
[2:48:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10109) becomes a meaningless proposition  
[2:48:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10111) whereas what you have to say  
[2:48:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10113) is no it's not going to result in a  
[2:48:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10115) logical uh you know a meaningless  
[2:48:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10117) proposition or meaning sentences  
[2:48:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10119) rather it's an evidential argument here  
[2:48:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10122) is what i assume to be true i think i  
[2:48:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10125) have evidence of why i think it to be  
[2:48:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10128) true  
[2:48:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10128) and that's why i discount x but the  
[2:48:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10132) problem is what what you're saying is a  
[2:48:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10135) married bachelor is only a contradiction  
[2:48:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10137) if the uh word bachelor means unmarried  
[2:49:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10140) and even though it has other definitions  
[2:49:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10142) but we use that as an example all the  
[2:49:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10144) time if it doesn't have other  
[2:49:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10145) definitions but matt we'll give you  
[2:49:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10147) about five more minutes and then we're  
[2:49:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10149) going to have to go to the next person  
[2:49:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10151) if you've got a problem with the word  
[2:49:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10152) bachelor you can say uh as a four-sided  
[2:49:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10155) triangle yeah yeah so if someone comes  
[2:49:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10158) and disagrees with your definition of  
[2:49:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10160) bachelor and they add some they they you  
[2:49:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10162) know add some nuance to the definition  
[2:49:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10170) here's the point the point is what we're  
[2:49:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10173) disagreeing with is the idea that  
[2:49:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10177) tests always have to be the way you're  
[2:49:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10180) explaining them always have to go by  
[2:49:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10183) your definition  
[2:49:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10185) we agree you have reason to assume that  
[2:49:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10188) you know  
[2:49:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10189) some tests should be  
[2:49:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10191) you know carried out in this way where  
[2:49:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10193) you don't know the outcome so like you  
[2:49:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10195) gave the example of you know doing  
[2:49:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10196) science tests in a lab you don't know  
[2:49:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10198) the outcome you're doing tests to see  
[2:49:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10199) the result fine in that context yes but  
[2:50:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10202) that doesn't mean that every kind of  
[2:50:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10204) test because this is a very  
[2:50:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10206) different kind of test right that  
[2:50:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10208) doesn't mean that every kind of test  
[2:50:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10211) you know requires this aspect of  
[2:50:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10214) ignorance it's just not well that's not  
[2:50:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10216) that's necessary that last sentence  
[2:50:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10217) there is what i don't understand why  
[2:50:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10218) this is a different kind of test but  
[2:50:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10220) okay so again so spiritual so so soul  
[2:50:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10223) building for example right so if if you  
[2:50:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10225) have a case where  
[2:50:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10228) you will put someone through  
[2:50:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10230) a  
[2:50:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10231) certain difficulties and this person is  
[2:50:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10233) going to spiritually grow  
[2:50:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10236) through these difficulties it doesn't  
[2:50:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10238) that doesn't mean that you know  
[2:50:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10240) necessarily you must be ignorant of the  
[2:50:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10243) outcome you can know the outcome is good  
[2:50:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10245) for example you can know the outcome is  
[2:50:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10247) good and still put them through that  
[2:50:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10249) test because you know okay at the end of  
[2:50:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10251) the test they're going to come out a  
[2:50:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10252) better person so even though i know  
[2:50:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10254) they're going to come out a better  
[2:50:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10256) person well i'm just going to go ahead  
[2:50:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10257) with the test  
[2:50:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10258) because there's an omnipotent god who  
[2:51:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10260) could cut to the chase by snapping his  
[2:51:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10262) finger and then we're in heaven with the  
[2:51:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10263) soul that he wants  
[2:51:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10266) he's about three creatures it's about  
[2:51:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10267) freedom yeah he's being able to exercise  
[2:51:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10270) so that's why i brought up my second  
[2:51:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10271) point i don't know where right now  
[2:51:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10274) right now that's not the point the point  
[2:51:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10276) is the point is we want to give you  
[2:51:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10278) counter examples for the idea that every  
[2:51:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10281) time there is a test there cannot be  
[2:51:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10283) foreknowledge there must be ignorance  
[2:51:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10285) and i just told you i just gave you a  
[2:51:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10287) scenario where i know that a certain  
[2:51:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10289) test will make somebody grow as a person  
[2:51:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10293) right and i can know the outcome of that  
[2:51:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10295) assume i have foreknowledge of it and  
[2:51:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10297) and i can still do it so i don't i don't  
[2:51:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10299) know if human beings ever have complete  
[2:51:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10301) foreign but bro you need to when we're  
[2:51:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10304) doing when we're doing philosophy you  
[2:51:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10305) give a lot of these thought experiments  
[2:51:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10307) and sometimes it doesn't have to  
[2:51:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10309) necessarily reflect  
[2:51:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10311) human reality so you can give and i like  
[2:51:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10313) you could just grant for the sake of  
[2:51:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10315) arguing just as a thought experiment  
[2:51:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10316) that there is a person who knows the  
[2:51:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10318) future and he knows that if his son for  
[2:52:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10321) example goes through a particular test  
[2:52:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10323) he will be a better person  
[2:52:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10325) does that mean that you know oh wait i  
[2:52:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10327) know the future so i'm not going to put  
[2:52:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10328) him through the test and make him a  
[2:52:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10330) better person that would be ridiculous  
[2:52:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10336) well i think it very much depends on who  
[2:52:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10338) starts the ball rolling  
[2:52:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10340) and that is this that is a point that  
[2:52:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10342) you guys constantly ignore and i just i  
[2:52:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10343) have five minutes  
[2:52:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10345) why does that make a difference because  
[2:52:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10346) it's perfectly analogous oh god  
[2:52:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10348) who is who is who is cause who is the  
[2:52:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10351) verb who is doing the action here is it  
[2:52:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10354) god or the person this that's a  
[2:52:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10356) different argument right now so right  
[2:52:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10357) now we're trying to establish that tests  
[2:52:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10360) necessitate ignorance of the outcome of  
[2:52:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10362) the test right we're trying to establish  
[2:52:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10364) that part of your argument you're taking  
[2:52:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10365) it right now to free will right so free  
[2:52:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10368) will is a different discussion that's a  
[2:52:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10370) different contradiction from your  
[2:52:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10372) perspective that we can talk about some  
[2:52:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10373) other time but right now you just need  
[2:52:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10375) to establish your first premise because  
[2:52:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10377) your first premise isn't even getting  
[2:52:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10378) off the ground because we're  
[2:53:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10380) continuously giving you counter examples  
[2:53:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10382) where it is okay so i will  
[2:53:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10385) test i will take then  
[2:53:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10387) i will take what sharif said i've  
[2:53:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10389) provided evidence against your existence  
[2:53:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10391) of god just not proof because i couldn't  
[2:53:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10392) do a and not a i just piled styled  
[2:53:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10395) evidence because you admitted that even  
[2:53:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10397) more than more frequently than not a  
[2:53:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10399) test is to determine its outcome okay  
[2:53:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10401) the evidence evidence is by the way  
[2:53:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10403) evidence can be a deceiving word because  
[2:53:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10404) there can be bad evidence like for  
[2:53:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10406) example i could have  
[2:53:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10407) evidence for  
[2:53:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10409) bigfoot it could still be it's still  
[2:53:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10412) evidence it just doesn't have to be good  
[2:53:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10413) evidence the evidence doesn't  
[2:53:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10416) necessarily mean that the conclu what i  
[2:53:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10419) think the conclusion of the evidence is  
[2:53:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10420) is reasonable you know i think it's  
[2:53:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10422) incredible  
[2:53:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10424) yeah yeah evidence is basically a reason  
[2:53:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10426) to believe something something that  
[2:53:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10428) makes a proposition more likely so  
[2:53:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10431) that's true so you can have evidence for  
[2:53:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10433) all kinds of unreasonable stuff it's  
[2:53:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10435) still evidence but it can be bad  
[2:53:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10437) evidence so let's see if you guys can  
[2:53:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10438) defeat this one a test is sometimes and  
[2:54:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10441) perhaps most frequently defined as an  
[2:54:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10444) experiment which people  
[2:54:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10446) undertake where they don't know the  
[2:54:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10448) outcome god knows the outcome god still  
[2:54:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10451) uh  
[2:54:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10452) does the test that's a contradiction  
[2:54:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10457) you can make an inductive argument most  
[2:54:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10459) tests are like this therefore it's most  
[2:54:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10462) likely that even in the case of god that  
[2:54:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10464) kind of test will be like that so i just  
[2:54:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10466) have a strong argument against the  
[2:54:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10467) existence of god okay  
[2:54:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10469) it doesn't mean it works bro it just  
[2:54:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10471) means  
[2:54:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10472) can i jump in here  
[2:54:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10474) the thing is is if  
[2:54:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10476) you're saying most right what you're  
[2:54:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10478) saying is most of what we've experienced  
[2:54:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10480) now if it is the case that the test that  
[2:54:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10482) the human being is being put through by  
[2:54:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10485) allah then it's not true that most if if  
[2:54:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10488) this is the exception of the case um or  
[2:54:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10491) even if there are other exceptions  
[2:54:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10493) this one in particular this particular  
[2:54:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10495) exception means that most are not what  
[2:54:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10497) you just said  
[2:54:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10499) because mo like there's more examples of  
[2:55:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10502) you know the amount of human beings that  
[2:55:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10504) have been created in order to go through  
[2:55:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10506) this test so what you're saying is  
[2:55:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10508) completely dependent upon whether or not  
[2:55:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10510) this example that is the human being  
[2:55:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10512) being created and put through a test um  
[2:55:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10515) uh a counter evidence to what you're  
[2:55:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10517) putting forward now with regards to  
[2:55:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10519) evidences within the quran and within  
[2:55:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10522) the sunnah now at no point is the  
[2:55:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10524) proposition put forward that you are not  
[2:55:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10526) a responsible agent the  
[2:55:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10529) the quran never makes this claim on the  
[2:55:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10530) contrary it constantly puts forward the  
[2:55:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10533) the claim that you  
[2:55:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10534) and me and everyone here  
[2:55:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10537) is a responsible agent so here is one  
[2:55:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10539) and uh so this is  
[2:55:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10541) chapter which one is it now chapter 18  
[2:55:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10544) soraka  
[2:55:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10545) uh verse  
[2:55:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10547) 29  
[2:55:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10549) uh yes  
[2:55:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10552) verse 29 and say  
[2:55:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10554) uh  
[2:55:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10556) and say the truth is from your lord then  
[2:55:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10558) whosoever wills lets him believe and  
[2:56:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10561) whosoever wills lets him disbelieve  
[2:56:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10564) verily we have prepared for the zalamun  
[2:56:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10566) the polytheists the wrongdoers a fire  
[2:56:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10568) whose walls will be surrounding them  
[2:56:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10570) and if they ask for help they will be  
[2:56:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10572) granted water like boiling oil  
[2:56:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10575) so you know here whoever wills whoever  
[2:56:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10577) wills if they choose this they get that  
[2:56:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10579) if they choose this they get that and  
[2:56:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10581) then it says here um  
[2:56:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10583) chapter 3 verse 182 that is because of  
[2:56:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10586) what your hands have sent ahead  
[2:56:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10588) what you have done for yourself allah  
[2:56:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10592) does not wrong you but you only wronged  
[2:56:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10594) yourselves um  
[2:56:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10596) the truth is from your lord let anyone  
[2:56:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10598) who wishes believe it and that anyone uh  
[2:56:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10600) sorry that's what i just read indeed we  
[2:56:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10602) have guided him to the way be he  
[2:56:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10604) grateful or ungrateful this is what your  
[2:56:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10606) own hands have sent before and allah is  
[2:56:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10608) not in the least unjust to his servants  
[2:56:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10611) like the president of the pharaoh's clan  
[2:56:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10613) and those who were before them who  
[2:56:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10614) denied the signs of their lord so we  
[2:56:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10616) destroyed them for their sins and we  
[2:56:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10618) drowned pharaoh's clan  
[2:56:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10619) and they were all wrong to us it  
[2:57:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10622) constantly runs in this way you might

[2:57:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10664) upon their hearing and over their vision  
[2:57:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10666) is a veil and for them is a great  
[2:57:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10668) punishment now i have to pull up to

[2:58:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10699) yeah so the problem is matthew brought  
[2:58:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10700) the same verse up  
[2:58:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10702) like he's only been on the show two  
[2:58:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10703) three times and and i  
[2:58:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10706) what i did is i told him just read a few  
[2:58:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10708) verses later and it was a verse that  
[2:58:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10710) specifically gave context and said that  
[2:58:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10712) this blinding and deafening and dumbing  
[2:58:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10714) was a result of you know the agencies  
[2:58:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10718) they react the choices they made and he  
[2:58:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10720) acknowledged that he understood that so  
[2:58:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10722) yeah all readers are coming with the  
[2:58:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10723) same objection i mean it says they think  
[2:58:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10725) they think to deceive allah this is  
[2:58:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10728) starting in verse nine  
[2:58:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10730) they think they deceive allah and those  
[2:58:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10731) who believe but they deceive not accept  
[2:58:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10733) themselves and perceive it not verse 10  
[2:58:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10736) in their hearts is diseased so allah has  
[2:58:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10738) increased their disease and for them is  
[2:59:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10740) a painful punishment because they  
[2:59:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10742) habitually used to lie verse 11 and what  
[2:59:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10745) it is said to them do not cause  
[2:59:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10747) corruption on the earth they say we are  
[2:59:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10749) but reformers verse 12 unquestionably  
[2:59:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10753) unquestionably it is they who are the  
[2:59:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10755) corrupters but they perceive not and  
[2:59:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10757) goes on further to say so that's the  
[2:59:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10758) point it's them who have done it and  
[2:59:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10760) then a law increases their disease yeah  
[2:59:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10763) and just to kind of re really run this  
[2:59:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10765) point home as well is that you'll you'll  
[2:59:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10768) hear them they'll read this and then  
[2:59:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10769) they'll just sort of blanket associated  
[2:59:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10771) to anyone who is referred to as a  
[2:59:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10773) disbeliever but that's not true because  
[2:59:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10774) there is a category of disbelievers who  
[2:59:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10776) can become believers and so therefore  
[2:59:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10778) their hearts  
[2:59:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10779) are not sealed by virtue of the fact  
[2:59:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10781) that they can become believers and that  
[2:59:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10783) they can leave behind what they do and  
[2:59:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10785) allah reaffirms that this kind of  
[2:59:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10787) disbeliever does exist in the quran he  
[2:59:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10790) talks about those who you know um repent  
[2:59:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10793) and that the doors of repentance are  
[2:59:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10794) always open and that you know if they do  
[2:59:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10796) come to allah examples of these within  
[2:59:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10798) the time of the prophet muhammad  
[2:59:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10799) sallallahu alaihi people who began as  
[3:00:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10801) disbelievers began with a certain  
[3:00:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10803) mentality towards the religion  
[3:00:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10805) and eventually their heart changed and  
[3:00:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10807) they inclined towards it now that means  
[3:00:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10810) by necessity that these verses that he's  
[3:00:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10812) pointed out are specifically referring  
[3:00:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10814) to a certain kind of disbeliever who  
[3:00:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10816) persists in their arrogance and  
[3:00:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10819) continues in a particular path which  
[3:00:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10822) they initiated by their own choices for  
[3:00:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10824) which they are responsible as the last  
[3:00:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10826) one i tell her completely you know i've  
[3:00:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10827) already read the verses um you this is  
[3:00:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10830) because of what your own hands have sent  
[3:00:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10831) forward  
[3:00:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10832) this is because of what you have done  
[3:00:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10834) the choices you have made  
[3:00:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10836) you're now dealing with the consequences  
[3:00:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10838) of that and he allows people to dig  
[3:00:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10840) their own holes if you want to do this  
[3:00:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10842) go ahead  
[3:00:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10844) and it's not to say that everyone who  
[3:00:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10846) goes down that particular route can't  
[3:00:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10849) repent the doors of repentance are  
[3:00:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10850) always open  
[3:00:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10851) quite clear but there are some people  
[3:00:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10853) who are just not going to do that and  
[3:00:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10854) they maintain and persist in their  
[3:00:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10856) arrogance and they do until their death  
[3:00:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10857) and then they adopted us i just wanted  
[3:00:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10859) to add as well just really quickly  
[3:01:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10860) obviously he came on initially talking  
[3:01:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10862) about how there's an internal concentric  
[3:01:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10864) contradiction  
[3:01:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10865) and then he gave an example about you  
[3:01:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10867) know the test and god knows the test but  
[3:01:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10869) yet tests  
[3:01:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10871) and are you know defined as those things  
[3:01:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10874) that you don't know the outcome for  
[3:01:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10875) that's the reason why you do the test  
[3:01:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10877) and so  
[3:01:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10878) you know you can see how  
[3:01:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10880) i think with the audience hopefully they  
[3:01:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10882) can see how  
[3:01:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10883) what we demonstrated was that what he  
[3:01:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10886) was arguing was not a logical  
[3:01:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10888) contradiction you heard that because  
[3:01:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10890) when we went over the definition on the  
[3:01:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10893) test i said is that definition necessary  
[3:01:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10897) or you know basically is a logical  
[3:01:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10899) contradiction yeah and he said no  
[3:01:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10902) okay have a nice day and then and then  
[3:01:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10904) abdul rahman explained the soul building  
[3:01:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10907) the idea that you give somebody a test  
[3:01:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10909) that you know  
[3:01:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10911) what's the outcome is going to be but  
[3:01:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10913) you do it for the person so he builds  
[3:01:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10915) his spirituality his mole  
[3:01:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10917) characteristics etc  
[3:01:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10919) so that now completely demolishes the  
[3:02:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10922) argument that says that most if not all  
[3:02:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10924) tests are done for  
[3:02:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10926) unknown outcomes yeah so  
[3:02:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10929) he doesn't really have an evidentialist  
[3:02:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10931) argument nor does he have a logical  
[3:02:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10933) argument in order to demonstrate some  
[3:02:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10935) sort of problem or contradiction in this  
[3:02:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10937) case  
[3:02:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10938) just in response really quick real quick  
[3:02:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10940) just in response to hassan who said that  
[3:02:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10942) a perfect book is so confusing  
[3:02:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10944) bro just because you don't understand  
[3:02:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10946) any something it doesn't mean that it is  
[3:02:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10949) confusing the problem might be from your  
[3:02:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10951) perspective a lot of people don't find  
[3:02:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10953) it confusing and i think it's very clear  
[3:02:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10955) and i think from you know  
[3:02:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10957) the the the discussions we've had with  
[3:02:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10959) many people including yourself who've  
[3:02:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10961) come on the show i think it's been made  
[3:02:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10963) very clear that the problem is is with  
[3:02:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10966) your understanding because what uh the  
[3:02:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10969) book itself says is pretty clear and  
[3:02:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10970) straightforward simple example  
[3:02:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10973) uh some people find calculus really  
[3:02:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10975) confusing  
[3:02:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10976) but you know it doesn't follow from that  
[3:02:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10978) that it isn't coherent and that many  
[3:03:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10980) people do found it completely coherent  
[3:03:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10982) and understand what's going on and yeah  
[3:03:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10985) and matt if he just read a couple more  
[3:03:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10987) verses he would know that it was  
[3:03:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10989) probably one plus one equaling two  
[3:03:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10991) rather than calculus i think we need to  
[3:03:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10993) go to  
[3:03:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10994) um mr delicious  
[3:03:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10997) hold on before i before i bring him on  
[3:03:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=10999) let me take a drink here  
[3:03:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11001) [Laughter]  
[3:03:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11004) mr delicious welcome sir

[3:03:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11009) good i'm just wondering what's what's  
[3:03:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11010) with the name buddy did you come up with  
[3:03:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11012) that yourself or did is that a nickname  
[3:03:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11014) somebody gave you uh that's uh psalms 34  
[3:03:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11017) it says uh taste the lord and see that  
[3:03:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11019) he is good so i i flipped it and i said  
[3:03:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11022) delicious every time i serve the word of  
[3:03:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11024) god is something delicious for the  
[3:03:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11026) people uh to taste  
[3:03:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11028) so uh i have in line with the the the  
[3:03:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11031) uh the topic uh logical uh  
[3:03:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11034) contradictions i'm i wanted to do an  
[3:03:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11037) inter internal critique  
[3:03:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11039) of uh one of the titles or one of the  
[3:04:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11042) uh  
[3:04:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11044) characteristics of your god he says that  
[3:04:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11046) he's omnipresent so i'm wondering if he  
[3:04:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11049) doesn't enter creation how can he be  
[3:04:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11051) omnipresent and if you say he is he does  
[3:04:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11053) enter creation um what is the the  
[3:04:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11056) effects of that uh  
[3:04:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11058) we don't say he's only present where do  
[3:04:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11060) you say that uh  
[3:04:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11062) god is omnipresent in the islamic  
[3:04:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11064) context okay so you don't believe that  
[3:04:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11066) i'm sorry uh  
[3:04:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11067) so you don't believe he's omnipresent  
[3:04:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11069) i'm asking you where does it i don't  
[3:04:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11071) know i i didn't i i thought you guys  
[3:04:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11073) believed that i thought you guys so you  
[3:04:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11075) don't believe he's on me present  
[3:04:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11078) we don't believe that he's  
[3:04:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11080) present in like the space of every  
[3:04:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11083) single  
[3:04:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11084) place in creation yeah we don't believe  
[3:04:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11086) he's permeated through space now okay so  
[3:04:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11088) so i want to make it clear there's no uh  
[3:04:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11090) characteristic or uh  
[3:04:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11093) of omnipresence as it relates to your  
[3:04:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11095) god is what you're saying not in the way  
[3:04:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11097) that you understand it no  
[3:04:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11099) okay so what what does it say  
[3:05:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11101) what do you guys say he is we believe  
[3:05:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11104) that he has knowledge of and he's  
[3:05:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11106) causally active at every point in space  
[3:05:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11108) but we don't believe that he's a a body  
[3:05:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11111) or an object that is literally permeated  
[3:05:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11113) through all of space i don't believe  
[3:05:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11115) that god like there's a piece of god in  
[3:05:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11117) my drink no no problem he's spiritual so  
[3:05:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11120) i figure i figure he wouldn't be  
[3:05:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11122) physical so we're talking about material  
[3:05:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11124) stuff right now okay so how about this  
[3:05:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11125) let's go back to what we finished the  
[3:05:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11127) last time i had to leave um how is your  
[3:05:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11130) god the creator if he doesn't enter  
[3:05:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11131) creation and if he does enter creation  
[3:05:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11133) well you say he doesn't so how do you uh  
[3:05:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11136) connect the cause with the effect uh the  
[3:05:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11139) creator with the the creation  
[3:05:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11143) not sure i understood that one  
[3:05:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11145) uh how do you because  
[3:05:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11147) our position is our god had to uh  
[3:05:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11149) project himself or pierce or puncture  
[3:05:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11152) the veil of eternity and as soon as he  
[3:05:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11154) did that time and space was created  
[3:05:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11156) simultaneously so creation is outside of  
[3:05:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11159) cr of uh the eternal reality so how did  
[3:06:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11162) your god create uh did he create from  
[3:06:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11164) eternity or outside of eternity and if  
[3:06:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11167) he did it from outside of eternity and  
[3:06:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11168) you don't and you claim that he did not  
[3:06:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11170) enter creation so how did he create  
[3:06:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11173) what do you mean by outside of eternity  
[3:06:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11176) uh  
[3:06:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11177) uh isaiah 57 15 says our god inhabits  
[3:06:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11180) eternity so that's a different reality  
[3:06:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11182) from the reality we we live in in  
[3:06:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11183) temporal space right so hold on a second  
[3:06:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11186) are you saying that god needs to enter  
[3:06:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11189) creation in order to create  
[3:06:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11191) no i'm saying if he doesn't then  
[3:06:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11193) creation itself is eternal  
[3:06:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11195) because it comes from eternity  
[3:06:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11198) uh i don't understand that at all yeah i  
[3:06:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11200) don't see how that  
[3:06:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11201) so how did you add that to that  
[3:06:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11203) our god  
[3:06:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11205) maybe you're a god i want to make it  
[3:06:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11206) clear our god inhabits eternity so he  
[3:06:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11208) has to come out outside of eternity  
[3:06:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11210) projects himself in order to create  
[3:06:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11213) yeah i don't know we don't understand  
[3:06:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11214) what that even means you you say he had  
[3:06:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11217) like so we we agree allah has the  
[3:07:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11220) attribute of being eternal yeah  
[3:07:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11223) so where is he right now  
[3:07:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11224) he doesn't have the beginning he doesn't  
[3:07:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11226) have an end that's what any meaning is  
[3:07:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11228) eternal okay so so the question is now  
[3:07:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11232) let's just stay on point so you said he  
[3:07:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11235) has to  
[3:07:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11236) leave eternity  
[3:07:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11239) i didn't say i didn't i didn't say that  
[3:07:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11240) i didn't say that uh  
[3:07:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11242) did you rephrase no let me rephrase my  
[3:07:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11244) words i said he inhabits eternity and he  
[3:07:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11247) projected himself outside of eternity  
[3:07:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11249) the light remember the son of god the  
[3:07:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11251) light the sun analogy so he projects  
[3:07:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11253) himself from eternity he punctures the  
[3:07:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11255) devil of eternity that separates  
[3:07:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11256) eternity from temple space and he  
[3:07:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11258) projects himself and wherever the light  
[3:07:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11260) is he created so simultaneously as that  
[3:07:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11262) light was projecting from eternity time  
[3:07:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11265) and space was created and all everything  
[3:07:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11267) that's in it so my question to you is  
[3:07:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11269) first of all does your god inhabit  
[3:07:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11271) eternity that's the person is is  
[3:07:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11273) eternity a space  
[3:07:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11275) no it's not a space no no it's not it's  
[3:07:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11277) not a space  
[3:07:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11279) what do you mean by he's inhabiting  
[3:08:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11280) eternity oh so you're saying that  
[3:08:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11282) because he inhabits eternity it has to  
[3:08:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11284) be spatial no no but you're asking we're  
[3:08:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11286) asking you what you're saying  
[3:08:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11289) you're saying that and then your  
[3:08:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11290) question that comes after it seems to  
[3:08:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11293) assume that and that's why we're asking  
[3:08:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11294) no no no no  
[3:08:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11297) we've got another one you've made the  
[3:08:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11308) because he inhabits eternity that it has  
[3:08:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11310) to be spacious  
[3:08:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11311) no no your  
[3:08:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11312) we're asking you i understand yeah we're  
[3:08:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11315) not we're not pre-supported we're asking  
[3:08:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11316) you for clarification so so make it  
[3:08:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11319) clear he inhabits eternity so if he  
[3:08:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11321) inhabits eternity it cannot be temple  
[3:08:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11323) space so it means something else a  
[3:08:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11325) difference  
[3:08:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11327) okay let me let me let me just tell you  
[3:08:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11328) what the islam  
[3:08:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11329) i thought okay let me tell you what the  
[3:08:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11331) islamic view the islamic view is allah  
[3:08:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11334) exists without beginning without end  
[3:08:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11336) he's eternal in that sense he chooses to  
[3:08:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11339) create creation begins at a particular  
[3:09:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11341) time  
[3:09:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11342) simple okay  
[3:09:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11343) okay so quick question and then uh is  
[3:09:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11345) going to lead me to because i need to  
[3:09:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11346) understand this  
[3:09:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11348) are you saying your guide is nowhere is  
[3:09:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11350) he somewhere  
[3:09:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11352) because our god is something we just  
[3:09:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11353) exactly we just went back to this point  
[3:09:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11356) when you when you were talking about  
[3:09:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11358) inhabiting eternity and then breaking  
[3:09:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11360) through it with the light and and then  
[3:09:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11362) we said well what is eternity and you're  
[3:09:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11364) saying there is no space location so  
[3:09:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11366) you're saying god he breaks through this  
[3:09:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11369) whatever inhabiting eternity is and now  
[3:09:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11371) he exists in a particular place so where  
[3:09:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11373) does he exist  
[3:09:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11375) no no i didn't say he exists i'm saying  
[3:09:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11376) that you said you you said that he  
[3:09:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11378) occupies space he has a place he uh i  
[3:09:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11381) said he inhabits eternity so when i'm  
[3:09:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11384) saying he inhabits eternity when the  
[3:09:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11386) fact that i see eternity means a  
[3:09:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11388) different reality so you cannot conflate  
[3:09:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11390) that with uh right we're talking about  
[3:09:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11392) now after eternity where is he  
[3:09:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11395) when he projects himself from eternity  
[3:09:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11397) he's engaged in sustaining all of  
[3:09:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11399) creation which i think your god is also  
[3:10:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11401) sustaining creation i don't know maybe  
[3:10:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11402) this is sustaining how is he doing that  
[3:10:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11405) how is he doing it this power  
[3:10:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11408) does its power enter creation  
[3:10:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11411) what do you mean this is power enter  
[3:10:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11412) creation to sustain that the cause is in  
[3:10:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11415) eternity the effect is in temple space  
[3:10:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11418) if your power is not inter entering time  
[3:10:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11421) and space then you're not sustaining it  
[3:10:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11423) how does he sustain  
[3:10:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11425) is not a thing it's not like an object  
[3:10:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11427) that enters somewhere  
[3:10:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11429) it's an effect right it's it's an effect  
[3:10:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11431) so the effect is it tangible it's not  
[3:10:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11435) the power is the cause the effect is the  
[3:10:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11437) fact that it's still existing  
[3:10:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11440) okay does it have any tangible effects  
[3:10:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11443) the power that you're talking about from  
[3:10:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11444) god does it have any tangible effect on  
[3:10:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11447) temporal space yeah yeah every moment  
[3:10:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11450) okay so explain to me  
[3:10:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11452) how is that not saying that your god  
[3:10:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11454) entertain and temple space because god  
[3:10:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11456) is not identical to power  
[3:10:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11458) okay so okay no problem we'll go with  
[3:11:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11460) that that's power  
[3:11:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11462) we could go there power power is an  
[3:11:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11464) attribute no problem we can go there so  
[3:11:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11466) explain to me now how does that power  
[3:11:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11468) not overwhelm or destroy temple space  
[3:11:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11471) without the containment the truth is he  
[3:11:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11473) chooses not to he could destroy it in  
[3:11:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11475) one moment if you wanted to so you're  
[3:11:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11477) saying he could not be powerful  
[3:11:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11479) i said that he could destroy everything  
[3:11:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11481) that exists in one moment if you wanted  
[3:11:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11484) to i know but the power is there you  
[3:11:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11485) said you said it's not uh yeah if he  
[3:11:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11487) removes his power if you want to talk  
[3:11:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11489) about it in that language if he removes  
[3:11:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11491) his power as you're saying if he chooses  
[3:11:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11493) not to sustain everything that exists  
[3:11:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11495) everything would crumble i understand  
[3:11:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11497) that part that's not the angle i'm going  
[3:11:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11499) i'm going with the power itself why is  
[3:11:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11501) it yeah the power itself is not a thing  
[3:11:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11503) that is inhabiting creation  
[3:11:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11506) so so it has no tangible effect with  
[3:11:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11508) temp temple does not have a spatial  
[3:11:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11512) location that's the point it's not a  
[3:11:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11513) thing that occupies space  
[3:11:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11516) no no no  
[3:11:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11517) the point i'm establishing here you're  
[3:11:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11519) saying that your god is powerful  
[3:12:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11522) his substance is power right does that  
[3:12:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11525) power projects itself  
[3:12:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11527) into temporal space in order to  
[3:12:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11529) substantiate it doesn't no it doesn't no  
[3:12:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11531) it doesn't so it doesn't occupy my space  
[3:12:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11533) it doesn't matter  
[3:12:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11534) so united power is not a thing that  
[3:12:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11536) occupies space that's what you're  
[3:12:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11538) assuming that it is it's not  
[3:12:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11540) so what so so how is it sustaining the  
[3:12:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11542) creation  
[3:12:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11544) i feel like we're spinning in circles  
[3:12:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11550) so you said your god so you're god  
[3:12:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11552) assuming from the problem you're putting  
[3:12:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11554) forward that your god basically needs to  
[3:12:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11557) his power needs to manifest in creation  
[3:12:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11560) in order for him to create right but  
[3:12:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11562) before he created there there wasn't  
[3:12:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11565) space for his power to enter so how was  
[3:12:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11568) the space created in order for his power  
[3:12:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11570) to enter the space is what i wanted good  
[3:12:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11572) question good question and i see how uh  
[3:12:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11574) uh yusuf is smiling is  
[3:12:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11577) watch out his face changes when i  
[3:12:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11578) respond because as soon as he punctured  
[3:13:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11581) the action is from eternity  
[3:13:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11586) sorry sorry sorry let him speak let him  
[3:13:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11588) answer yeah there is no puncturing  
[3:13:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11590) wait wait no no no  
[3:13:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11592) according to our model i'm doing that  
[3:13:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11593) internally you're not you're not no you  
[3:13:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11595) said according to our model and then  
[3:13:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11597) you're saying you're doing an internal  
[3:13:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11598) critique yes  
[3:13:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11603) i know  
[3:13:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11604) yeah but yeah i'm doing an internal  
[3:13:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11606) critique i'm doing a christian model i'm  
[3:13:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11608) doing the question okay so just answer  
[3:13:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11610) the question answer the question okay so  
[3:13:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11611) let me do it right okay so  
[3:13:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11614) so the action is from eternity the  
[3:13:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11616) puncturing of the veil as soon as the  
[3:13:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11618) puncture on the veil took place that  
[3:13:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11620) separates eternity from temporal space  
[3:13:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11621) there was no temporal space i understand  
[3:13:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11623) that as soon as he punctured the veil  
[3:13:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11626) uh simultaneously time his space was  
[3:13:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11628) created and as he's projecting his life  
[3:13:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11630) from uh uh eternity he's created at the  
[3:13:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11633) same time so imagine a life  
[3:13:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11638) conduction and creation at the same time  
[3:14:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11640) i understand but even even if they're at  
[3:14:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11642) the same time if creation isn't eternal  
[3:14:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11645) then you would need space  
[3:14:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11647) that can like you know encompass his  
[3:14:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11650) power so that his power can go into it  
[3:14:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11652) if there's no space for his power to it  
[3:14:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11653) doesn't understand then no no you didn't  
[3:14:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11656) he didn't  
[3:14:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11657) look at the country  
[3:14:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11661) and as soon as he punctured it there was  
[3:14:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11664) nothing right there was only the  
[3:14:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11665) puncturing as soon as that puncture  
[3:14:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11667) listen listen no because this is the bit  
[3:14:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11669) this is the okay this is why it's not an  
[3:14:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11671) internal critique anymore listen listen  
[3:14:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11674) no let me let me say this yeah but  
[3:14:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11677) in order to puncture  
[3:14:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11679) that thing has to exist already to be  
[3:14:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11681) punctured yes  
[3:14:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11684) the veil already  
[3:14:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11687) here here here's a logical argument  
[3:14:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11689) terry in order for your god to create  
[3:14:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11692) one second his power needs to enter  
[3:14:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11694) creation creation is not eternal  
[3:14:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11696) creation is not eternal it has a  
[3:14:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11698) beginning therefore your god couldn't  
[3:15:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11700) have created because there was nowhere  
[3:15:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11702) for his power to enter so that's that's  
[3:15:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11705) basically that's basically what i'm  
[3:15:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11706) saying unless you're saying unless  
[3:15:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11707) you're saying that creation is  
[3:15:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11709) co-eternal with your god and his  
[3:15:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11711) existing creation then you can't really  
[3:15:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11714) solve this problem because there what  
[3:15:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11716) yusuf just said is because you're saying  
[3:15:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11718) that there's something that's punctured  
[3:15:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11720) and then space is created but then how  
[3:15:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11722) is that  
[3:15:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11723) you see you see you're not paying  
[3:15:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11724) attention  
[3:15:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11726) attention  
[3:15:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11727) one more time wait one second  
[3:15:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11730) no problem no problem  
[3:15:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11732) you cannot you cannot say you responded  
[3:15:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11733) to me when you're speaking over me  
[3:15:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11734) because you didn't respond go ahead  
[3:15:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11736) speak  
[3:15:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11737) one more time  
[3:15:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11738) he inhabits eternity so this the veiling  
[3:15:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11741) is eternal with him he punctures that  
[3:15:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11744) veil  
[3:15:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11745) as soon as that veil is  
[3:15:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11750) as soon as he punctures it  
[3:15:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11752) time and space is created as the light  
[3:15:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11754) is projected from that veil  
[3:15:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11756) so  
[3:15:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11758) listen listen listen  
[3:16:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11761) here's the hole okay yeah he enters  
[3:16:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11763) there's nothing right and then the light  
[3:16:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11765) comes let the light be that's the light  
[3:16:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11767) yeah yeah yeah okay  
[3:16:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11769) so you're using it  
[3:16:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11774) so so the veil he punctures the veil as  
[3:16:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11776) soon as he punches the belt time and  
[3:16:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11778) space and the light is projecting right  
[3:16:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11780) so picture the light is here right now  
[3:16:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11782) it's projecting time and space is  
[3:16:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11783) creating creating creating creating  
[3:16:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11785) simultaneously as the light is  
[3:16:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11787) projecting protecting where  
[3:16:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11793) as soon as he's projecting time his  
[3:16:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11795) place is being created simultaneously  
[3:16:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11797) okay okay is the veil  
[3:16:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11799) okay terry let's make this simple is the  
[3:16:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11801) veil a part of him  
[3:16:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11804) no it's part of the the the what he  
[3:16:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11806) inhabits the value is the eternity  
[3:16:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11811) well you said it's a place where he  
[3:16:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11813) inhabits but before you said it wasn't a  
[3:16:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11814) place  
[3:16:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11815) when i say a place okay i'm sorry he  
[3:16:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11818) inhabits eternity if you don't want the  
[3:16:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11819) workplace  
[3:17:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11821) is it a part of him or is it part of  
[3:17:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11822) christ  
[3:17:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11824) he inhabits that place or he inhabits  
[3:17:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11827) eternity it's not part of him  
[3:17:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11829) it's a place it's a place then okay but  
[3:17:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11831) you turn a place  
[3:17:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11832) okay and that's my point and before you  
[3:17:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11834) said it wasn't the place so now you came  
[3:17:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11836) on here trying to do an internal  
[3:17:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11838) critique to show a contradiction and you  
[3:17:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11839) proved your own possession contradictory  
[3:17:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11842) this is so funny  
[3:17:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11843) wait wait wait wait wait what come  
[3:17:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11858) and try to see how you respond no you're  
[3:17:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11860) insane okay one second i said the place  
[3:17:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11864) is an eternal place so it's not temple  
[3:17:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11866) yeah  
[3:17:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11867) no no no but listen it's i said from the  
[3:17:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11869) beginning it's eternal so it's not  
[3:17:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11871) temple but it's still placement  
[3:17:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11874) you cannot conflate it with temporal  
[3:17:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11875) space so whatever point you're trying to  
[3:17:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11877) establish is desperate on your part  
[3:18:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11880) it's different  
[3:18:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11881) to reality  
[3:18:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11885) second point second point is  
[3:18:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11899) aren't you going to heaven with allah  
[3:18:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11901) you're in your own position if you think  
[3:18:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11903) that god is powerful one second one  
[3:18:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11905) second if you think that god's power  
[3:18:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11907) needs to enter creation in order for him  
[3:18:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11908) to create but you also think he existed  
[3:18:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11910) eternally alone and there was no place  
[3:18:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11912) for his power to go then literally he  
[3:18:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11914) cannot create i mean what does that mean  
[3:18:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11916) there's nothing simultaneous that can  
[3:18:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11918) happen because there's no place for his  
[3:18:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11920) light or power to go there's no place  
[3:18:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11922) there's you can't say any simultaneously  
[3:18:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11925) simultaneously  
[3:18:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11926) then i say simultaneously simultaneously  
[3:18:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11929) where's the what's going and there's no  
[3:18:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11930) place listen  
[3:18:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11932) you're probably i know there's no place  
[3:18:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11933) i know there's no place yeah as the  
[3:18:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11935) light has a creating force so as the  
[3:18:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11938) light is created yeah  
[3:19:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11943) so so if you know that why are you  
[3:19:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11945) making a ridiculous thing because that's  
[3:19:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11947) the point that's our position the point  
[3:19:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11949) is i'm not i'm not arguing  
[3:19:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11952) i'm saying where does it come from  
[3:19:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11954) where does it come from it's not x  
[3:19:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11956) needle saying  
[3:19:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11965) he was in a place  
[3:19:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11967) so yeah that is nowhere  
[3:19:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11968) you just said that he wasn't in a place  
[3:19:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11970) and now you're saying that he wasn't he  
[3:19:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11972) isn't the brother has a place where's  
[3:19:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11974) your guy yeah but he said before from  
[3:19:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11976) eternity pass he didn't that place and  
[3:19:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11977) now you're saying that he does you  
[3:19:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11978) contradicted yourself you got caught out  
[3:19:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11981) brother  
[3:19:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11982) you're all friends  
[3:19:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11983) you're always you're like  
[3:19:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11988) listen delicious no problem delicious  
[3:19:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11990) that is delicious delicious i'm telling  
[3:19:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11992) you i'm not i'm not tasting what you're  
[3:19:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11995) serving brother you're not tasting what  
[3:19:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11996) you're doing this represented my  
[3:19:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=11997) argument no i don't  
[3:20:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12007) yeah we're not i'm not tasting what  
[3:20:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12008) you're serving buddy sorry to tell you  
[3:20:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12011) not interested i know that christians  
[3:20:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12013) believe that they can drink and eat  
[3:20:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12014) their god but i'm not tasting it sorry  
[3:20:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12019) see even this notion of veil like he  
[3:20:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12021) says that well i wanted to bring that in  
[3:20:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12023) because i thought he was gonna say yeah  
[3:20:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12024) it is a part of god and i was gonna show  
[3:20:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12026) well now there's a hole in the veil and  
[3:20:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12029) that hasn't been plugged up so now god  
[3:20:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12031) is like have a has a hole in him but he  
[3:20:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12034) didn't even want to say that because now  
[3:20:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12036) he said it's it is a place but before it  
[3:20:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12038) wasn't a place  
[3:20:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12041) even the word veil presupposes that  
[3:20:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12044) there's a distinction between  
[3:20:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12045) that which is vague there's something on  
[3:20:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12048) the other side  
[3:20:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12049) yeah that which is being veiled from  
[3:20:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12051) yeah so like he's not silly and then  
[3:20:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12054) he's saying it's being punctured so  
[3:20:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12056) you've got this thing that isn't god  
[3:20:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12058) that surrounds god that hides it from  
[3:21:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12060) nothing it's a vision it's not like  
[3:21:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12063) veiling at all there's no power the  
[3:21:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12065) power goes towards nothing i i mean what  
[3:21:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12068) it is  
[3:21:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12069) it's like he's thinking of nothing as  
[3:21:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12071) like you know just like a vacuum let's  
[3:21:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12073) go to cool kid we got the last person  
[3:21:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12075) here yeah who could better be a cool kid  
[3:21:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12078) this would be a nice ending if cool kid  
[3:21:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12080) is  
[3:21:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12081) okay  
[3:21:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12097) you and and your actions  
[3:21:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12099) so if creating if creating your actions  
[3:21:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12101) entails determining them  
[3:21:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12103) then to say we have free will it would  
[3:21:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12105) be a contradiction wouldn't it be  
[3:21:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12109) so there's a number of ways though well  
[3:21:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12110) dude hold  
[3:21:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12111) do you believe that we have free will  
[3:21:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12113) yes i do  
[3:21:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12115) okay so how do you answer that  
[3:21:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12119) um  
[3:22:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12121) or you just don't  
[3:22:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12124) know i would just say  
[3:22:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12127) uh yeah i don't know actually  
[3:22:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12130) okay yeah  
[3:22:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12131) go ahead sharif  
[3:22:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12133) yes there's a number of uh tafsirs that  
[3:22:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12136) you can look at in terms of that  
[3:22:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12138) particular version one of the  
[3:22:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12140) explanations is uh allah created your  
[3:22:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12143) ability to perform the action so for  
[3:22:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12145) example let's take your hand your hand  
[3:22:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12146) was created that could work  
[3:22:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12148) and it was created with the capacity  
[3:22:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12150) that could steal  
[3:22:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12151) so if you make a choice between the two  
[3:22:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12153) you're not choosing outside of the  
[3:22:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12155) creation of allah because allah created  
[3:22:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12158) you with that capacity and that  
[3:22:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12160) capability so allah created you and your  
[3:22:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12163) handiwork in that context yeah but also  
[3:22:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12165) i think from from my memory that  
[3:22:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12167) particular verse is actually specific to  
[3:22:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12169) a particular incident  
[3:22:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12172) uh it's not to be taken generally i'd  
[3:22:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12174) have to check the tafseer of that verse  
[3:22:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12175) though  
[3:22:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12177) yeah i don't i think it's being misused  
[3:22:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12179) if you look at in the context of that  
[3:23:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12181) verse  
[3:23:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12183) it's talking about the idols that were  
[3:23:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12186) um abraham was dealing with so  
[3:23:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12188) if you go back starting um  
[3:23:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12192) at verse 83 and indeed among his kind  
[3:23:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12195) was abraham when he came to his lord  
[3:23:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12197) with a sound heart and when he said to  
[3:23:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12199) his father and his people what do you  
[3:23:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12201) worship  
[3:23:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12202) is it falsehood as god's other than a  
[3:23:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12205) law you desire  
[3:23:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12206) then what it then what is your thought  
[3:23:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12208) about the lord of the worlds and he  
[3:23:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12210) casted look at the stars and said indeed  
[3:23:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12212) i am i'm about to be ill  
[3:23:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12214) so they turned away from him departing  
[3:23:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12217) then he turned to their gods  
[3:23:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12220) speaking about the idols and said do you  
[3:23:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12222) not eat what is wrong with you that you  
[3:23:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12225) do not speak and he turned upon them  
[3:23:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12228) a blow with his right hand  
[3:23:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12230) then they the people came toward him  
[3:23:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12232) hastening he said do you worship that  
[3:23:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12236) which you yourselves carve  
[3:23:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12238) and the very next verse is  
[3:24:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12241) while allah created you and that which  
[3:24:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12244) you make  
[3:24:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12245) so it's referring to the the idols in  
[3:24:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12248) the previous verse and saying  
[3:24:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12250) why are you worshiping  
[3:24:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12252) the creation which allah has created  
[3:24:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12255) when he created you  
[3:24:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12256) and the idols which you're making which  
[3:24:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12258) you're carving  
[3:24:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12260) that's what it's referring to  
[3:24:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12263) okay yeah i guess  
[3:24:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12265) because of the translation that i have  
[3:24:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12266) here it says do  
[3:24:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12268) uh yeah i understand  
[3:24:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12269) but if you if you if you literally read  
[3:24:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12271) it in context and look at the previous  
[3:24:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12273) verse i think it's quite clear  
[3:24:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12276) okay okay that but even even on the  
[3:24:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12279) other reading i mean i think yeah i  
[3:24:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12280) think jake is right clearly on that with  
[3:24:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12282) that context but even on the other  
[3:24:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12283) reading i mean it doesn't necessitate  
[3:24:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12285) that you know he  
[3:24:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12287) chooses the act for us so it's the  
[3:24:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12289) freely freely chosen act that he  
[3:24:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12292) actualizes basically so  
[3:24:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12294) god knows what our free choice will be  
[3:24:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12297) and he just actualizes that  
[3:24:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12299) if if you're gonna take that uh reading  
[3:25:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12301) of it but then i think the context that  
[3:25:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12302) jake provided is just that that's  
[3:25:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12304) sufficient really  
[3:25:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12306) yeah i mean it it says  
[3:25:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12308) which is what you make or what you do  
[3:25:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12311) quite literally but again in the context  
[3:25:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12315) that can very easily be referring to the  
[3:25:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12317) previous verse when it's talking about  
[3:25:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12319) it's created you and uh what you da  
[3:25:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12322) maluna i mean what you make so i don't  
[3:25:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12325) see how  
[3:25:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12326) uh there would be any problem there  
[3:25:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12329) okay thank you i i think i just got  
[3:25:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12332) confused uh yeah but yeah thanks  
[3:25:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12334) it's interesting cool kid just uh just  
[3:25:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12336) as a wider point the jabria who denied  
[3:25:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12340) uh free will and they used to use some  
[3:25:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12343) of these verses to try to justify that  
[3:25:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12345) now the problem is is that when you have  
[3:25:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12348) certain metaphysical commitments  
[3:25:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12351) uh in terms of particular persuasions  
[3:25:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12353) and beliefs and then you go to the quran  
[3:25:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12356) you start quote mining the quran  
[3:25:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12359) in order to try to prove your particular  
[3:26:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12360) position your theological position  
[3:26:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12363) rather than allowing the quran to inform  
[3:26:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12365) your theological position so you try to  
[3:26:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12368) justify it from the quran  
[3:26:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12370) because you've already got it in your  
[3:26:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12372) head what your  
[3:26:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12373) particular position is  
[3:26:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12376) so yeah i've come across that particular  
[3:26:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12378) verse and it's been a while since i  
[3:26:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12380) checked the particular tips here of that  
[3:26:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12382) verse  
[3:26:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12383) uh but it doesn't i don't mean uh it's  
[3:26:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12385) not understood in the context that  
[3:26:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12387) therefore allah  
[3:26:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12389) causes you to uh do the action and you  
[3:26:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12393) don't have any free wills i don't think  
[3:26:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12395) it's ever been understood that uh abdul  
[3:26:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12397) rahman gave one possible explanation  
[3:26:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12399) which is like an ashley explanation and  
[3:26:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12402) jake talked about the context of the the  
[3:26:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12404) verse  
[3:26:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12405) uh the verses as well within that  
[3:26:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12407) context as well  
[3:26:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12409) all right thank you yeah thank you  
[3:26:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12411) bye-bye  
[3:26:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12416) all right so that's the  
[3:26:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12418) end of the show  
[3:26:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12419) three and a half hours in  
[3:27:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12421) this whole uh try to keep it short  
[3:27:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12423) around the two hour mark just went  
[3:27:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12424) completely out the window all night  
[3:27:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12427) i don't know  
[3:27:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12428) i think you know what i liked i like  
[3:27:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12430) that matthew came on and i think he i  
[3:27:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12433) think he learned something you know no  
[3:27:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12436) i'm not trying to be like you know  
[3:27:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12438) critical of him but i think he did learn  
[3:27:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12440) something about what a  
[3:27:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12441) logical contradiction is an internal  
[3:27:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12444) critique  
[3:27:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12445) and then more of an evidentialist  
[3:27:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12447) argument uh and the difference between  
[3:27:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12449) them so i think that's a good thing  
[3:27:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12452) if we can get through to one person  
[3:27:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12454) isn't it  
[3:27:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12454) it's always good  
[3:27:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12458) inshallah  
[3:27:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12459) nobody else seems so  
[3:27:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12467) so did we lose jake if the quran is so  
[3:27:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12470) controversial has been for 1400 years  
[3:27:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12473) it does not seem very miraculous no i  
[3:27:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12476) don't think the issue is that the  
[3:27:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12477) controversy of the quran like i said is  
[3:28:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12480) that certain uh  
[3:28:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12483) theological groupings like the year like  
[3:28:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12485) the mata  
[3:28:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12487) they came to their theological positions  
[3:28:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12489) because of certain external influences  
[3:28:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12493) in philosophy  
[3:28:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12494) mainly from the greek positions and so  
[3:28:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12497) from  
[3:28:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12498) they've already presupposed certain  
[3:28:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12500) things  
[3:28:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12501) without being informed by islam and then  
[3:28:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12504) they retrospectively try to read the  
[3:28:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12506) quran as a way to justify you can  
[3:28:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12508) literally do that with any book it  
[3:28:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12510) doesn't require you know i could take  
[3:28:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12512) data points  
[3:28:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12514) for covid 19 vaccines and prove that  
[3:28:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12517) it's effective and also try to  
[3:28:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12519) demonstrate that it's ineffective as  
[3:28:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12520) well if i want to quote mine some of the  
[3:28:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12523) data points i could say yeah covid19  
[3:28:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12525) causes more deaths  
[3:28:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12526) so i believe the vaccine causes more  
[3:28:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12528) death so you know it's literally  
[3:28:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12530) anything but rather what you try to do  
[3:28:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12532) is you try to remove as many of your  
[3:28:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12534) metaphysical commitments your  
[3:28:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12536) presuppositions and try to read and  
[3:28:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12538) understand the quran and let that inform  
[3:29:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12541) you regardless of your theology  
[3:29:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12543) not the other way around when you do  
[3:29:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12545) that there are no issues with regards to  
[3:29:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12547) what the islamic beliefs are and  
[3:29:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12548) certainly the fundamental concepts of  
[3:29:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12550) islam  
[3:29:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12551) you know are clear-cut they are  
[3:29:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12554) firmly established  
[3:29:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12556) i don't know if uh abdul wants to say  
[3:29:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12558) anything or sorry i was just going to  
[3:29:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12560) add that controversy doesn't equate to  
[3:29:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12562) falsehood either it's like that  
[3:29:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12565) you could speak to some people in  
[3:29:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12566) certain parts of the world  
[3:29:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12568) and uh  
[3:29:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12570) they might hold this notion that the  
[3:29:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12573) you know there's some absurd like um i  
[3:29:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12575) don't know  
[3:29:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12576) any any of the absurd claims that that  
[3:29:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12579) people deny things that uh  
[3:29:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12582) like  
[3:29:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12583) yeah  
[3:29:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12584) or whatever yeah  
[3:29:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12586) yeah yeah we didn't go to the moon we  
[3:29:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12588) didn't do this we didn't do that yeah  
[3:29:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12590) these things they have answers they have  
[3:29:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12592) a truth value yourself now that you said  
[3:29:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12594) we haven't gone to the moon  
[3:29:57](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12597) as a conspiracy we're going to get loads  
[3:29:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12599) of comments in the section saying  
[3:30:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12601) brother don't you know we didn't go to  
[3:30:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12603) the moon it's all fake  
[3:30:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12606) i i'd be honest  
[3:30:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12607) personally i don't incline to either one  
[3:30:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12610) i'm just pointing it out  
[3:30:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12612) so  
[3:30:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12614) i even understand some of the points  
[3:30:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12616) they make uh although i wouldn't say  
[3:30:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12618) that i know we didn't go to the moon  
[3:30:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12620) um that's a whole other topic but i  
[3:30:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12622) don't know what i think it might be fun  
[3:30:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12627) i don't know about pink ellie do an  
[3:30:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12628) episode on  
[3:30:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12637) metaphysically impossible  
[3:30:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12639) yeah  
[3:30:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12640) i mean on that i think i'd rather  
[3:30:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12642) comment on that than the whole um  
[3:30:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12644) controversy thing because to be honest  
[3:30:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12646) i've heard enough today but uh but the  
[3:30:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12649) thing about  
[3:30:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12650) logical possibilities and i think this  
[3:30:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12652) is good because it's related directly to  
[3:30:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12654) the topic of the stream is that a lot of  
[3:30:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12656) people um take logical possibilities way  
[3:30:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12659) too seriously  
[3:31:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12661) like i i know  
[3:31:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12662) a guy a muslim who takes the idea that  
[3:31:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12664) you know it is possible that we're in a  
[3:31:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12667) simulation  
[3:31:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12668) very very seriously in the sense that he  
[3:31:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12670) literally can't get rid of the question  
[3:31:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12671) i mean no matter how  
[3:31:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12673) satisfying the answers may seem to be  
[3:31:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12675) it's just that's it but what if uh and  
[3:31:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12678) and that's that's that's a problem  
[3:31:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12680) because people assume that just because  
[3:31:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12681) something is  
[3:31:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12682) possible  
[3:31:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12684) then maybe they should like lose sleep  
[3:31:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12686) over it or something but  
[3:31:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12688) uh  
[3:31:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12689) possibility  
[3:31:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12690) has nothing to do with plausibility i  
[3:31:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12692) mean something needs to be possible in  
[3:31:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12693) order as a minimum criteria as jake  
[3:31:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12696) mentioned in order for it to you know  
[3:31:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12699) uh have the capacity to be true or to be  
[3:31:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12701) eligible for for you know that kind of  
[3:31:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12704) assessment  
[3:31:45](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12705) but that's just a minimum requirement  
[3:31:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12707) and i think what we do when we're when  
[3:31:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12710) we're when we're critiquing things when  
[3:31:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12712) we're doing internal critiques of  
[3:31:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12713) certain positions or world views is that  
[3:31:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12716) we're trying to show that this position  
[3:31:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12718) is not possible right now if it were  
[3:32:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12720) shown that it is possible that doesn't  
[3:32:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12722) make it true i mean it doesn't solve the  
[3:32:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12724) problem and that's it suddenly you know  
[3:32:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12726) it becomes true so the idea of an  
[3:32:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12728) internal critique is like truth by  
[3:32:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12730) contradiction is the easiest way to show  
[3:32:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12733) that something is false right so i mean  
[3:32:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12735) if you believe in  
[3:32:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12737) a and not a or something that entails it  
[3:32:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12740) then that's the the easiest way to show  
[3:32:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12742) that your belief is false is to  
[3:32:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12744) demonstrate that contradiction  
[3:32:26](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12746) and and uh again that's a minimum bar  
[3:32:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12749) for your beliefs to be coherent and from  
[3:32:32](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12752) there  
[3:32:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12753) there's some more work to be done to to  
[3:32:35](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12755) show whether it's uh you know to show  
[3:32:37](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12757) that it's your position is plausible  
[3:32:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12759) it's reasonable and it's uh actually a  
[3:32:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12761) justified true belief  
[3:32:43](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12763) yeah  
[3:32:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12764) so it's kind of hinges on this epistemic  
[3:32:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12766) way it's like just  
[3:32:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12768) right  
[3:32:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12769) the the the age of the universe is a  
[3:32:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12771) good goal to one um the universe was  
[3:32:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12773) created 14 billion years ago  
[3:32:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12776) 13.78 billion years ago yeah all right  
[3:32:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12779) sorry  
[3:33:01](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12781) oh it was uh created five minutes ago  
[3:33:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12784) you know the whole well last thursday  
[3:33:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12786) you know last thursday ism the whole  
[3:33:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12788) universe was great last thursday with  
[3:33:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12789) everything  
[3:33:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12790) in it including all historical evidences  
[3:33:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12793) and all memories etc now both are  
[3:33:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12795) possible or the pink elephant all the  
[3:33:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12798) pink dolphins yeah yeah  
[3:33:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12800) um they're possible but the question is  
[3:33:22](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12802) is like which one has more epistemic  
[3:33:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12805) weight um you know because we could do  
[3:33:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12807) it for every possible minute is possible  
[3:33:30](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12810) it could have been done one minute or  
[3:33:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12811) two minutes ago you could do it you know  
[3:33:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12813) in two seconds and then you have this  
[3:33:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12814) sort of infinite number  
[3:33:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12816) of um times at which the universe could  
[3:33:39](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12819) have possibly have begun but then the  
[3:33:41](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12821) question isn't just like whether or not  
[3:33:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12822) it's possible it's like what reasons do  
[3:33:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12824) we have to believe this possibility over  
[3:33:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12826) that one and just pointing out that five  
[3:33:48](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12828) minutes ago is possible does not make it  
[3:33:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12832) epistemically equal in terms of its  
[3:33:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12834) weight to the possibility that it was  
[3:33:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12836) created 14 or 13.8  
[3:33:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12839) whatever billion years ago um you know  
[3:34:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12842) there is evidence that leads you into  
[3:34:04](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12844) one direction rather than the other and  
[3:34:06](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12846) so for that reason you don't have to  
[3:34:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12848) just jump on this  
[3:34:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12849) because someone's brought it up as a  
[3:34:11](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12851) possibility um it's like well okay  
[3:34:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12854) you've it's possible that the universe  
[3:34:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12856) was created in a simulation and we lived  
[3:34:17](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12857) in some sort of matrix but like what  
[3:34:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12860) evidence do you have  
[3:34:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12861) to suggest that one in particular like  
[3:34:24](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12864) what reasons are there for that simply  
[3:34:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12867) other than just pointing out that it's a  
[3:34:29](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12869) possibility  
[3:34:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12871) you need more than just pointing out it  
[3:34:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12873) as a possibility you need more reasons  
[3:34:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12876) and you know people they they don't  
[3:34:38](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12878) understand this and they just sort of  
[3:34:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12880) um they flatten the the playing field  
[3:34:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12884) and just putting forward things as  
[3:34:47](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12887) possibilities they then assume  
[3:34:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12889) that that means that you know  
[3:34:50](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12890) they become equal and that it's just as  
[3:34:52](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12892) possible as that and it's like no no  
[3:34:54](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12894) like like  
[3:34:56](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12896) it's not just about whether or not  
[3:34:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12898) you've shown it's possible it's about  
[3:34:59](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12899) like can you justify that as well  
[3:35:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12903) and  
[3:35:03](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12903) yeah  
[3:35:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12905) cool i think uh i think we should end it  
[3:35:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12908) there i think  
[3:35:09](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12909) to go  
[3:35:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12910) uh but i hope uh  
[3:35:12](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12912) i hope people  
[3:35:14](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12914) is it's a it's a difficult topic maybe  
[3:35:16](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12916) for some people to understand  
[3:35:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12918) and i'm looking at the atheists out  
[3:35:20](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12920) there  
[3:35:21](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12921) the reason why i'm looking at them is  
[3:35:23](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12923) because i think what i've sensed with a  
[3:35:25](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12925) lot of atheists when they watch our  
[3:35:27](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12927) streams it's like they come with a  
[3:35:28](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12928) mindset of i've got to defeat them i've  
[3:35:31](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12931) got to counteract them i've got to show  
[3:35:33](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12933) that they're wrong  
[3:35:34](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12934) and you know we appreciate them coming  
[3:35:36](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12936) on and watching it and things like that  
[3:35:40](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12940) but i hope they can appreciate that  
[3:35:42](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12942) we're trying to help them as well as the  
[3:35:44](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12944) other people as well as muslims as well  
[3:35:46](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12946) to really understand how to create an  
[3:35:49](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12949) argument yeah and that's why  
[3:35:51](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12951) you know i hope people like matthew and  
[3:35:53](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12953) others understand  
[3:35:55](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12955) how to create a good argument  
[3:35:58](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12958) in order to say okay  
[3:36:00](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12960) you know you you can now understand and  
[3:36:02](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12962) appreciate the ideas better  
[3:36:05](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12965) yeah on this particular you know when it  
[3:36:07](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12967) comes to the issue of critiquing other  
[3:36:08](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12968) people's world views you know it's like  
[3:36:10](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12970) terry came on he said i'm going to make  
[3:36:13](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12973) an internal critique and he didn't even  
[3:36:15](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12975) know the the positions within islam  
[3:36:18](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12978) so  
[3:36:19](https://youtu.be/e9A6HTKrfno?t=12979) you know just
