In an age of information overload and widespread pseudo-intellectualism, understanding the core foundations of Islam is as essential as ever.

The Qur'an provides convincing evidence for the existence of Allah, including visualized arguments about the universe and its creatures. Ibrahim al-Ismail questions the existence of the stars and moon, but is reassured by Allah's guidance. The sun, moon, and stars follow patterns and laws set by Allah, and cannot be explained without a creator. This leads Ibrahim to profess faith in Allah alone.

**00:00:00(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULVQnMHfEk&t=0)** The Quran discusses the existence of a Creator and provides evidence for this belief. Ibn Kathir explains that understanding the creations of the heavens and Earth and the alternations of night and day are all Signs for intelligent people to contemplate upon and come to the conclusion that Allah exists. Ibrahim's story is used to illustrate this point.
* **00:05:00(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULVQnMHfEk&t=300)** The Qur'an provides convincing evidence for the existence of Allah, including visualized arguments about the universe and its creatures. Ibrahim al-Ismail questions the existence of the stars and moon, but is reassured by Allah's guidance.

* **00:10:00(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULVQnMHfEk&t=600)** The Qur'an provides evidence for the existence of Allah. Ibrahim al-Hassam pointed out that when one turns to Allah in repentance, they are not considered a polytheist and can understand this evidence. The take-home message is to reflect on the reality of Allah's existence, and to appreciate this evidence through deep thought.
