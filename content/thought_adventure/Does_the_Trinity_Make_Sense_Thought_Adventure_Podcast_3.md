## Description

Trinity, in Christian doctrine, the unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead. The doctrine of the Trinity is considered to be one of the central Christian affirmations about God, but does it make sense? We invite Christians to discuss how the doctrine is a reasonable belief.

## Summary of [Does the Trinity Make Sense? | Thought Adventure Podcast #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA)

\*<span style="color:red; font-size:125%">This summary is AI generated - there may be inaccuracies</span>.

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=3600)

discusses the Trinity and argues that it is a logical possibility that can be believed by rational people.  goes on to say that there are plausible explanations for why the Trinity might exist, including the possibility that it is a logical possibility.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=0)** In this third episode of the Thought Adventure Podcast, Jake from the Muslim Metaphysician discusses the Trinity with Christians, noting that it makes sense according to rational understanding and that there should be no conflict between belief in a creator and theology.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=300)** The Trinity is a Christian doctrine which states that there is one God who exists amongst three persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Different theologians and philosophers explain how this three-in-one thing works, and Jake explains that the reason they chose 7:00pm as the time for this episode is because SCDWA is currently live.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=600)** The Trinity makes no sense to Muslims because it is an illogical doctrine with contradictory statements about who is God.
*   **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=900)** The Trinity is a doctrine that has been debated by theologians for centuries. The Trinity consists of one God who is three in one--Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--and yet they are not the same. There is an apparent problem with the doctrine because it does not make sense.
*   **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=1200)** The Trinity is a problem because it appears to be a contradiction in terms for God to be fully God and fully human. To reconcile this apparent contradiction,christians have adopted the doctrine of theosis, which means that Jesus Christ becomes fully God in a way that satisfies the demands of the doctrine.
*   **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=1500)** The transcript excerpt discusses a possible problem with the Trinity, and how one might approach it with other Christians. The hosts invite Muslims to come join the discussion, and after a delay, one Muslim participant joins. The hosts then discuss the problem of the Trinity with the Muslim participant, and how it is affirmed by Christian philosophers.
*   **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=1800)** The Thought Adventure Podcast explores the concept of the Trinity and argues that it makes sense. The Christian belief in the Trinity is accurately represented, and it does not misrepresent the Christian belief.
*   **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=2100)** The Trinity makes logical sense according to the rules of human thought, but it is an exception to the rules that prove God doesn't need to follow those same rules. The Trinity is a divine being that is divided into three parts, one part as the Father, another as the Holy Spirit, and the last as the human aspect of God. This divine being is capable of being at three places at once and in three forms.
*   **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=2400)** The Trinity is a concept that is difficult for some people to understand, and Sir argues that it does not matter which properties the Persons have that are different from one another, as they are all God. He goes on to say that if one believes in the Bible 100% then they must also believe in the Quran and Hadith, as they are all from God. He finishes the argument by saying that there are no rules that apply to all three versions of God, and that it is up to the individual to decide which doctrines they want to follow.
*   \**[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=2700)* Discusses the concept of 'god' and whether or not it makes sense. The presenter argues that god is logically possible, and that without him, reality would be meaningless. He goes on to say that even though people may have incoherent beliefs about god, this does not mean that he is not a necessary being.
*   **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=3000)** The Trinity is a difficult concept to understand, and some people believe that it is incoherent. The discussion is about whether or not the Trinity makes sense and whether or not it is possible for God to be free. Camden argues that it doesn't matter what the topic of discussion is, as the epistemology (the way in which we believe) of those who believe in the Trinity is wrong.
*   **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=3300)** of the YouTube video argues that the trinity is not logically incoherent, and that it can be plausibly believed by rational people. He goes on to say that there are plausible explanations for why the trinity might exist, including the possibility that it is a logical possibility.

### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=7200)

, two advocates for the Trinity argue that the doctrine of the Trinity does not logically lead to polytheism. One advocate points out that if one defines the persons of the Trinity as being identical to one another, then one falls into modalism, while the other argues that defining the persons of the Trinity as being separate from one another results in social trinitarianism or a version of polytheism. Neither advocate argues that the Trinity makes sense.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=3600)** The Trinity makes sense to one Christian, but it is contradictory to another. explains that there are three logical possibilities when it comes to the Trinity: logically possible, necessary, and impossible. also explains that these three categories are not the same, and that it is contradictory for one Christian to believe in a God with a logical impossibility as a miracle.

*   **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=3900)** The Thought Adventure Podcast discusses the Trinity and how it makes sense according to orthodox Christianity. The podcast discusses how the three hypostases of the Trinity are each identical to the essence of God, and that they are distinct from each other by relation. The podcast also discusses how the one who is known and the thing known of oneself are identical in essence, and that this is referred to as the Logos.
*   **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=4200)** The Trinity is a claim that states that three individuals who are considered to be the same being in terms of essence, yet are different in terms of properties, make sense.  explores how this claim violates the law of identity, which states that two things cannot be identical and have different properties.
*   **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=4500)** The Trinity does not make sense according to Islamic teaching, because it would imply that the persons are not separate from the essence. According to Christian teaching, the persons are identical to the essence. Identity is not a real property, but it is a real thing.
*   \**[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=4800)* Discusses the problem of the Trinity, which orthodox Christians believe to be a logical problem. neo argues that there is a metaphysical problem with this belief, as it is not possible to explain how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from one another without implying a level of unity between them that does not exist in reality.
*   **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=5100)** , two advocates for the Trinity argue that the doctrine of the Trinity does not logically lead to polytheism. One advocate points out that if one defines the persons of the Trinity as being identical to one another, then one falls into modalism, while the other argues that defining the persons of the Trinity as being separate from one another results in social trinitarianism or a version of polytheism. Neither advocate argues that the Trinity makes sense.
*   \**[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=5400)* Discusses the problem of divine simplicity, which is the idea that God is a single, simple entity with certain essential attributes. If this is true, then it must be the case that God's one act of creation is identical to his existence and therefore is necessary. However, orthodox Christianity denies this, asserting that God's act of creation is free. argues that there is something beyond our comprehension that we can't even name, and that this something is also eternal alongside God.
*   **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=5700)** In this third Thought Adventure podcast, hosts discuss the problem of reconciling the doctrine of the Trinity with the idea of divine simplicity. While both doctrines imply a divine nature that is simple and unified, the two concepts are not logically reconcilable. Justin arrives and joins the discussion, admitting that he does not have a satisfactory answer to the problem.
*   **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=6000)** The Trinity is a topic of discussion between two people, one of whom does not understand it. The problem with divine simplicity is that it does not make sense that the persons are identical to the essence, and when Russell's paradox is brought up, it is pointed out that this paradox is the result of a necessary line of reasoning that is valid. Both muslims and Christians believe that our reason takes us to this point, but Islam has a problem with the idea that the attributes are identical to God.
*   \**[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=6300)* Discusses the difference between the Trinity and the idea of a necessary being, and argues that the latter is a problem because it leads to metaphysical questions that cannot be answered. Brother Sharif mentions that the Muslim scholars have addressed this issue.
*   **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=6600)** The Trinity is a mystery that Christians cannot fully understand, and in conversations about it, they often shift the goalposts. Justin Satriano, one of the guests on the Thought Adventure Podcast, came up with an argument that the Trinity cannot be logically refuted.
*   **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=6900)** The Trinity is a mystery to some, but it makes sense within the context of absolute divine simplicity. Bohmian mechanics is a physical theory that can explain the double slit experiment without the need for additional physical entities.

### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=7200) - [02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=9600)

The Trinity is a concept that is often debated, with some people claiming that it makes sense and others claiming that it does not. In this episode of the Thought Adventure Podcast, the hosts discuss the appeal to mystery in Christianity and Islam and how it avoids ontological and metaphysical costs in one's faith. They also discuss how Jesus is limited in his being, and how this might limit God.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=7200)** The Trinity is a concept that is often debated, but one scientist attempts to disprove it by explaining that it is an in principle problem that one can never work out both the position and speed of a particle at the same time.

*   **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=7500)** The Trinity makes sense according to the Thought Adventure Podcast because it follows causality. If there is no naturalistic cause to explain quantum level events, then the cause must be non-naturalistic. This would lead to the conclusion that there is a non-logical possibility that trinity is true and false at the same time. This would have serious consequences for epistemology, as anything could be true or false.
*   **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=7800)** The Trinity makes little sense to an atheist, because how can you know that your own rationality comes from a god that can do anything outside of logic? This argument undermines any apologetics.
*   **[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=8100)** Dave Down the Road argues that the Trinity does not make sense because there is no connection between the claims made. He argues that if someone believes in the Trinity, they must also believe in some absurd claims, such as that God can stop existing.
*   **[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=8400)** The Trinity makes sense? Thought Adventure Podcast #3 discusses how the Trinity can make sense despite various inconsistencies. The problem with the Trinity is that it presupposes the thing it is trying to deny, which becomes unfair because the methodologies used to justify it are based on assumptions which are themselves based on mystery and contradiction.
*   **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=8700)** of the video discusses how the Trinity does not make sense and why it is wrong-ed to use it as a point of reference for the mysterious nature of God. He also discusses how the witness testimony of a woman is greater than that of a man and why it is equal to a man's.
*   \**[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=9000)* Discusses the difference in law between male and female testimony in Islamic law. Female testimony is considered greater than male testimony, due to the fact that women are more knowledgeable about certain aspects of life.
*   **[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=9300)** The Trinity does not make sense, according to the three Christian guests on this Thought Adventure Podcast. The double testimony requirement specified in the Quran is not found in other biblical passages, and there is a logical problem with the claim that the Trinity makes sense.
*   **[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ66-gtAYA\&t=9600)** In this third episode of the Thought Adventure Podcast, hosts Abdulrahman and Sharif discuss the appeal to mystery in Christianity and Islam and how it avoids ontological and metaphysical costs in one's faith. They also discuss how Jesus is limited in his being, and how this might limit God. Finally, they mention that they have set up social media accounts and provide links.

[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=63) the muslim metaphysician it's a\
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=65) difficult word that\
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=67) they're trying to say without getting\
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=68) our tongue twisted how you doing bro\

[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=87) but yeah we're doing our controller\
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=89) we've temporarily lost\
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=90) abdul rahman it looks like he's just cut\
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=92) off so he should be back with us in a\
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=94) moment\
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=95) but yeah so what we're obviously gonna\
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=97) do is we're gonna discuss that we're\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=98) gonna invite\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=98) christians on and obviously they can try\
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=100) to defend that and\
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=102) we'll have a little back and forth with\
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=103) them but we should probably start off\
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=106) by trying to sort of i guess explain\
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=109) what the trinity is\
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=110) uh you know with uh being as charitable\
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=112) as possible according to how the\
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=115) christians\
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=116) would view that uh so if brother james i\
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=119) was going to say\
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=120) just before jake uh introduces a\
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=122) discussion about trinity i think it's a\
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=124) good discussion\
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=125) just to introduce the point uh about\
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=128) how you know last time we had our show\
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=131) two weeks ago we were talking about\
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=133) is belief in a creator rational uh\
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=136) belief in other spanish\
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=137) is it rational or not and we came\
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=139) certain conclusions\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=140) obviously there's lots more to discuss\
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=142) about that but we talked about how there\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=144) is a necessary being\
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=146) that's not like things that we see so\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=148) it's not similar\
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=149) similar to you know things within the\
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=152) universe or contingent beings\
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=154) there's a necessary unlimited\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=155) independent creator who created\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=158) uh and so then you know as a muslim\
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=161) or even just as a human being what we\
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=163) don't do now\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=164) is presuppose our religion and then try\
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=168) to superimpose that to try to fit the\
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=170) argument\
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=171) what we should do as human beings is\
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=174) if we've rationally come to this\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=176) conclusion prior to any revelation\
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=178) then we would obviously naturally ask\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=180) the question you know is there a\
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=183) revelation from god and obviously we\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=185) have lots of people claiming that\
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=186) there's revelation from god\
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=188) but we need to test the revelation those\
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=190) claims and one of the ways to test it\
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=192) is whether the conception of the creator\
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=195) fits within this rational understanding\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=198) of\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=198) uh how we approached or how we came to\
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=201) the existence of god so this is a very\
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=202) basic thing\
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=203) if some religion claims to be from a\
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=206) creator\
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=207) but says the creator is a contingent\
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=209) being is a limited finite dependent\
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=211) being\
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=212) then you can say well this isn't really\
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=214) truly from this\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=215) unlimited independent creator and so\
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=218) it's not a case of presupposing what our\
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=221) religious text says\
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=223) but rather looking at the claim in order\
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=226) to test the claim whether it fits\
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=228) or whether it agrees with the rational\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=230) understanding\
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=231) and how we approach rationally the\
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=233) existence of the creator in the first\
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=235) place there shouldn't be\
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=236) a conflict between these two things if\
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=239) the revelation is truly from this\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=240) unlimited creator i thought i'd just\
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=243) introduced that just really quickly so\
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=246) context yeah so i agree that was a good\
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=250) place to start\
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=251) so should we begin as well by um trying\
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=253) to kind of explain what the trinity is\
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=255) the best of our abilities so if the\
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=257) christians are watching\
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=258) they can at least know that the\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=259) understanding that we have of what the\
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=260) trinity is is at least\
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=262) uh fair and that we're you know we're\
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=264) not just gonna kind of jump straight in\
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=266) with a straw man uh so jake do you want\
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=267) to take the lead on that and\
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=269) do your best to kind of explain what the\
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=271) trinity is according to\
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=272) uh the uh the more popular christian\
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=276) doctrine obviously\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=277) there's differences in terms of how to\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=279) explain the trinity\
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=280) um but if you could just give the the\
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=282) most accepted version off that\
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=284) and if you want to you could obviously\
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=285) make mention of um maybe some\
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=288) what the majority would consider\
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=289) heretical but obviously those that\
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=291) take these little offshoot ideas um\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=294) don't see as heretical but yeah so you\
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=296) take the lead there bro\
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=297) right yeah and before i get into that i\
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=300) just want to\
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=301) reiterate to our audience uh christians\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=304) muslims who's ever watching\
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=306) what this podcast is about and what\
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=308) we're trying to do\
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=310) we're trying to have discussions about\
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=314) topics that we feel are important\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=317) and we may disagree with some of the\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=319) viewers who are watching who decide to\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=321) come on and have a discussion with us\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=324) but we want to be as charitable as\
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=326) possible to the other people's views\
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=329) represent them as accurately as we can\
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=331) and when we disagree\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=332) we disagree with respect and you know\
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=336) proper\
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=336) um you know respectfulness in the\
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=339) conversation so\
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=341) i just want to reiterate it for the\
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=342) people who do come on\
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=344) if you disagree with us or if you agree\
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=347) we don't want to sort of demean other\
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=349) people we want to have\
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=351) an honest uh conversation at the end of\
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=353) the day we're inviting people to the\
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=355) dean of islam and\
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=357) we think that this is the best way to do\
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=359) it so i just want to\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=360) reiterate that for our viewers yeah\
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=364) yeah unless you guys have anything else\
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=366) to add on that yeah it's just\
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=368) basically the the whole point of this is\
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=370) to have a\
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=372) an emphasis and a focus on etiquette\
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=374) good etiquette so\
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=376) you know anyone's welcome to jump on and\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=378) have this conversation with us so long\
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=379) as you\
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=380) are well-mannered and we will be\
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=382) well-mannered also we do have someone in\
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=384) the background for the mustachin\
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=386) and we've specifically give him orders\
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=388) to tell us\
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=389) as well if we ever get um a bit out of\
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=391) hand or if we become\
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=393) you know we cross any lines and if our\
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=395) etiquettes lack in any way\
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=396) so it's not just going to be the viewers\
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=398) that are going to be held to account in\
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=399) terms of how they\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=400) present themselves or how they engage um\
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=402) the whole thing is supposed to be\
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=404) a cordial environment and obviously\
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=407) there's a\
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=408) um a responsibility and a duty on us\
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=410) sort of hold that as well\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=411) so yeah i just wanted to kind of add\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=414) that a little bit there but yeah so\
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=415) you you go ahead bro and take the leap\
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=418) all right yeah so the trinity is a\
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=421) christian doctrine\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=422) obviously it's basically the\
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=424) understanding\
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=425) that there's one god or one being of god\
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=430) that exists amongst three persons the\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=432) father son and holy spirit so\
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=435) each one of these persons typically is\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=438) understood as being fully divine or\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=440) fully god\
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=441) and yet there's only one god which is\
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=443) the one being of god\
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=445) now exactly how that works and\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=448) how it's explained uh differs depending\
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=451) on\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=452) um sort of what theologian you're\
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=454) looking at or what philosopher is\
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=456) explaining\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=457) um how this three-in-one thing works\
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=461) and there's different schools of thought\
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=463) as you know we can go into detail if we\
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=465) have to with any of the guests but\
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=467) i'm going to not really go too much in\
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=469) depth with it because\
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=471) i want to keep it as simple as possible\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=473) for the viewers so if anybody wants to\
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=475) go in like\
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=476) really deep into explaining the\
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=478) different models and things like that we\
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=480) can\
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=481) but just on a very broad uh general\
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=484) level\
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=485) uh the trinity is the idea that there's\
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=487) one god there's one\
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=488) essence nature substance of god that\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=492) exists amongst three persons there's a\
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=493) father son and holy spirit\
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=495) christians believe that this is a\
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=497) doctrine that's uh found in their\
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=499) scripture\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=500) or that's grounded in their scriptures\
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=502) and their early creeds\
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=503) and for the most part that's why they\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=506) believe in it\
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=507) um now we may differ with them in uh in\
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=510) that respect and obviously as muslims\
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=512) uh we don't accept the idea that god is\
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=515) a trinity we believe that\
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=516) uh god is completely one um that he's\
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=520) not dependent upon\
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=521) anything else and that there's no\
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=523) multiplicity in god in the sense of\
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=526) of there being three persons so i want\
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=528) to keep it um\
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=529) i think that's fine as far as\
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=532) contrasting the views and just kind of\
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=534) briefly explaining what the trinity is\
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=536) if we need to go into more detail we can\
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=539) i don't know if you guys have anything\
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=541) else to add to that as far as explaining\
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=544) you know what the trinity is and um\
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=548) you know if you guys want to comment you\
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=550) can no i think that was pretty fair um i\
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=553) guess we could at this point ask\
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=554) the viewers um you know if you're a\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=557) christian in the chat\
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=558) hit one and put that into the chat just\
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=562) type one\
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=563) and hit enter uh if you think that what\
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=565) jake just said there is a fair\
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=566) representation\
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=568) of the christian doctrine of trinity\
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=571) uh and you know so it and two if you\
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=573) don't if you disagree with his uh thing\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=575) there then we can kind of get an idea\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=577) so we've got one from chris claus\
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=580) uh kind of give it a moment so while it\
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=584) comes salon to everyone who's joining us\
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=586) we've got 41 live just to touch on this\
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=588) as well so uh we are aware\
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=591) that s c dawa happens to be live\
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=594) at the exact same moment now with the\
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=596) previous two the reason we chose seven\
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=598) o'clock is because\
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=599) we thought that it was bang in the\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=600) middle of the\
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=602) um the two major channels so i think ef\
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=605) that will usually go on quite early\
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=607) um and they use uh in the previous two\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=610) streams they would do one and then\
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=611) finish round about seven uh and then\
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=614) essie dower would usually jump on about\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=616) half\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=616) eight nine o'clock um and so we picked\
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=619) this time\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=620) just kind of be regular and just kind of\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=623) sit in the middle of these two\
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=624) um but sc dawa are not uh consistent\
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=627) with their timing and they kind of move\
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=628) it about\
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=629) obviously depending on the guests and\

[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=669) don't\
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=669) have any kind of disagreements there uh\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=671) should we move into\
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=672) like a critique or do you want to just\
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=675) kind of get some christians in and start\
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=676) having a conversation\
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=678) maybe let's just like go around i'll\
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=681) give an explanation to\
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=682) because we're asking the question does\
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=684) the trinity make sense\
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=686) um so let's give a chance for each one\
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=687) of us to kind of run through it\
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=689) yes or no and then explain why and then\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=692) we can\
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=693) bring the christians on one by one i\
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=695) guess and see what they have to say\
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=697) about it\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=698) yeah that's fun yeah so in my analysis\
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=702) and people who aren't familiar with my\
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=704) stuff um\
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=705) you can go and check out my channel the\
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=707) muslim metaphysician\
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=709) um i typically have debates or dialogues\
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=712) with christian scholars\
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=714) on this topic of the trinity incarnation\
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=716) stuff like that\
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=719) but now with respect to the question\
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=721) does the trinity make sense\
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=723) what does that even mean well for me it\
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=725) means\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=726) can we make sense of it in the senses\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=729) that is it\
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=730) rational is it logically comprehensible\
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=732) can we\
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=733) understand what it even means uh and\
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=736) from my perspective\
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=738) the answer is no because i think that\
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=741) ultimately it is an illogical or\
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=744) irrational doctrine and you know i don't\
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=747) mean that\
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=748) in an offensive way to my christian\
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=750) friends or the people we're going to\
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=751) have on there but\
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=753) ultimately that is my understanding um\
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=756) and so i i've made videos on the past on\
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=760) things like uh the logical problem of\
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=762) the trinity so i'm just going to briefly\
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=764) explain what that is\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=765) and why my claim is that the the\
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=768) doctrine of the trinity\
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=769) is illogical so basically the logical\
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=772) problem of the trinity and it's not\
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=773) something that i made up\
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=775) i'm going to read a quote from here in a\
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=777) second after i explain what it is\
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=779) but it's basically the idea\
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=782) that the father is god the son is god\
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=786) the holy spirit is god each of the\
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=788) persons are not\
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=790) each other so each of the persons are\
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=792) not identical to one another\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=794) and yet there's only one god now why is\
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=797) that a logical problem\
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=799) the logical problem is the claim that we\
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=801) have\
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=802) three you can look out of it at it sort\
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=805) of two different ways\
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=806) we have three is god statements so we're\
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=809) saying that these\
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=810) three individuals the father is god the\
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=813) son is god\
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=814) the holy spirit is god now the question\
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=816) is if we're saying\
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=817) each one of these three is god\
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=821) and it's an is of identity then it would\
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=824) follow that the father is identical to\
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=827) the sun\
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=828) but yet we're also being told that the\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=830) father is not identical to the sun\
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=833) now what do i mean by that it's similar\
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=836) to\
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=836) um for example my name is jake\
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=839) brancatella\
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=840) but i also go by the name the muslim\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=842) metaphysician\
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=843) now if i say jake brancatella is the\
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=846) muslim metaphysician\
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=848) and are those two things the same thing\
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=851) well of course in this\
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=852) aspect jake brancatologist is the muslim\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=856) metaphysician so we are\
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=857) identical to one another there's only\
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=859) actually one thing\
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=860) that's being described and those terms\
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=863) just refer to the exact same thing which\
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=865) is me\
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=866) now in the case of the trinity we're\
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=868) being told that the father is god\
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=870) and the son is god so they're identical\
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=873) to whatever god\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=874) is but yet they're not identical to one\
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=877) another\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=878) and that seems to violate what's called\
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=880) the law of identity\
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=882) or leibniz's law because if two things\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=885) are identical to one another then they\
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=888) have to share the same properties\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=890) that means whatever is true of one has\
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=893) to be true of\
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=894) the other thing if they are the same\
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=896) thing which is god\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=898) now if they differ in terms of their\
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=900) properties then they can't be the same\
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=902) thing\
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=904) so it seems to violate the law of\
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=905) identity on the one hand\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=907) on the other hand if you say that it's\
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=910) in what's called an\
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=911) is of predication meaning it's a\
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=913) property that's being ascribed to the\
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=915) individuals\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=916) then it seems to result in tritheism\
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=920) or there being three gods because of the\
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=922) fact that you're saying\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=923) each one of these three things are not\
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=926) identical to each other\
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=927) and yet there's only one god but it\
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=930) seems like there's three gods\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=932) and i give an example in my video\
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=935) when i explain for example i say jake is\
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=938) a human\
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=939) john is a human james is a human jake is\
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=942) not john\
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=943) jake is not james john is not james\
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=946) there's exactly one human well it\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=948) doesn't make sense because it seems to\
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=949) follow from there being these three\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=952) individuals who are not each other that\
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=954) there's exactly\
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=956) three men not one man and i know people\
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=960) seem\
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=960) think that this is kind of a straw man\
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=962) but actually saint gregory of nissa\
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=964) gives this as an example when he\
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=966) discusses the issue\
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=968) and he actually argues that there's only\
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=970) one man\
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=971) instead of there being three men because\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=973) this is you know\
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=974) sort of the analogy i'm just going to\
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=976) read one quote\
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=978) on this logical problem of the trinity\
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=981) and then i'm going to pass it over to\
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=982) the other brothers\
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=984) in the introduction of a book which is\
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=988) called uh the philosophical and\
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=991) theological essays on the trinity\
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=994) literally\
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=994) in the intro on the first page\
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=998) it says what theologians sometimes refer\
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1001) to\
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1001) as the threeness oneness problem of the\
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1004) trinity\
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1005) and what prob and what philosoph uh\
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1007) philosophers call the logical problem of\
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1009) the trinity\
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1010) is well known it arises from the\
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1013) conjunction of three central tenets\
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1015) of the doctrine there is exactly one god\
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1018) that's premise one premise two the\
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1021) father son and holy spirit are not\
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1023) identical which i explained they're not\
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1025) identical to one another and premise\
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1028) three the father son and holy spirit\
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1031) are consubstantial meaning that they\
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1033) have the same essence or being\
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1036) so the only reason i'm reading that\
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1037) quote is to show\
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1039) that this three-ness oneness problem or\
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1041) what philosophers\
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1042) christian philosophers and this is\
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1044) written this entire text is written by\
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1047) christian academics um they call the\
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1050) logical problem of the trinity it's not\
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1052) something that\
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1052) jake is making up as an as a biased\
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1055) muslim\
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1056) this is a problem that's well known in\
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1058) the contemporary um\
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1061) christian academic literature on the\
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1063) subject\
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1064) and so i wanted to just explain that so\
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1067) that people don't think that this is\
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1068) just something\
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1070) that uh we are making up now i want to\
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1072) pass it on to\
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1074) uh the other brothers to give their\
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1077) input\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1078) as to what they think about the trinity\
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1080) whether or not you guys\
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1082) think it makes sense and if it doesn't\
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1084) um\
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1085) sort of what your thoughts on that\
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1086) actually are\
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1089) yeah for that so is there anyone who\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1091) wants to go\
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1092) first abdulrahman yeah\
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1095) i can say something um yeah so so\
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1099) yeah i wanted to to start off by saying\
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1102) that um\
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1103) uh first of all i might just just to lay\
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1105) some groundwork for it for for the\
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1106) discussion\
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1108) we're having um and i've heard jake say\
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1110) say this many times\
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1112) uh we're not we're not really saying\
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1115) that\
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1116) you know if the trinity is incoherent\
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1118) that means islam is true because a lot\
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1120) of people just\
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1120) right off the bat that's that's the kind\
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1122) of impression that they're getting\
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1123) we're just uh saying that there is an\
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1126) apparent problem\
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1127) apparent logical problem with the\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1129) trinity and uh\
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1130) i'm not sure if jack jake went over this\
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1133) but the difference between an apparent\
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1135) problem and an actual logical problem is\
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1136) that\
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1137) you can accept that there is an apparent\
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1139) problem like i can accept that there is\
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1140) an apparent\
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1141) logical problem within an islamic\
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1143) doctrine for example\
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1144) and the fact that it's an apparent\
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1146) logical problem doesn't mean that it's\
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1148) an actual problem\
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1149) so by acknowledging that there is an\
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1151) apparent logical problem with the\
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1153) trinity i'm not\
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1154) or by acknowledging that there's an\
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1155) apparent problem with\
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1157) one of the doctrines that i believe in\
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1159) i'm not\
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1160) kind of like saying that i don't believe\
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1162) in it anymore what what you do\
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1164) from then on is that you need to do some\
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1165) work in order to show that\
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1167) it's not an actual problem and that it's\
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1170) merely an apparent problem\
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1171) i mean that that would at least be your\
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1173) objective if you're going to hold on to\
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1175) the belief\
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1176) and and and i think i think that's very\
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1178) important to note because a lot of\
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1180) people hesitate to acknowledge that\
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1182) there is\
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1182) a problem at all like they say there's\
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1184) no problem in the first place\
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1186) uh and and and i think that's just a\
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1188) result of them not understanding what\
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1190) an apparent problem is so so yeah i\
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1194) thought that that would be important to\
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1195) point out and the other thing\
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1196) as i mentioned is that it's not like if\
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1199) the trinity\
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1200) is is false that like that means islam\
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1203) is true like there are unitarian\
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1204) christians right\
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1206) there's judaism there there are other\
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1207) beliefs that\
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1209) kind of uh even within christianity uh\
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1213) i mean probably not considered orthodoxy\
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1215) but but people who do consider\
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1216) themselves christians\
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1217) are who are not trinitarians they kind\
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1220) of have\
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1221) ways to evade this problem um\
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1224) yeah i i so i i think that's it for now\
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1228) i i think that's just to get people to\
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1230) to\
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1231) to be more open to the idea that there\
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1233) is an apparent\
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1234) problem worth discussing you know we're\
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1237) not saying that it's an actual problem\
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1238) from\
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1239) from from the outset we're just saying\
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1240) there's an apparent problem that's worth\
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1241) discussing and maybe\
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1243) and there are a lot of proposed\
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1244) solutions to this obviously we don't\
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1246) think the solutions work\
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1247) but that's the discussion that needs to\
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1249) be had\
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1254) yes definitely uh sharish do you want to\
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1256) have a quick say on the matter\
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1259) yeah just really quickly um i think one\
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1262) of the\
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1262) the ways uh obviously is the problem\
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1265) that exists and i think obviously jake's\
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1267) mentioned the problem\
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1268) uh you know uh summarized it quite well\
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1271) but the problem exists because of the\
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1273) way the new testament text\
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1276) or the way christians have interpreted\
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1278) the new testament text\
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1280) to to understand that jesus and the holy\
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1283) ghost of the holy spirit\
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1285) are actually gods but at the same time\
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1287) trying to affirm that there is only one\
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1289) being of god so there's this uh\
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1292) inherent tension within the way it's\
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1295) been read\
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1296) and interpreted and so\
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1299) the issue then becomes is there is an\
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1301) obligation to try to reconcile this\
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1304) it can't just be a question about well\
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1306) it's mysterious because we're talking\
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1308) about god\
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1308) it's like for example if i turn around\
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1310) and i said somebody knocking on the door\
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1312) and then i i'm i tell the the person\
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1315) who's knocking the door i say\
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1316) it's both a man and also a fully man and\
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1320) a fully child\
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1321) yeah or is a person who's six foot tall\
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1324) and five foot tall\
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1326) now on a primer phaser just uh\
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1329) you know understanding of that there's\
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1330) an apparent contradiction\
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1332) and so the onus is upon me\
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1336) to try to explain how that contradiction\
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1339) or the apparent contradiction is not a\
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1342) logical impossibility\
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1343) but a logical possibility so if somebody\
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1346) turns around and tries to claim that\
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1348) there's one god\
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1349) while also acknowledging jesus and the\
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1352) holy ghost and the father is being god\
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1354) then they are under the obligation to\
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1357) try to reconcile\
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1359) otherwise it will fall into tritheism\
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1362) yeah i believe in more than one god so i\
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1364) think just\
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1365) uh as a as a point is the mystery card\
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1368) can't just be used saying that god's\
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1370) unfair\
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1370) fathomable and we cannot understand god\
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1372) rather it has to be explained because of\
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1375) the\
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1376) propositions that are being uh placed in\
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1379) in the concept of uh christian trinity\
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1381) unitarianism\
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1385) yeah so i think you guys have pretty\
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1387) much covered most things\
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1388) i'll just extend on what brother sharath\
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1390) was saying a little bit there\
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1392) so with regards to this idea that god is\
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1394) fully of jesus\
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1397) is fully god and fully human um\
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1400) that you know as he kind of mentioned it\
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1402) this is similar to saying\
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1404) uh that someone is fully five\
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1407) foot tall and fully six foot tall\
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1409) there's there are qualities\
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1411) um of being a human like all of us here\
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1414) we're all human\
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1415) and what every human has in common is\
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1418) that they're not god we all have\
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1419) finite attributes and that's what it\
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1421) means to be fully human it means\
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1424) to you know be a created being\
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1427) and to not have any um\
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1430) infinite qualities we are not\
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1431) all-knowing we are not all-powerful\
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1434) we are not any of these things um\
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1437) and never have been and this is\
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1440) quite clear to i think even the\
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1442) christians that that is what makes us\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1444) human we\
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1445) uh you know we we don't have any of the\
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1447) attributes of god\
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1449) um in infinite quantities whereas\
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1452) here when you say that jesus allowed is\
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1455) fully god that is to say that he has 100\
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1459) all of these qualities and he's fully\
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1461) human which is to say what we've just\
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1463) said well what i've just said there\
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1465) with regards to um you know not being\
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1468) god you you've then got this issue with\
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1470) your you're affirming\
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1472) a conjunction of contradictory terms\
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1474) you're saying\
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1475) that jesus is a he is fully a\
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1478) and he is fully not a that is he is\
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1481) you know completely um you know the\
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1484) quality of um\
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1486) of being all-knowing so he he is\
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1488) all-knowing and he is not all-knowing\
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1490) simultaneously and then\
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1492) obviously you can go through all of\
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1493) these attributes and you're affirming\
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1494) them and then denying them\
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1496) in one breath as a conjunction um which\
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1498) is\
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1499) a complete contradiction and\
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1502) obviously problematic for that reason um\
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1505) so\
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1506) i'll just kind of leave it there i i\
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1507) don't want to kind of ramble on for too\
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1509) long it's a shame there was um\
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1510) a christian that was on here a moment\
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1513) ago um\
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1514) for some reason he feels it was\
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1516) unreasonable to have an introduction\
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1518) um kind of putting forward our thoughts\
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1520) on the matter uh but yeah so should we\
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1522) get some\
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1523) people on so we've got uh someone called\
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1526) i just want to invite mostly christians\
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1528) here obviously we would prefer to have a\
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1529) conversation specifically with people\
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1531) who want to defend the trinity um but\
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1534) we've got two people waiting in the back\
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1535) now so we'll begin with the\
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1536) the first person uh hello\
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1541) hello ray guys how are you\
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1544) uh yeah i'm doing i've got it so are you\
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1546) um muslim or are you\
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1548) christian what's your question you're\
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1551) christian\
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1554) what you're trying to say here is that\
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1558) god and some cannot be\
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1561) like one god at one point so it was just\
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1564) wondering\
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1565) if you're talking any other christian\
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1567) about it or not\
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1570) yeah so that's what we're doing here now\
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1572) we're inviting and\
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1574) apart from me apart from me are you are\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1576) you talking to somebody\
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1578) who actually knows christian theology\
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1581) are you just like bunch of muslim guys\
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1583) trying to\
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1584) discuss trinity i mean not being\
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1586) offensive\
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1587) no no no it's fine well the christian um\
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1591) jake for example he does engage with\
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1593) christians a lot if you check his\
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1594) channel out no no\
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1595) it's not like he engages with christians\
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1598) right\
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1598) it's about bringing a proper like\
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1601) an academic and christian theology\
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1604) trying to discuss it with him\
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1606) are you trying to do that because what\
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1608) you're doing is you're making\
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1610) suppositions right you're supposing\
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1612) things\
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1613) that you think are right in christianity\
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1616) but it's not as i say um\
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1619) you know the quantum superposition right\
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1623) an electron can be at two places at once\
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1626) that's been confirmed\
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1627) right no no i'm just giving a little bit\
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1629) of an idea yeah\
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1630) just kind of pause you there there's um\
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1632) an interpretation of that called bohmian\
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1634) mechanics\
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1635) which doesn't suppose that at all um\
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1643) what i'm trying to tell you is there are\
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1645) dimensions\
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1647) of everything right yep and you can't\
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1649) you cannot be\
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1650) talking about just one single dimension\
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1653) you're trying to understand things from\
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1654) one perspective\
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1656) and you're completely ignoring the other\
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1658) right\
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1659) so an electron can be a wave and a\
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1662) particle\
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1662) at the same time an electron or\
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1666) an elementary particle can be at two\
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1668) places at once\
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1670) how does it know apply to god well\
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1673) first of all we are inviting people on\
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1676) and uh the brother jake like i've just\
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1679) mentioned\
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1679) uh he's been engaging specifically with\
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1682) christine academics\
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1683) so that is he a christian\
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1687) no no we're inviting christians on now\
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1692) all i can say right now is four muslim\
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1694) guys trying to talk about christianity\
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1696) and their core beliefs\
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1698) which doesn't seem really intellectual\
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1700) to me\
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1701) i'm being very respectful i'm not trying\
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1703) to offend anyone right\
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1705) i'm so sorry i think you're confused\
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1706) like that no no no\
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1708) i think you're inc you're confused we've\
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1710) i've specifically made\
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1711) the point that we want christians to\
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1713) come on to engage with us that's why\
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1715) you're here\
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1716) i i said that explicitly right so i\
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1719) don't\
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1719) know is that is there any other question\
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1722) on the meeting\
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1727) the problem is i think what like\
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1730) of course we should engage with\
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1731) christians and we should be concerned\
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1732) with what christian academics says\
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1745) yeah let me just make this point so if\
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1746) you go to jake's channel his channel is\
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1748) called the muslim metaphysician he has\
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1750) discussions\
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1750) with christian academics phds\
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1753) philosophers\
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1754) who are specialized on the topic and in\
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1757) jake's intro he actually\
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1758) gave you quotes from christian\
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1760) philosophers and\
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1761) and and uh who actually affirm that\
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1764) there is uh\
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1766) something called the logical problem of\
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1768) the trinity and that's a\
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1769) a term coined not by muslims by\
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1772) christians themselves\
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1773) so of course we need to engage with\
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1775) christians but\
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1776) there's nothing inherently fallacious\
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1779) about discussing an idea you don't\
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1781) believe in if you do represent it well\
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1783) so i think instead of focusing on the\
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1785) fact that we're for muslims\
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1786) you should focus on the substance that\
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1788) we're putting forward whether the\
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1790) content\
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1790) is actually faithful to the christian\
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1793) beliefs which is why\
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1794) yusuf brother yusuf in the very\
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1796) beginning he said if there are any\
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1797) christians in the chat\
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1799) drop a one if you think that we've\
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1801) accurately represented the trinity\
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1803) and and that's what a lot of christians\
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1805) have done so we haven't misrepresented\
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1808) the christian christian belief in any\
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1809) sense if you think we have\
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1811) then i think it will be more useful for\
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1812) you to tell us how we've done that\
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1814) than to just put it out there that we're\
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1816) for muslims because i think that that's\
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1818) that's irrelevant it's so we\
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1821) we've put forward arguments the question\
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1823) is now brother do you want to engage\
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1825) with those arguments\
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1826) or do you want to make this fallacious\
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1828) claim that we're not\
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1829) engaging with christians while inviting\
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1832) christians and giving them priority\
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1834) to discuss the trinity like your point\
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1837) seems\
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1839) superfluous and sort of irrelevant\
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1842) you will think it sounds superfluous\
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1844) you're the one who i don't know who\
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1846) actually meeted me while i was in the\
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1847) midst of a sentence it's because you\
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1849) were interrupting him while he was\
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1850) trying to talk\
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1851) i wasn't i couldn't hear him well he was\
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1854) talking\
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1854) so we just grabbed you i couldn't hear\
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1856) him he was cutting off and a wee bit\
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1859) like so i tried to kind of maybe i\
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1862) thought\
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1862) he was trying to ask me a question and\
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1864) all right but all right what i'm trying\
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1866) to say is\
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1866) if an electron can be a wave in a\
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1869) particle\
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1870) at one point at one time\
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1873) how does not that not apply to god\
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1877) well can i just answer that point\
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1880) the problem is is that whenever we point\
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1884) to\
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1884) contingent realities uh these contingent\
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1887) realities like for example the way\
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1889) particle duality\
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1891) they operate according to a law yeah\
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1894) they are limited\
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1895) and they are dependent and so if you\
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1898) start to analogize\
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1900) of the creator with things what we call\
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1903) the creation or limited things\
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1905) then he starts to break down for example\
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1908) the way particle duality is\
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1910) is part of the idea that\
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1914) a photon is in multiple positions\
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1918) until there's an observational\
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1919) measurement that's taken\
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1921) and then the wave function collapses\
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1924) into a particular\
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1925) into a particle yeah of light a photon\
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1928) of light\
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1929) so the wave function yeah or the wave\
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1933) particle duality\
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1934) only exists prior to\
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1937) the observation of the thing yeah and\
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1940) really to be honest that's why i think\
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1942) even\
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1942) joseph mentioned the bohmian uh\
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1944) interpretation of quantum mechanics\
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1946) because\
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1947) it's really more of a theoretical thing\
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1949) it's like for example schrodinger's cat\
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1951) where you know there's a um\
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1954) poison that releases within a box the\
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1958) cat's inside the box\
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1960) at what point does the cat can you say\
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1962) the cat is dead well you'd say the cat\
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1964) is alive and dead at\
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1965) that moment until you open up the box\
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1968) and look inside\
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1969) and you'll be able to see whether the\
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1971) cat is alive or dead\
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1972) yeah so you know you gotta appreciate\
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1976) that\
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1976) the analogy doesn't work because the\
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1979) analogy in this context\
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1981) would be that after observation the\
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1984) particle\
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1985) is a hundred percent a particle and a\
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1987) hundred percent\
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1988) also a wave but the observation and the\
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1991) measurement\
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1991) affects that yeah so it and what we're\
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1994) saying regards to the trinity or\
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1996) what christians claim regards to the\
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1998) trinity is that\
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=1999) god is free people who are exactly\
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2004) god the god but at the same time are\
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2007) differentiated\
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2008) separate from one another because they\
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2010) have different properties\
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2012) and that's just one aspect of the\
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2013) problem the other aspect of the problem\
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2015) of the trinity would be the fact that\
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2017) it's something called a saity which\
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2019) means self-sufficiency or independence\
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2021) is only granted to the father and not to\
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2024) the other two\
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2025) so i think just the the quantum\
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2027) mechanics doesn't quite work\
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2029) as an analogy to prove this and i can\
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2032) share this it doesn't work\
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2033) how i feel to understand how does it all\
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2035) work well let me ask you this\
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2038) you say you say that it's logically\
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2041) impossible for god to be\
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2043) um let's say all-knowing and not\
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2044) all-knowing at the same time\
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2046) right yes because all knowing\
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2049) being five foot tall and six foot tall\
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2051) at the same time that's impossible\
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2053) logically is that right no no\
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2057) let's let's let's go to the question\
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2060) about god\
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2061) so he's saying god can be all-knowing\
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2063) and also at the same time ignorant\
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2067) not ignorant of course well\
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2070) if he i if god wishes to be why not\
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2074) so god can be or both all knowing as a\
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2077) necessary component\
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2078) to be god and at the same time be\
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2082) ignorant right what stop something\
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2085) who are we to stop him it's not about no\
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2088) no no it's not about us stopping him\
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2089) brother it's about the fact that if\
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2091) you're claiming that something\
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2093) is all-knowing that means that you have\
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2096) to negate\
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2098) ignorance from him like for example is\
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2100) it possible for god to have never\
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2101) existed\
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2102) when in the bible he's explicitly stated\
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2105) as himself being the eternal the one\
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2108) that without a beginning\
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2110) and without an end so if you were to say\
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2113) that god\
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2113) could have never existed\
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2116) you're you're going against the words of\
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2118) the bible itself\
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2120) which i'm not doing anything you are if\
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2123) you if you\
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2124) if you if you make a claim no no no i'm\
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2127) not i'm telling you the necessary\
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2129) consequence\
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2131) you don't get to tell me if i'm going\
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2132) against bible right\
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2134) no if the bible says as what i'm trying\
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2137) to tell you is\
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2138) how does eternity how is eternity\
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2141) measured\
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2142) when you have the concept of time right\
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2145) and when there is no concept of time\
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2148) there is no concept of eternity\
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2150) there is no concept of existence or\
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2152) non-existence right\
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2153) so god created time yes so his existence\
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2156) for our senses started\
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2159) when god ends time his existence\
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2163) stops for our senses if god wants to be\
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2166) ignorant he can be ignorant if god wants\
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2169) to be\
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2170) powerful he wants to be almighty all\
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2172) knowing he can be that\
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2174) i mean he doesn't really care about the\
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2176) logic that you and i follow\
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2179) if you say that how can an all-knowing\
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2181) person be\
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2182) ignorant well it's your logic i mean you\
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2185) have to describe\
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2186) what you mean by all knowing and what\
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2188) you need mean by ignorant right\
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2190) so when it comes to your god let's say\
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2192) when it comes to allah\
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2194) right what you do is you say\
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2197) god says in the quran\
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2204) right so the person who does something\
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2208) that is not needed\
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2209) right mumbai zarin they are the brothers\
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2213) of satan\
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2213) they are bad people right then you say\
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2216) allah who summoned\
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2217) god is someone right he doesn't need\
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2221) anything\
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2221) then why did he create the universe if\
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2224) he created the universe\
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2225) he didn't need that means he's putting\
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2228) himself\
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2229) in the same category of the people that\
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2231) don't need anything\
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2233) so that you don't need anything to do\
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2236) you're bringing up so many points right\
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2238) now\
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2239) i don't want to cut you off but if you\
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2241) start talking for two\
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2242) three minutes and just bring it up point\
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2244) after point we're not really going to be\
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2246) able to address what you're saying\
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2248) so let's try to keep my point okay i'm\
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2250) going to i'm going to what i'm going to\
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2251) do is i'm going to brief it\
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2252) right here what i would like you to do\
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2255) because when you first came on\
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2257) you seem to think that we were either\
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2259) misrepresenting the trinity or christian\
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2261) belief\
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2262) i'm not thinking about anything i have\
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2264) no presumptions\
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2265) about you guys well it seemed like you\
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2268) did sir\
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2269) but i want to give you a chance honestly\
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2271) i want you to explain\
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2273) us what the trinity is and explain to us\
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2276) how it isn't illogical go ahead\
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2281) all right okay now the trinity says\
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2284) there is one being one existence that is\
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2286) an absolute existence\
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2288) right then that existence is divided\
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2291) into three parts it could have been\
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2293) divided into 100 parts a billion parts\
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2295) it doesn't really matter\
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2297) for human mind that was divided into\
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2298) three parts one\
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2300) as a divine being like the father right\
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2303) the other as the holy spirit that\
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2306) carries out the commandments and all\
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2308) that in certain ways\
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2309) as you have rojo in islam right so\
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2313) similar to that\
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2314) the third one is the human aspect\
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2318) of god that wanted to teach humans\
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2321) what it is like to be divine at the same\
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2324) time\
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2325) how you need to be a good human right so\
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2327) that is the point\
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2328) now you're saying how is it possible\
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2331) then\
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2332) that one god can be at three places at\
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2334) once i mean\
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2335) of course logically it can't be true\
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2338) right it's not true\
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2340) logically but that logic is the\
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2342) construction\
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2343) of the human mind now what i'm trying to\
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2346) say is\
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2347) what is stopping god from abandoning\
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2350) your\
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2351) and my logic and being and three places\
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2355) at once what stops him\
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2358) don't tell me that the the rules and\
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2361) regulations that he created and all that\
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2363) because he doesn't need to follow them\
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2364) he doesn't follow them that's the\
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2366) miracles\
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2367) that tell us he doesn't need to follow\
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2369) any logic any rules and regulations\
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2371) because i'm giving an example here if\
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2374) you look at the incident\
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2376) of the moon splitting in the lifetime of\
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2379) prophet muhammad\
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2381) what does that tell you that god doesn't\
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2383) really need\
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2384) to follow any rules in regulation what\
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2386) are miracles miracles are those\
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2388) exceptions\
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2389) so why does god need\
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2392) do not show any miracle when it comes to\
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2394) being at three places at once\
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2396) and three forms at once okay so the prob\
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2399) the problem is not\
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2400) sir the problem is not that god exists\
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2403) at\
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2403) as three forms in three different places\
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2406) at once that's not the problem\
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2408) let me let me get down to what i think\
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2411) the real issue\
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2412) is you mentioned earlier when you first\
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2414) started talking you said\
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2415) each one of these three things are parts\
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2419) okay now that's for me\
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2422) already you're starting out with\
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2423) problematic language\
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2425) do you think that each one of the\
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2427) persons are a third\
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2428) or a part of god or are they each fully\
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2431) god\
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2433) they're all fully god okay then why'd\
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2435) you say parts\
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2437) they are god for you and i to understand\
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2441) three different versions of something\
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2443) right now that is equally powerful\
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2446) well okay i'll say versions i'll not say\
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2448) parts anymore then\
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2450) how does that sound to you okay so three\
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2452) different versions\
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2454) so each one of them are the same being\
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2456) right\
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2457) yeah okay so three different realms\
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2461) okay so the father and the son are the\
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2462) same god but different\
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2464) persons would you say that no no they're\
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2467) the same thing\
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2468) right and they do have similar\
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2471) properties that we\
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2473) you and i would comprehend right to\
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2476) teach us something else\
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2478) but they're the same people they're the\
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2480) same god\
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2481) okay but do they have any properties\
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2483) that are different\
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2484) from one another it doesn't really\
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2487) matter what properties they have\
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2489) they're just in three forms and three\
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2491) versions\
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2492) it does it does because it doesn't\
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2495) really matter\
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2496) well i'm explaining to you i'm gonna\
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2498) explain to you why it does matter\
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2499) because\
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2500) saying this in logic implies what's\
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2503) called\
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2503) numerical identity so if you're\
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2505) comparing what are two things\
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2508) and you say that they're the same thing\
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2510) meaning that they're the same god\
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2512) and yet they differ in their properties\
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2514) they can't be the same god\
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2516) but different persons that's the whole\
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2518) problem\
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2520) i'm not saying they're different in\
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2521) their properties okay so they're\
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2523) so the father and son don't differ in\
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2526) any way\
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2526) in any properties they're the same they\
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2530) just\
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2530) are apparently different to you and i to\
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2532) make you and i understand\
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2534) what it is like to be divine what it's\
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2537) like to be\
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2538) human and what it's like to be something\
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2540) in between\
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2541) did the sun die on the cross or did the\
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2543) father\
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2544) it's not about that it's about the\
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2546) apparent thing that is made apparent to\
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2548) you\
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2549) people do believe god cannot die it was\
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2552) made to look like\
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2553) no no no no no no that's not what you\
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2554) and i it's not my point is i'm trying to\
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2557) point out\
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2558) that you as a christian by the bible\
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2561) itself as a faithful christian\
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2563) that's not necessary i need to follow\
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2564) 100 of bible\
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2566) yes but you what you have to say is you\
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2568) have to say\
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2569) that there are properties that\
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2571) distinguish amongst the father the son\
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2573) and the holy spirit\
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2574) otherwise you run the risk of modalism\
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2577) of collapsing\
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2578) the persons and them all being exactly\
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2580) the same thing\
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2581) that's not it's only based on the logic\
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2584) that\
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2585) the human mind is constructed the human\
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2587) construct\
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2588) is something else the divine construct\
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2590) is something else\
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2591) you don't think there's anything\
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2592) different between the father and the son\
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2594) nothing not inherently but apparently\
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2598) for you and i\
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2599) i it might be so when jesus said only\
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2602) the father\
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2603) knows the hour and he made it explicitly\
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2606) about this one person of the trinity\
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2610) you know from jesus's own mouth there\
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2612) there is a quality how do you know that\
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2614) it's from his own mouth do you believe\
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2618) do you have as you have the if hadith\
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2621) hadith why can bible not be the even\
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2624) model\
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2624) i thought you just said you have to\
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2626) believe a hundred percent of the bible\
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2628) i didn't say that i'll challenge you so\
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2631) what's your position on the bible you\
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2632) don't have to believe in that it doesn't\
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2634) it doesn't really concern anyone what i\
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2635) say about the bible but what i'm trying\
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2637) to say is\
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2638) we're we're dealing with you we only can\
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2640) deal with your personal beliefs we can't\
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2642) deal with somebody so\
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2643) if you're a muslim are you supposed to\
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2645) be believing in quran and hadith\
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2647) completely blindly\
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2649) what the quran is so we believe\
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2653) we believe that the quran is the word of\
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2654) god\
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2656) how do you know that we don't believe\
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2658) there's anything\
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2659) weak in the quran what about\
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2663) christ\
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2669) there are even logical fallacies in the\
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2671) quran hold on a second sir\
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2672) you're you're going on to other points\
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2675) that are not related\
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2676) i'm not i'm trying to make a point that\
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2679) your presumptions\
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2680) are not right you can't have\
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2683) presumptions about the trinity have\
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2685) nothing to do with the quran you can't\
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2688) you can't\
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2688) have one set of rules for allah and the\
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2691) other set of rules for the christians\
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2694) what is this rule specifically that\
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2695) you're saying that we're holding uh\
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2697) differently for the quran\
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2698) there are no rules that's what i'm\
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2699) trying to say but what you're trying to\
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2700) do is you're saying\
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2702) there is a logical fallacy that god\
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2704) cannot be\
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2705) the god the son and the holy spirit i\
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2707) say yes he can\
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2709) no nothing stops him your rule of\
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2711) numerical identity and all that it\
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2713) doesn't really concern god it doesn't\
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2715) really matter\
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2716) okay we're not gonna\
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2720) so god can break in his own being he can\
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2723) break\
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2724) all the rules of logic the law of\
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2726) non-contradiction\
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2727) excluded middle and law of identity\
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2729) anything he cannot be evil\
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2731) can god be evil he can create them he\
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2734) created them\
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2735) can god be evil aye\
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2738) he can't so who who who did who did god\
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2741) create sorry who did god create you\
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2743) mentioned\
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2744) the rules the universe all right so\
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2746) you've got to create the universe\
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2748) so what is there anything is there\
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2750) anything that distinguishes\
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2752) therefore your theology to let's say\
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2756) uh polytheism so if somebody turns\
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2758) around and says well i'm a polytheist\
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2761) and i believe that god can exist\
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2764) in multiple beings of gods there is a\
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2767) zeus there is the thor whatever it is\
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2769) and if somebody turns around and says\
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2771) well that apparently goes against\
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2773) rationality you'd say well yeah but they\
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2775) live in a different realm where they can\
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2777) be both\
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2778) god and multiple beings at the same time\
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2781) with\
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2781) without feelings they can say that they\
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2783) can't have any problem with that\
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2785) i've got no problem with that but when\
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2787) it comes to zeus\
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2789) yeah when it comes to zeus and poseidon\
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2791) and thor\
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2792) right those people they didn't really\
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2794) actually claim to be the almighty god\
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2797) they created no no i'm just giving that\
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2799) as an example\
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2800) as you're right of course i\
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2804) have no problem with that right okay so\
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2807) you don't have to\
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2808) important yeah oh do you have a problem\
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2812) do you have a problem or do you have an\
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2814) issue where\
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2815) there is something you cannot say about\
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2817) god\
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2819) because it would be irrational do you\
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2820) mean that is there anything exactly\
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2823) about god\
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2824) yeah you say it's logically impossible\
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2827) can we just say whatever we want\
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2842) i'm just giving them freedom he can\
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2844) literally do whatever he wants\
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2846) so can god cease to cease to exist\
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2850) right can god cease to exist\
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2853) right now he can but how does that\
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2856) existence really matter\
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2857) how does that can he he can that's what\
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2860) i'm saying yes he can so god can cease\
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2862) to exist\
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2864) right you're making god not a necessary\
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2866) existence you're making him a possible\
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2868) are you making him unnecessary existence\
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2870) by your logic but no no\
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2872) it's not it's by the words of god\
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2875) himself\
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2876) he refers to himself oh do you know have\
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2878) you speak have you spoken to god how do\
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2880) you know what does he say he's a\
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2881) necessary being\
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2882) oh have you spoken to god\
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2890) here is that we can't really make any\
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2892) headway in this discussion because if\
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2893) you're saying that\
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2894) you know we can say whatever we want\
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2896) about god and god doesn't\
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2898) have to you know adhere to our you know\
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2900) uh um\
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2902) you know way of reasoning even though he\
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2905) created our\
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2905) reason and our logic then basically\
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2908) anyone can say that they believe\
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2909) anything about god\
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2910) anyone can make any kind of religious\
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2912) claims and we really\
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2914) have no lake to stand on to try to\
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2916) critique their religion and then\
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2917) therefore there's no really there's no\
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2919) real difference between truth and\
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2920) falsehood\
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2921) so any critique you launch against islam\
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2923) i'll just tell you well you know what\
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2924) it's just god any critique i launch\
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2926) against christianity well you know what\
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2927) it's god\
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2928) and we could just end the discussion\
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2930) isn't that how islam goes\
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2934) it's what you're doing right now if it's\
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2936) how islam goes then\
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2937) i find that problematic but it's what\
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2939) you're doing right now what you're\
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2940) basically saying is that you can\
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2942) literally say anything about god\
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2944) it can be apart from what we say apart\
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2946) from what we say\
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2947) you can have incoherent beliefs and i\
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2949) literally cannot launch\
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2950) a rational attack or critique on your\
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2953) belief\
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2954) because you can why are you limiting god\
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2956) why are you limiting god in any way\
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2958) we're not limiting when you what is\
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2961) illogical what is illogical according to\
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2963) you\
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2963) for god when you said when you said for\
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2966) example why do you believe that\
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2967) god's a necessary being well firstly we\
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2970) don't presuppose a religious\
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2971) text what we do is we try to look at the\
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2974) reality around us and fusion that's\
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2977) philosophy not reality\
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2978) using using using the rational mind\
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2981) come to certain conclusions the fact\
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2984) that contingent beings\
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2986) the eye things that are not necessary in\
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2987) their existence\
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2989) require necessary foundation please\
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2992) necessarily be well you know you can say\
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2995) it's it's philosophy\
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2996) but the thing is is that everything that\
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=2998) we make a decision about which we\
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3000) believe is important in life for example\
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3002) if i go to the doctor\
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3004) and i say to the doctor you know i've\
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3006) got this and this\
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3007) symptoms and if i think that the doctor\
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3009) just closes his eyes and feels\
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3011) what he feels in his heart as the answer\
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3014) and then tells me to take ex-medicine\
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3016) or whatever it is because he just felt\
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3018) it in his heart i wouldn't trust him\
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3021) i would want a person to undertake some\
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3023) rational\
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3024) intellectual approach in order to give\
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3027) me a decision about what my medical\
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3029) condition is\
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3030) similarly if i'm walking across the road\
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3032) i'm going to look both ways and i'm\
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3033) going to judge using my mind\
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3035) if there's any vehicles going past\
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3037) because that's how we operate\
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3039) now when we're talking about the issue\
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3040) of salvation about\
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3042) guidance from god suddenly we don't you\
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3045) know\
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3046) leave religion out of it you know\
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3048) thinking process and rationality out of\
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3050) it\
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3051) you know and just say anything goes\
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3053) rather this is like the most fundamental\
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3055) question to human existence what is our\
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3057) purpose\
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3058) how do we understand belief in a creator\
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3060) does a creator exist\
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3062) therefore it requires an intellectual\
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3065) process\
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3066) you know so it's very difficult to argue\
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3068) that you have to\
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3069) abandon an intellectual process when it\
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3071) comes to quote-unquote religious\
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3073) claims yeah guidance from god but use it\
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3077) in every other aspect of our life i just\
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3079) i don't think that's i but at the end of\
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3081) the day i think there is an impasse in\
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3083) essence because you're saying that we\
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3084) can't use rationality at all\
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3086) there's just a relationship we can't use\
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3088) rationality see this is the problem\
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3090) you're not trying to understand what i'm\
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3091) saying\
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3092) i'm saying you cannot bound god by any\
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3096) rules but you're bounding him by the\
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3098) rule that he can do\
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3100) whatever he wants even if it's\
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3102) completely so how is that bounding him\
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3103) by rules\
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3105) let's try this let's try this if i tell\
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3106) you like\
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3108) if i if i let's just grant that like\
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3110) let's say that trinity is is not\
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3112) incoherent let's say it's a logical\
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3113) possibility right\
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3115) uh i'm not saying it's a logical\
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3117) possibility sorry\
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3118) okay okay okay it's a possibility okay\
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3121) so let's say it's a possibility let's\
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3122) say it's a possibility\
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3124) let's just right now for the sake of\
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3126) argument say that's the case\
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3127) uh isn't there a difference between\
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3129) ontology and epistemology so let's say\
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3132) it is possible that there\
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3133) is a flying spaghetti monster living\
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3136) behind the moon\
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3137) there's a difference between that if it\
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3139) is indeed an ontological reality and\
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3141) between the epistemology through which i\
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3143) reach\
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3144) reasonable belief about that fact so if\
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3147) it is the case that it is possible that\
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3149) there is a flying spaghetti monster\
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3151) living behind the moon\
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3152) that doesn't mean that i am justified in\
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3154) believing believing that there is indeed\
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3157) a flying spaghetti monster behind the\
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3158) moon i guess what i'm saying here is\
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3160) that there's a difference between even\
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3161) if you're gonna just open it all up and\
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3162) say you know\
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3163) anything is possible for god there's a\
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3165) difference between that\
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3167) you know and and muslims we have we have\
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3170) we have an understanding that god\
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3171) isn't fully comprehensible as well right\
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3174) god is not conceivable we don't say he's\
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3176) illogical\
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3176) he's not conceivable but that doesn't\
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3178) mean that we can believe\
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3180) illogical things about him so there's a\
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3182) difference between the epistemology\
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3184) that you use to derive beliefs about god\
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3187) or to justify your beliefs about god\
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3189) and between ontology and you saying that\
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3191) you know what it's possible for this you\
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3193) know\
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3194) weird counter-intuitive thing to exist\
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3196) in some possible world\
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3198) those are two different things so what\
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3200) makes i think we're concerned with the\
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3201) epistemological point here\
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3202) we're also concerned with like the\
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3204) metaphysics but i don't think you're\
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3205) really concerned with that\
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3207) so let's let's talk about the\
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3208) epistemology what justifies your belief\
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3211) in these apparently counter-intuitive\
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3214) and and uh from a human perspective\
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3218) not very likely or plausible thing about\
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3221) god\
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3223) so you think my beliefs as they call it\
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3225) right my beliefs are incoherent\
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3228) with the human understanding of the\
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3229) universe right do you think god is\
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3231) physical\
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3235) he asked a question sorry about he asked\
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3237) the question\
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3238) what justifies your conception of god\
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3244) okay so are you a trinitarian if i can\
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3246) if i can ask\
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3248) how does that matter if i'm okay if i'm\
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3251) asked a different question\
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3252) i know what you're trying to say no no\
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3253) you're not you're not no no no you\
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3255) didn't let me finish\
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3256) all right camden camden what i'm saying\
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3258) is how does it matter to the question\
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3261) like calm down it doesn't matter to the\
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3263) question what i'm trying to answer right\
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3264) now\
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3265) i the discussion is about trinity right\
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3267) obviously i'm not talking about that\
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3268) right now\
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3269) what i'm saying is how does it matter if\
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3271) i say for me\
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3273) god is not bound by anything god is free\
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3281) the issue is well the the you're\
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3284) you're quite happy to say that like the\
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3286) hindus can\
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3288) you're sort of like including hindu\
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3290) thought in there and like god could be a\
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3292) million what's\
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3292) to stop him from being a million person\
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3294) so how can we say that hinduism is\
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3296) incoherent\
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3297) um but what we say is wrong so everyone\
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3301) is\
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3301) allowed to say whatever we want but\
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3304) whatever we've said\
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3311) could we be visibly right there\
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3314) i'm not saying you're wrong what i'm\
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3316) trying to do is could we why are you\
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3318) limiting god why are you limiting god\
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3321) it's not limiting\
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3322) anything because the language god says\
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3325) in the bible\
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3326) god says in the bible that he cannot lie\
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3329) that he cannot deny himself are you\
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3331) familiar with these scriptures no he\
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3333) can't\
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3334) okay he won't what is what does hebrews\
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3336) 6 18\
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3337) say well if you talk about bible and\
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3340) hebrews and all that right what i'm\
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3342) asking you is\
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3343) if quran says what does that mean\
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3346) we're talking about we're talking about\
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3348) the bible even and your concept of god\
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3350) that's the same thing that i'm trying to\
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3352) say\
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3353) yeah but when we say when we say when we\
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3355) say god can do\
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3356) all things yeah we don't say that he can\
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3359) do\
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3360) logically impossible things like cease\
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3362) to exist\
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3363) we say where does it say we separate\
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3366) we separate for example we separate\
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3368) three things isn't it free propositions\
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3370) yeah propositional statements\
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3372) logically necessary which means has to\
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3375) be\
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3376) logically possible which means could be\
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3378) and logically impossible which\
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3380) can't be yeah so we we have these three\
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3383) propositions\
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3384) now here's the prop here's the point is\
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3386) that in the quran\
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3387) it says that god is a summoned\
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3390) yeah self-sufficient independent then\
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3393) you've got another verse that turns\
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3395) around and says\
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3396) that there is no that god can do all\
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3398) things yeah\
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3399) now how do you how do you then uh you\
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3402) know\
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3403) uh reconcile the conflict if a person\
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3406) then says\
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3407) well can not god cease to to exist\
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3411) can god cause himself to die yeah\
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3413) because that would\
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3414) contradict a sayety i assumed in\
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3417) self-sufficiency\
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3418) and according to you if you take this\
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3421) verse shape to mean all\
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3423) logical possible logically impossible\
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3425) things as well\
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3427) including this premise of god dying\
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3430) that wouldn't make any sense so the idea\
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3432) would be is that\
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3433) actually when it means shay thing here\
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3436) it means all logical possible things\
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3439) that's how muslims reconcile it\
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3441) and uh this is it\
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3445) if you if you want to know the tafsir\
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3447) i'll tell you the tafsir at the end yeah\
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3448) we'll put it in the chat\
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3450) for you also among the sahaja yogis it's\
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3454) a very common christian understanding of\
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3456) omnipotence it's not\
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3457) i mean it doesn't really matter\
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3461) it means that he can you actually\
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3463) although you are you actually a\
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3464) christian or you just be\
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3465) playing devil what do you think by now\
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3467) what do you think\
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3469) like a traditional christian right\
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3472) okay i'm not a traditional christian\
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3475) right right right so\
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3476) we're gonna need to we're gonna need to\
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3478) close this soon i mean we\
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3479) we appreciate having you on and the\
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3481) discussion was\
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3483) was fun although not very fruitful but\
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3485) um\
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3486) but if you could just very briefly go\
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3488) back to that question i asked you let's\
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3490) just say everything is possible for the\
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3492) sake of argument because\
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3493) in order to convince you otherwise that\
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3494) that's that's like an uh\
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3496) an entirely different project but let's\
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3498) say everything is possible\
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3500) what justifies you in believing specific\
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3503) possible things right like there are\
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3505) things even if everything is possible\
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3507) the the spaghetti monster analogy i gave\
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3509) you\
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3510) that's possible what would justify me in\
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3512) believing such a thing so\
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3514) taking that back to the trinity what\
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3516) would justify you in believing in that\
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3519) is it the mere fact that it's a logical\
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3521) possibility\
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3523) well no it's not just that because i'm\
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3525) not limiting god\
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3526) to existing in one form or the other\
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3529) right what i'm trying to say is god is\
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3531) not limited\
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3532) that is the basic premise let's say i\
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3535) agree with you for the sake of argument\
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3537) that that because i don't think it's a\
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3539) limitation first of all i think there\
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3540) are things\
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3541) like if you say god can become a frog or\
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3544) whatever i mean or god can stop being\
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3546) god\
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3546) that's not you i think that's the\
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3548) limitation when we talk about not\
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3550) limiting god we're talking about like\
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3552) when you're talking about omnipotence\
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3553) you're talking about like a great making\
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3556) property\
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3556) so you don't say god for example can lie\
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3558) because he's omnipotent\
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3560) but putting that aside let's say i agree\
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3562) with you that god can do everything i'm\
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3563) being very generous here\
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3564) let's say the trinity isn't logically\
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3566) incoherent how do you bridge the gap\
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3568) between something being a mere\
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3570) possibility to something being actually\
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3573) plausible\
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3574) and a reasonable rational belief\
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3578) the same way that you can believe that\
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3580) moon was split into two\
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3582) by no matter there's nothing logically\
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3584) incoherent\
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3598) one plausible explanation of how moon\
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3601) can be split into two\
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3602) no no no no what do you mean that's a\
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3604) difficult project because you need to\
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3606) understand that the laws of nature are\
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3607) contingent i don't think you understand\
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3608) that do you understand\
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3609) the world i don't\
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3613) contingent understand that's what you're\
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3614) trying to say and then you're telling me\
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3616) the moon was split into the building\
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3617) otherwise is it logically terrible tell\
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3620) me what is it\
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3622) tell me specifically what it is about\
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3624) the moon splitting that is contradictory\
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3626) tell me how does it happen what is the\
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3628) logical explanation for it\
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3630) we don't need one based on your\
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3632) explanation of\
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3633) your based on my see that there that is\
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3635) the problem\
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3636) now imagine i just joined the call i\
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3639) didn't tell you any of the things i told\
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3641) you i'm doing that\
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3642) i'm doing that to show the absurdity in\
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3646) what you're saying\
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3647) that's the whole point i'm absurd you're\
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3649) the one who believes in a flying donkey\
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3669) saying that i'm asking you if there can\
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3670) be a flying donkey\
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3672) yeah yeah that can be flying down yeah\
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3675) yeah\
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3675) of course of course that can be of\
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3677) course your book says that so\
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3679) so no finish my point let me finish my\
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3682) points\
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3683) when i turned around and i talked about\
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3685) these three propositions yeah logically\
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3687) necessary logically possible logically\
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3690) impossible i don't think you've\
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3691) understood\
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3692) what these mean yeah so for example we\
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3695) know practically\
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3696) you can't travel at the speed of light\
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3699) yeah so practically\
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3700) that's impossible as we'd call it but\
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3704) that's not what we would consider or\
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3707) call a logical\
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3708) impossibility that's still in the realms\
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3711) of logically possible\
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3713) yeah because when we're talking about\
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3715) contingent realities or even what we\
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3717) call laws of nature\
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3719) we're talking about things that we've\
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3720) arrived at through induction\
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3722) which could have been otherwise yeah so\
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3725) therefore anything that we consider\
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3728) a miracle we're not calling logically\
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3730) impossible things that have occurred\
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3732) what we're saying is that they still\
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3734) within the realms of logical possibility\
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3737) even though they're beyond human\
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3739) productive capacity\
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3740) and so as a result god has the ability\
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3744) to undertake certain actions like\
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3746) raising people from the dead\
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3748) even though that's physically impossible\
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3750) for human beings but it's not\
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3751) logically impossible now that's a\
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3754) different\
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3755) category abu to talking about more than\
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3758) one god\
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3759) or god ceasing to exist this category\
[1:02:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3763) is called a logical impossibility\
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3766) yeah or when we say god has to be a\
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3769) necessary being\
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3770) we're saying this category or this\
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3772) propositional statement\
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3773) means that it is logically necessary\
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3776) for god to be a necessary being yeah so\
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3779) you need to separate what we mean by\
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3781) logical possible logical necessary\
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3783) logical impossible\
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3785) in this discussion you're not familiar\
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3787) with this particular terminology\
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3789) and so you're you're mixing two\
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3792) different things\
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3794) together yeah now going back to what\
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3796) abdul rahman said\
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3798) abdul rahman asked you why do you\
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3800) justify\
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3801) your particular belief in conception in\
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3803) god as opposed to other conceptions and\
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3805) beliefs in god\
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3810) um i i i think we've got guests waiting\
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3813) so uh\

[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3852) your non-denominational or\
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3854) just give us a bit of info on uh where\
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3856) you stand with regards to\
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3858) christianity yeah yeah i'm an oriental\
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3860) orthodox christian so i'm part of the\
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3861) what's called the oriental orthodox\
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3863) church one of the three apostolic\
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3864) churches and i believe in the\
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3867) actual trinity i don't know what that\
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3869) stuff was that we just heard for the\
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3871) past uh 45 minutes but that was\
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3873) uh scary i can assure you that that's\
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3876) not the trinity that's\
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3878) some type of uh hindu nonsense or\
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3881) something\
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3881) i don't know i don't know where he got\
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3884) those ideas from\
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3885) i think he's uh an independent thinker\
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3887) so i don't think he's\
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3888) um i think he's he's not\
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3891) limiting himself as much as he's trying\
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3893) not to to limit god\
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3895) yeah yeah yeah so um\
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3898) with regards to the were you here when\
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3900) we gave um\
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3902) forward the idea of the trinity as we\
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3904) understood it\
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3905) um did you feel like that first part was\
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3907) fair and then um\
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3909) is there anything you would like to say\
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3910) with regards to the particular critiques\
[1:05:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3913) uh we gave yeah i listened for\
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3916) just a short moment i will say that\
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3920) um i'll say your objections are based\
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3923) forgive me but your objection\
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3924) are based on some misconceptions about\
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3926) what we actually believe\
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3928) uh when we say trinity we believe that\
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3929) these three are one we believe that\
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3932) each of the hypostases and god are of\
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3934) course fully god i think you\
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3936) mentioned that um i would of course\
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3939) disagree that that it's illogical we can\
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3941) get into that if you'd like\
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3942) and we believe that these three\
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3943) hypostases are each identical to god's\
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3946) essence\
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3947) identical to god's essence but distinct\
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3949) from each other\
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3950) and so they're not different between\
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3952) each other there's not something in who\
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3954) we call the father\
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3956) that is not in who we call the son and\
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3958) there's only one who\
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3960) there aren't three who's we believe\
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3962) three hypostases each identical\
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3964) to the essence distinct to each other by\
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3966) relation\
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3967) and that one simply comes from the other\
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3970) and another comes from\
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3972) both in a sense but they're identical in\
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3975) essence\
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3976) and there aren't three essences uh\
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3978) there's one essence\
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3980) there's one knowledge one will one uh\
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3983) you could say\
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3984) set of attributes uh and we can say that\
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3987) in many different senses so to say the\
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3989) least\
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3990) that's what we believe we can get into\
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3991) it if you like yeah so when you say\
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3993) one knowledge um but then in\
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3997) the by i've already made mention to this\
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=3998) um so what are your thoughts with\
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4000) regards to the quote where jesus\
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4002) where he makes the claim that only god\
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4004) knows the hour\
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4005) which suggests a distinction in\
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4007) knowledge as well\
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4010) by just a surface level interpretation\
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4012) it seems that that's what he's saying\
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4013) that he\
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4014) he actually does lack the knowledge uh\
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4016) but we\
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4017) have to make sure that we read the\
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4019) scriptures through a certain lens and so\
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4020) we believe as\
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4021) orthodox christians and even catholics\
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4023) believe this uh that that is an\
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4025) allegorical passage\
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4026) so what christ is really saying there is\
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4028) something much deeper\
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4029) and it's actually a verse about the\
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4031) trinity the verse about the father we\
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4033) call the father\
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4035) causing his son to be or i should say uh\
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4039) it's it's talking about the begetting of\
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4041) the sun or of the logos\
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4043) um in that it's not that the sun doesn't\
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4047) know that he doesn't have the knowledge\
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4049) but it's that\
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4050) the father is the first cause and he has\
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4053) the knowledge not of himself but\
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4055) by the father causing him to be it's\
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4057) kind of complicated we can get into it\
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4058) though\
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4059) it has to do with the concept of the\
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4060) logos in short so\
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4062) we do have ancient uh you know which you\
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4065) would call taft seers of this\
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4067) of this uh verse mark 13 32 matthew 24\
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4070) 36\
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4071) yeah so so earlier when you were\
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4074) explaining the trinity you\
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4076) can you just go over that again because\
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4078) i was a bit confused about what you said\
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4081) sure so in short we believe that\
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4084) god is one we believe in one god one\
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4086) consciousness\
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4088) we believe that there is god in god's\
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4091) logos\
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4092) okay there's the self in god the very\
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4095) true god\
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4097) and there is his knowledge of himself\
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4100) and god and his knowledge are really\
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4103) distinct\
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4104) though his knowledge is fully his\
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4106) essence\
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4108) and so god he beholds himself\
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4111) infinitely perfectly absolutely because\
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4113) he is all-knowing\
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4115) his entire being is also in his\
[1:08:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4117) knowledge\
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4118) and we call this a second hypostasis a\
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4120) second underlying reality within god\
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4123) and we see that this knower and the\
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4126) thing that is known of himself\
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4128) are identical in essence it's as if you\
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4131) know god's looking into a mirror and\
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4132) sees his entire being in the mirror\
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4136) the image in the mirror of course is\
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4137) caused by the one who bears the image\
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4140) and the it's the exact image in this\
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4142) analogy the physical analogy is not the\
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4144) best\
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4145) but he's called the logos because he is\
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4147) the the thought which be\
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4148) is begotten of the mind of god in\
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4151) ancient platonic thought you know this\
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4152) is what logos meant\
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4154) uh all of our church fathers say the\
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4155) same thing the early church fathers and\
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4157) of course we still teach this today\
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4159) that the logos is the exact image of the\
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4162) father's hypostasis\
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4163) even according to the scriptures that's\
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4165) hebrews 1 3.\
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4166) and we have many many many allegorical\
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4168) passages and some straightforward\
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4170) passages\
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4171) alluding to this truth not so\
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4175) if that makes it are the father and the\
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4177) son the same god\
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4180) yes are they different persons\
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4183) uh different hypostases yeah okay so how\
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4186) can you explain how can they be\
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4189) the same god but different persons\
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4191) because that uh\
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4193) classically understood that violates the\
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4195) law of identity\
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4198) so when we say i personally i avoid the\
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4201) word persons\
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4202) in english because people when we hear\
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4204) when we say persons they think of\
[1:10:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4205) maybe you and and i they think of three\
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4208) different people or something\
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4210) they think of uh you know the father\
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4211) talking to someone called the son\
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4214) and somehow they're different beings but\
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4217) the same being\
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4218) obviously that would violate the law of\
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4220) not a contradiction\
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4221) uh you can't have two beings and one\
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4223) being uh so i prefer the word hypostasis\
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4226) it's used in the scriptures it's used in\
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4227) the church father writings\
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4229) no hypothesis is fine but it doesn't\
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4231) really matter if you what which term you\
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4233) use because\
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4235) the claim the claim is that if you are\
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4237) saying\
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4238) uh for example if you say that these two\
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4241) things\
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4242) are the same type of thing which is god\
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4244) but they're a different type of thing\
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4247) hypostasis or person and we would say in\
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4250) english\
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4250) okay how do you actually bridge the gap\
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4254) and explain\
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4254) how they can be the same type of thing\
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4257) which is god\
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4258) but a different type of thing person do\
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4260) you understand\
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4261) how that violates the law of identity or\
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4265) not\
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4265) no no because they're the same in tur\
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4268) in regards to essence they are distinct\
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4273) uh when it comes to the hypostases and\
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4274) we see that both hypostases must exist\
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4277) and that one exists because of the other\
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4279) so once again\
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4280) there is god now let's all imagine this\
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4283) no pun intended\
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4284) god he imagines himself in his mind\
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4288) okay he has infinite knowledge he knows\
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4290) everything entirely\
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4291) and and holy and so when he contemplates\
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4295) himself\
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4297) his entire being is in the image in his\
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4301) mind\
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4302) because he knows all things perfectly he\
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4304) knows himself wholly and perfectly\
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4307) so his the image in his mind is an exact\
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4310) copy of the self\
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4314) we call this the self image or the logos\
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4317) so once again god's entire self is\
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4320) in the image in his mind but the self\
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4324) and the self image are distinct not by\
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4327) substance\
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4328) because everything his substance is is\
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4331) in the image\
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4332) because he is all-knowing and we see\
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4334) here that even the self-image must exist\
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4336) because it's\
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4337) of course necessary that god knows\
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4339) himself\
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4340) and it's necessary that god is infinite\
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4342) in knowledge and therefore knows his\
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4343) entire self\
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4345) yeah i mean we're get we're going on a\
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4347) bit the point is that when you say that\
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4349) x is the same f as y\
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4353) you're actually saying that the two\
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4355) things are identical\
[1:12:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4357) identical in essence but we see that\
[1:12:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4359) identical\
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4360) identical in terms of numerical identity\
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4365) in that they are the two are one and are\
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4367) one god\
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4368) yeah but we see that the knower and the\
[1:12:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4370) known\
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4371) are distinct would you agree no what i'm\
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4374) trying to explain to you is that\
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4376) in logic when you say that two things\
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4379) are the same\
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4380) type of thing that implies that they are\
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4382) identical to one another\
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4384) and cannot be differed they cannot have\
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4387) anything different about them in any\
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4389) properties whatsoever\
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4392) you cannot have want two things that are\
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4395) the same type of thing\
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4396) but a different other type of thing\
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4400) i mean that's why we say they're not\
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4401) different they're distinct\
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4404) there's no difference between father and\
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4405) son there's a distinction\
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4407) this is a real distinction they have\
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4409) different properties\
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4411) no we we believe there's one set of\
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4413) properties in god that is\
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4414) his essence we believe in only one\
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4417) one existence of god there is not\
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4420) i mean you can say that one has\
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4422) conceptual properties but there's not\
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4424) real properties there's not something in\
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4426) who we call god in something\
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4428) else in who we call the logos is the\
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4430) father\
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4431) identity is the father unbegotten\
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4434) the father is unbegotten yes is the son\
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4437) unbegotten\
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4439) no the the sun has begotten right\
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4441) because they have they have a difference\
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4443) about them\
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4444) they're not exactly the same but the\
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4446) distinction is by relation\
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4448) and that one comes from the other we're\
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4450) not going to look at what we call the\
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4451) sun you know\
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4452) in in theory let's say we were able to\
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4454) see god\
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4455) uh god forbid but we can't look into who\
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4458) we call the logos and say look there's a\
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4460) property right there that we can't see\
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4462) in this other hypostasis\
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4464) because the logos is merely the self\
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4466) it's the\
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4467) it's the self-image it's the perfect\
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4469) image of the first hypostasis\
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4472) yeah but unbegottenness is not a\
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4474) property that can be shared\
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4476) let me begin yes but when i'm i'm saying\
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4479) it's not a real\
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4481) property do you get what i'm saying it's\
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4482) not an actual thing which is really\
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4484) distinct from the essence\
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4486) it is because it's it's either a part\
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4489) it's either a part of the essence\
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4490) or it's part of the person okay\
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4494) let's get into it's a property it's a\
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4496) property of the person of the father\
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4500) it's not a real property a real thing\
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4503) which is really distinct from the\
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4504) essence though\
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4505) we i mean i'm sure you would admit that\
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4507) god must know his\
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4509) self he must have an image of himself in\
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4512) his mind\
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4513) well it has to either be a property of\
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4515) the essence or it's not and if it's not\
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4517) then what is that property of\
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4519) you're saying it's not a property\
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4520) whatsoever we would say\
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4522) we believe in something called divine\
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4524) simplicity that you know god has not\
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4525) composed the parts\
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4526) that whatever prophet properties we can\
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4528) attribute to god are his essence\
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4531) we don't think there's a real\
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4532) distinction between god's knowledge\
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4536) god's love god's power and likewise\
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4538) we're not going to say that there's\
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4539) something in god called\
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4540) unbegottenness begottenness and\
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4543) procession\
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4544) yeah but are the persons identical to\
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4546) the essence\
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4547) the persons are identical to the essence\
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4549) yes okay so are the persons identical\
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4552) to one another in essence\
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4555) okay so look now you're making a\
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4558) clarification when i say\
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4559) are the persons identical to the essence\
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4562) you're saying\
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4563) yes meaning that they're the exact same\
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4566) thing as the essence\
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4567) but then when i ask if they're identical\
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4569) to one another you're not giving a clear\
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4571) yes answer so that shows that there's\
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4574) something different\
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4575) between the two persons you're you're\
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4577) saying these two things\
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4579) are identical to this one other thing\
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4581) which is the essence\
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4582) that implies that if those two things\
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4584) are identical to that other\
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4586) thing which is the essence they have to\
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4588) be identical to one another\
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4590) and you can't say that that's the whole\
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4592) problem\
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4594) i mean they're distinct in hypoce this\
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4596) is part of the mystery of the trinity of\
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4597) course but we see how it must be the\
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4598) case\
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4600) and you know we're talking about whether\
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4601) or not the trinity makes sense right of\
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4603) course\
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4604) right we can see this cannot be\
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4606) polytheism obviously it's it's one god\
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4608) since you think the three are identical\
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4610) even in hypostasis it's it's one god\
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4612) this is the christian\
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4613) teaching on the trinity first off but\
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4616) would you agree\
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4617) that well i guess i have a question for\
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4620) you do you believe in divine simplicity\
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4622) or\
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4623) or what is your school of thought in in\
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4624) islam are you uh\
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4626) no no we don't we don't believe in\
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4630) divine simplicity but\
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4631) before we get into that we want to stick\
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4635) on this point point because you said\
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4636) well\
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4637) when i when i made that point and i\
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4639) think you understood it you said well\
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4641) at this point sort of the the trinity is\
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4642) a mystery which\
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4644) i can understand what you're saying but\
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4646) i want to make clear\
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4648) that you and the audience understood the\
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4651) point that i was trying to make\
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4653) and give you a chance to resolve that\
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4656) apparent problem if you don't think you\
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4658) can and that at that point\
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4660) it's where you have to say it's a\
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4661) mystery that's fine i'm not\
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4663) like disrespecting you but i just want\
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4666) to understand that that's what you're\
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4667) saying\
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4669) i mean it's we can see how this must be\
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4672) the case and of course god has revealed\
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4674) to us that this is the case that he's a\
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4675) trinity as to how\
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4678) it is that his nature exists in this way\
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4681) you know i i'm not sure\
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4683) uh but we can just kind of look at\
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4686) everything and say well\
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4687) yeah there's god and there's god's\
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4690) self-knowledge and these are really\
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4692) distinct\
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4694) would you agree with that so far there's\
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4696) god and there's god's knowledge and\
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4697) these are really distinct\
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4698) under and i don't know if jake wants to\
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4700) so you don't mind me jumping into you\
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4701) jake\
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4702) uh no go ahead i don't mind no i was\
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4704) gonna say and because you\
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4706) mentioned that you believe in divine\
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4707) simplicity\
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4709) now under the doctrine of divine\
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4710) simplicity\
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4712) the attributes or the persons\
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4715) would have to be identical to the\
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4717) essence and each property would have to\
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4720) be identical to each other property\
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4722) you couldn't distinguish any of them\
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4725) well yeah but these aren't real\
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4727) properties\
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4728) these are human concepts that we add\
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4730) tribute to god that's what we call them\
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4731) attributes\
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4732) yeah but what about what is god he's\
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4734) above these things the persons are not\
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4736) just\
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4736) human constructs they're right yeah\
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4738) these are real things\
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4740) so if these three persons are real\
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4743) things\
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4743) and they're distinct they cannot be\
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4746) identical to one another\
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4747)Music
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4749) they can be identical in essence as i've\
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4751) shown that\
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4752) god if he beholds himself in his mind\
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4756) in what we call the logos the logos must\
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4759) be an exact\
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4761) image if there's anything less in the\
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4763) logos then god does not know his entire\
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4765) self\
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4766) if there's anything more than the logos\
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4769) then once again god does not\
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4771) have a perfect image of himself in his\
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4773) mind meaning he's not all-knowing\
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4775) but if he is all-knowing and if his\
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4777) knowledge is perfect\
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4779) the logos must be the exact image of the\
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4783) father's hypostasis as the scripture\
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4784) says and as saint paul said\
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4786) yeah but let me explain something to you\
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4788) about how identity works\
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4790) so you before you said that the two part\
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4793) the the\
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4794) let's just take the father and the son\
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4795) the father and the son\
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4797) are identical to the essence of god this\
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4800) is what your claim was\
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4801) now if in in logic if\
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4804) a is identical to b and\
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4808) b is identical to c then it follows\
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4811) logically that a\
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4812) is identical to c so if you're comparing\
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4815) these two things which is the father and\
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4817) the son and you're saying that they are\
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4820) identical to the essence then it follows\
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4823) logically that the father and the son\
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4826) are identical to one another which is\
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4828) the very same thing that you\
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4830) or an orthodox christian would want to\
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4832) deny\
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4833) so that's where the conflict is yeah i\
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4836) mean i\
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4836) i wouldn't bring this this uh\
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4839) x equals essence y equals essence z\
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4842) equals essence therefore x equals y and\
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4843) y\
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4844) equals z thing i think that this can\
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4845) apply to the physical world but\
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4847) there is no physical analogy for the\
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4849) trinity this is uh\
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4850) is a very mysterious thing as we get\
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4852) into metaphysics and\
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4854) and we see that somehow there must be\
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4857) three underlying realities\
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4859) though one existence yeah but this is\
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4862) this is not a this is not a physical law\
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4864) this is a necessary logical law\
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4867) but we see it's necessary that there\
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4869) must be god's knowledge and that god's\
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4871) knowledge must be the exact\
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4874) image of his self\
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4877) i can't explain that but we see how that\
[1:21:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4879) must be the case because god is\
[1:21:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4881) necessary\
[1:21:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4881) or necessarily all-knowing i think i\
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4884) think you're understanding the problem\
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4886) because\
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4886) when i broke it down you're basically\
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4888) saying well this is a physical law\
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4891) it's not a physical law it's a logical\
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4894) law\
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4894) or something that is uh metaphysical\
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4896) that would apply to god in the sense\
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4899) now it seems almost like you're starting\
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4901) to go down\
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4902) at this point the same path of the\
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4905) previous\
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4906) individual in which you're you're\
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4908) leaning towards saying well this\
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4910) this classical law of identity doesn't\
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4913) apply to god is that right\
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4916) um i'm not saying that it's it i\
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4919) it's possible i lack knowledge on this\
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4921) certain part it's just i i can't explain\
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4923) how there are three hypostases i can\
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4925) explain how there are\
[1:22:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4927) if that makes sense even though i just\
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4929) repeat the same thing um\
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4931) i if if we can maybe move\
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4935) on and and uh it's possible i just don't\
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4938) have the proper answer when it comes to\
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4939) this\
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4940) no that's fine let's just say that in\
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4942) the beginning um\
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4944) your name is neo right yep yeah so so in\
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4947) the beginning neo when you came on it\
[1:22:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4949) seemed like you were saying that\
[1:22:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4951) there was some kind of like a\
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4952) mischaracterization of what we call the\
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4954) logical problem of the trinity\
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4956) but then further down the line\
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4959) you seem to be appealing to mystery and\
[1:22:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4961) saying that well this is mysterious and\
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4963) we can't understand it so\
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4965) fine that's okay i mean appealing to\
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4967) mystery i think\
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4968) in certain cases is fine but i think\
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4971) that does\
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4972) mean that you do acknowledge that there\
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4974) is a logical problem of the trinity\
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4976) because\
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4977) otherwise why would why else would you\
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4978) appeal to mystery no\
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4980) i i mean we believe that there are\
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4982) mysteries we think that if you could fit\
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4984) god in your head\
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4985) it's not god uh yeah yeah but say\
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4988) there's a logical problem with saying\
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4989) god is body parts\
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4991) or denying divine simplicity yeah but at\
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4993) this point you're at least\
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4994) acknowledging that i've brought up a\
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4997) good point\
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=4998) that you have to maybe think about and\
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5001) then come back and have a further\
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5002) discussion on\
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5004) and i think what brother abdul was\
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5006) trying to point out is that in the\
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5008) beginning\
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5009) it seemed like you were charging us with\
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5012) our\
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5012) um basically objections to the trinity\
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5016) were based on misconceptions\
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5018) but i think it's been shown now that\
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5020) it's not based on a misconception\
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5022) it's based on what we see is a\
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5025) legitimate problem\
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5026) and at the very least is an apparent\
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5028) problem\
[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5029) which you yourself right now don't\
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5032) necessarily have a good answer for\
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5033) i think that's fair where we're at right\
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5035) now well i mean your misconception led\
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5038) to you thinking the trinity is\
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5039) polytheism\
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5040) because you i'm showing you you guys you\
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5042) know with all respect you didn't even\
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5043) know what the trinity was\
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5045) i do know what eternity is have you\
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5047) heard of the explanation that i give\
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5049) and if you read the church yes i have\
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5052) okay who have you read\
[1:24:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5053) from the church fathers about this well\
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5056) we don't have to get let's hear it\
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5058) we don't we don't have to get into what\
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5059) i've read but\
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5061) what i'm saying i mean what what i'm\
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5063) saying to you is i can show you\
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5065) how the trinity can be understood in a\
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5067) polytheistic fashion\
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5069) what you're doing and what your model\
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5072) typically would fall under\
[1:24:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5074) would uh kind of lean more towards\
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5076) modalism\
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5077) in the collapse of the persons because\
[1:24:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5080) of the fact that you cannot explain\
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5082) really how they are distinct from one\
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5084) another\
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5085) by being somehow also identical to one\
[1:24:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5088) another\
[1:24:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5088) so there's a split there's different\
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5091) models of the trinity\
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5092) in different directions you can go with\
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5094) it and either way\
[1:24:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5096) when you go one way you wind up with a\
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5098) sort of modalistic picture\
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5100) while on the other hand with things like\
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5103) social trinitarianism\
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5104) you wind up with a polytheistic version\
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5107) of god\
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5108) which even other christians who reject\
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5110) social trinitarianism\
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5112) would agree with and i think even if i\
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5114) explain to you what that is if you don't\
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5116) know already\
[1:25:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5117) you would even notice it okay yeah i\
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5120) agree yeah\
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5122) okay so you agree with the fact that\
[1:25:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5125) social trinitarianism\
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5126) results in polytheism right yeah i mean\
[1:25:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5130) it is i wouldn't even put the word\
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5132) trinitarianism\
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5134) in there i think that'd be a blasphemy\
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5135) it's just tripartite it's three beings\
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5137) it's okay nonsense yes but you you you\
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5140) are you do know or you should know\
[1:25:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5143) that there are a lot of christians who\
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5147) you maybe you're not even comfortable\
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5148) calling them christians i don't know i\
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5150) don't really care\
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5151) the point is that there are people who\
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5153) are claiming to be christians\
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5154) very popular apologists such as william\
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5157) lane craig\
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5158) richard swinburne he's a protestant\
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5161) right\
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5162) well well no richard i mean they're like\
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5164) the ahmadi of\
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5165) christianity it's richard they got their\
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5168) own thing going\
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5168) richard swinburne belongs to the eastern\
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5170) orthodox church\
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5172) but nevertheless he does so\
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5175) the point my point is that it is\
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5179) popular in christian apologetics today\
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5182) especially in contemporary christian\
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5183) philosophy in this idea of a social\
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5186) trinity\
[1:26:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5187) which you are agreeing as polytheism so\
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5189) i'm saying\
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5190) that broadly speaking there's two models\
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5193) very broadly there's two sorts of models\
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5196) and i'm arguing\
[1:26:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5197) that if you go one way and you define\
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5200) the persons in such a way that they\
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5202) aren't distinct enough you wind up with\
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5204) this modalistic problem\
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5206) where they're identical to each other\
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5208) which is i think what you've sort of\
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5209) collapsed into\
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5210) on the other hand if you define the\
[1:26:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5212) persons so\
[1:26:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5214) separately from one another then you\
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5216) wind up with social trinitarianism\
[1:26:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5218) or a version of polytheism or tritheism\
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5222) so i don't think that uh we\
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5225) especially myself we've misrepresented\
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5227) anything about christianity or the\
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5230) trinity whatsoever\
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5231) and anytime we did bring up the issue of\
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5234) polytheism\
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5235) this is sort of what we're referring to\
[1:27:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5237) i would say that you don't necessarily\
[1:27:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5239) have a problem with polytheism right now\
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5241) but you have an incoherence in your own\
[1:27:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5243) model in saying that these two things\
[1:27:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5245) are identical to the essence\
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5247) but then they're not identical to one\
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5248) another and this violates the law of\
[1:27:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5250) identity\
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5251) which basically collapses into modalism\
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5254) that's the argument for you\
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5255) okay so i have a couple questions so\
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5257) first off do you believe that there's a\
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5259) real distinction between god's\
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5261) you know self and his knowledge yes or\
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5264) no what do you mean by that\
[1:27:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5267) between god and his knowledge do you\
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5269) think that there's a real distinction\
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5270) between the two\
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5272) there is god and there is his knowledge\
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5274) and these are two realities within god\
[1:27:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5276) on the islamic conception yeah because\
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5279) you said you did not believe in divine\
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5281) simplicity\
[1:28:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5282) no we don't believe we don't believe in\
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5283) divine simplicity\
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5285) so you believe that there's god and\
[1:28:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5287) there's god's knowledge\
[1:28:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5289) are you aware neo that the problem with\
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5291) divine simplicity is\
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5293) when you talk about attributes or even\
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5295) persons\
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5296) they are in essence talking about the\
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5298) same thing\
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5300) and there's no distinction between them\
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5302) so there's no distinction\
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5305) yeah so for example god's knowledge and\
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5308) god's wrath\
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5309) and god's love and god's mercy would all\
[1:28:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5312) be identical\
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5313) under divine simplicity in a sense and\
[1:28:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5316) then of course in another sense they're\
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5317) not\
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5318) yeah of course no no it's not even in\
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5320) the sense that they're not\
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5322) yes so for example\
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5325) under divine one of the criticisms of\
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5326) divine simplicity uh\
[1:28:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5329) uh that has been brought up is the fact\
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5331) that it collapses\
[1:28:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5333) in which there are no uh distinguishing\
[1:28:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5336) attributes within god\
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5337) they're all identical to the essence the\
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5340) attribute is identical to the essence\
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5343) yes but these the attributes are merely\
[1:29:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5346) human concepts that we attribute to him\
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5348) in the first place\
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5350) right they're identical to the essence\
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5351) in the sense that whatever god has he is\
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5355) in the sense in which these attributes\
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5356) are not his essence it's they're human\
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5358) concepts that we're observing in\
[1:29:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5359) creation\
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5360) we didn't look at god we looked at\
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5362) creation and attributed\
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5364) these ideas so does god really have\
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5366) knowledge\
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5367) well no he's above that you know the\
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5369) scriptures say his his true name is is\
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5371) unknown to all men it's above all the\
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5372) names that we attribute to him\
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5375) yeah he's the infinite one he's not\
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5379) i agree with you in the fact that the\
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5381) attributes of god are not something\
[1:29:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5383) it's something that we come to\
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5384) understand through the nature of the\
[1:29:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5385) universe isn't it so we're not saying\
[1:29:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5387) that they are identical\
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5389) to god yeah so we come to know that\
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5392) there is\
[1:29:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5393) a creator because we sense creation that\
[1:29:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5396) there is a necessary being or\
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5398) a self-sufficient eternal being because\
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5400) there are contingent beings\
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5402) dependent uh beings that exist so we\
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5405) come to these conclusions\
[1:30:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5407) however under the model of divine\
[1:30:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5409) simplicity\
[1:30:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5411) coming to that conclusion that god is\
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5414) the creator\
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5415) he's self-sufficient he's merc he has\
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5418) knowledge all these uh\
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5420) you know necessary attributes that they\
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5421) talk about would have to be\
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5423) identical to one another and be\
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5425) identical\
[1:30:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5426) to the uh to the essence of god\
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5430) under that model how do you and you you\
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5432) mentioned obviously you said that\
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5433) attributes are something that we\
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5435) mentally construct yeah by observation\
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5437) of the universe\
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5438) but under the the model of divine\
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5441) simplicity how do you\
[1:30:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5442) affirm the persons of god as being\
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5445) distinct\
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5446) while also accepting that they're all\
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5448) the same god\
[1:30:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5451) i have to know i'm just a genuine\
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5452) question because i've never understood\
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5454) how\
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5454) uh divine simplicities if that's the\
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5457) word\
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5458) to use how they reconcile under\
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5460) trinitarian view\
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5462) the fact that you have different you\
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5464) know persons of god\
[1:31:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5465) but they're exactly the same as god but\
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5467) they're also exactly\
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5469) differentiating between themselves\
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5472) distinct\
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5472) yeah yeah so\
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5476) it's a good question so first and\
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5476) foremost of course it's by god's\
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5478) revelation to us that we know this for a\
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5480) fact\
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5480) he's revealed himself as a trinity uh\
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5482) he's revealed himself as god\
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5484) his logos and his you know internal\
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5486) operation or his spirit\
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5487) you know the breath uh you know\
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5491) we can see we can work off of logic and\
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5493) see wow this\
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5494) this must be the case because within\
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5496) this\
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5498) uh you know self-comprehension analogy\
[1:31:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5499) we see there must be a knower and we\
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5501) must\
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5501) see that there's a thing that is known\
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5503) of course for god to know\
[1:31:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5505) there must be a thought for him to think\
[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5506) there must be a thought\
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5508) so there's a thinker there's a thought\
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5511) and there's a thinking you know the\
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5514) thinker uses the thinking to know the\
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5515) thought\
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5516) like the god\
[1:32:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5521) you know god knows best but we see that\
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5524) it must be the case\
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5526) we must appeal the mystery at some point\
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5528) if we don't i mean\
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5529) it's a creation that we're thinking of\
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5531) do you think god's existence is\
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5533) necessary\
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5535) of course yeah do you think god's one\
[1:32:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5538) act of creation is identical to his\
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5540) essence\
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5542) god's in himself yes but it is not\
[1:32:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5545) necessary\
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5546) okay so god's act of creation is\
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5549) identical\
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5551) to his essence which is necessary\
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5554) so again you you wind up having the the\
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5556) same issue\
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5558) that you either have what's called the\
[1:32:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5559) modal collapse i don't know if you're\
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5561) sure\
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5561) heard of the motor collapse yes but so\
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5564) you have on the one hand you either have\
[1:32:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5567) to accept the modal collapse because of\
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5569) what i'm just explaining\
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5571) or you you say there is no motor\
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5574) collapse\
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5575) and you wind up with the same problem\
[1:32:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5577) that we just explained about the law of\
[1:32:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5579) identity when you say that\
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5581) god's existence is necessary god's one\
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5585) act of creation is identical to his\
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5588) existence\
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5589) and therefore that would have to be\
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5591) necessary but that's the very thing\
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5593) that orthodox christianity denies when\
[1:33:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5595) it says\
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5596) that god's act of creation is free and\
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5599) not necessary so you have an\
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5601) internal contradiction in your model\
[1:33:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5604) i i say that there's something beyond\
[1:33:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5607) our comprehension that we\
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5608) we you know can't even really explain i\
[1:33:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5611) mean when it comes to god being the\
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5612) infinite one how can we even describe\
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5615) infinity we we can never name anything\
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5618) precisely of god in the first place\
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5621) but i mean on the contra to the contrary\
[1:33:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5624) if you if you think that\
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5625) it is not his essence and that it's\
[1:33:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5628) something else there's something\
[1:33:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5629) else existing along the side for all of\
[1:33:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5632) eternity alongside god for all of\
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5633) eternity\
[1:33:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5634) meaning it's another god it's another\
[1:33:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5636) existence\
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5637) there's nothing outside of god but\
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5639) anyway i believe his act of creation is\
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5642) eternal right\
[1:34:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5643) or did he begin to create which would\
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5646) cause him to change\
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5648) no so you want to say something yeah i\
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5651) know he's gonna say see neo\
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5652) what you seem to be doing because you\
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5654) seem to be moving from being a divine\
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5655) simplistic\
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5657) believing in divine simplicity yeah and\
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5659) then moving away from divine simplicity\
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5661) when it becomes problematic because of\
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5663) the\
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5664) the logical implication or entailment of\
[1:34:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5667) that particular\
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5668) uh belief system um by saying it well\
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5671) it's a mystery\
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5672) yeah i'm just saying is that look if\
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5675) if you're gonna affirm something about\
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5676) god like saying that god\
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5678) is a divinely simple being\
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5681) then you have to accept all of its\
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5683) logical entailments for it\
[1:34:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5685) i don't think what you can do is simply\
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5686) say well we affirm it here when it's\
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5688) convenient\
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5689) and then you know when there are\
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5692) questions that we cannot reconcile\
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5693) because obviously our minds are limited\
[1:34:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5696) we suddenly leave it and then appeal to\
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5698) mystery\
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5699) you know um because divine simplicity\
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5702) like i said\
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5703) entails that the attributes are exactly\
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5706) the same as the\
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5706) essence and there's no distinction\
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5709) between any of the attributes\
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5711) they're all exactly the same now even if\
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5714) you turn around and say well that's a\
[1:35:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5715) mental construction because of\
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5717) observation of the universe\
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5719) but when when christians talk about a\
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5721) trinity they're not talking about human\
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5723) construction\
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5724) of god they are talking about these\
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5726) things as being real\
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5728) things yeah they are concrete realities\
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5731) that exist but they're on the one hand\
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5735) identical to this divinely simple being\
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5739) god but at the same time you're not\
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5742) accepting the fact that\
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5743) divine simplicity would then entail that\
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5745) they would have to be\
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5746) identical to each other because that\
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5748) goes against the christian doctrine\
[1:35:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5751) yeah uh you know in terms of the fact\
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5752) that they are distinct persons\
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5754) and that's the problem the problem here\
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5756) is that you've got two\
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5757) positions two propositions or two belief\
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5759) claims that you're holding\
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5761) they don't they don't reconcile and it's\
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5764) not the problem of\
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5765) the mystery it's the problem of the\
[1:36:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5768) claims that are being made\
[1:36:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5770) are not reconcilable yeah\
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5773) um i think we have a couple other people\
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5776) waiting\
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5777) we might want to uh bring somebody else\
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5780) on brother youssef i don't know\
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5782) if you're there or uh i don't know if\
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5784) neo wants to make it a little quite last\
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5786) yeah\
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5788) i really appreciate it yeah uh yeah i\
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5791) enjoyed this i mean i'll say that you\
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5793) know we\
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5793) there's there's apatheticism there's\
[1:36:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5795) cataphase of course\
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5796) i mean we can say that this cannot be\
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5799) the case uh the following things cannot\
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5801) be the case\
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5801) that god is composite and so therefore\
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5804) he's simple\
[1:36:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5805) how can we understand that he's simple\
[1:36:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5807) by being apathetic we know that he\
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5808) cannot be composite\
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5809) because he's not a finite being he does\
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5812) not begin to create\
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5814) he does not change therefore he's\
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5816) outside of time but what does outside of\
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5818) time even mean\
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5820) who knows god knows and whatever that is\
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5823) whatever you know\
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5824) the perfect description of that you know\
[1:37:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5827) being outside of time\
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5828) or of that infinity the infinite aspect\
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5832) of god\
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5832) no one knows how to name that because\
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5834) the name is his essence no one can\
[1:37:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5836) comprehend the essence we only know him\
[1:37:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5838) by creation\
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5839) and so at the end of the day we're\
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5841) always going to be making analogies and\
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5842) analogies\
[1:37:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5843) never is there going to be an absolutely\
[1:37:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5845) perfect\
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5847) analogy it seems that we can kind of\
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5850) come closer and closer to\
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5853) when it comes to this but we we got to\
[1:37:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5855) be apathetic we know that\
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5858) god does not begin to create and so\
[1:37:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5861) therefore god creates\
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5863) in a sense we can say he creates\
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5865) eternally that is to say outside of time\
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5868) and because there's only god outside of\
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5870) time there's nothing else outside of\
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5871) time\
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5872) then there's only god's essence outside\
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5873) of time but seeing that also in concept\
[1:37:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5877) you know conceptually we could say that\
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5878) god his act of creation is outside of\
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5881) time\
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5881) we can therefore say that god's act of\
[1:38:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5883) creation is his essence\
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5886) but again because these analogies are\
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5887) not absolutely 100 perfect\
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5889) we have to appeal to mystery at some\
[1:38:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5891) point and if we don't\
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5893) we'd have to say that god is composite\
[1:38:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5895) that god is finite\
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5897) that a human being can understand the\
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5898) fullness in every single thing about god\
[1:38:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5901) which of course would just make him part\
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5903) of creation\
[1:38:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5905) so if that makes sense but i did\
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5908) enjoy this discussion hopefully uh in\
[1:38:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5910) the future thanks neo appreciate you\
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5912) being known\
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5913) cool until next time\
[1:38:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5916) uh so we've been going for about an hour\
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5920) and 40 minutes i reckon we've got justin\
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5922) here\
[1:38:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5923) um so we'll bring oh where'd he go\
[1:38:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5925) before we get justin\
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5927) before he comes on i was just gonna say\
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5929) to uh jake about\
[1:38:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5931) the thoughts about this idea that\
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5933) adhering to divine simplicity\
[1:38:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5935) as well as adhering to a concept of\
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5937) trinitarianism\
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5939) i i can't see any reconciliation between\
[1:39:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5942) the two\
[1:39:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5943) no i mean i can't either and hence why\
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5946) um i think it became apparent\
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5949) in the discussion with neo um i think he\
[1:39:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5952) was\
[1:39:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5953) respectful so i'm not disrespect him in\
[1:39:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5956) any way but\
[1:39:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5956) he came on initially very confident and\
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5960) seemed like um we\
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5963) making the sort of claim that we were\
[1:39:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5965) our arguments\
[1:39:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5966) were based on misconceptions or\
[1:39:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5969) misrepresentations of what\
[1:39:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5970) trinitarians actually believed and then\
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5973) when we got down to the nitty-gritty\
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5976) and sort of the argument based on\
[1:39:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5980) the the law of identity was presented to\
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5982) him especially given his\
[1:39:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5984) understanding of divine simplicity it\
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5987) basically collapsed\
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5988) i think he recognized the problem didn't\
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5991) really have a good answer for it\
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5993) and thus that's when he kind of threw up\
[1:39:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5995) the mystery card\
[1:39:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=5997) which is fine as brother abdul said i'm\
[1:40:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6000) not trying to like\
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6001) bash him or anything but i'm just\
[1:40:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6003) pointing out for the audience because\
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6006) you know the audience may not know\
[1:40:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6008) exactly or\
[1:40:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6009) really understand what's happening in\
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6011) the conversation so i'm just kind of\
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6013) recapping what happened yeah i do want\
[1:40:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6016) to say about divine simplicity and\
[1:40:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6018) trinitarianism i cannot understand it\
[1:40:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6021) whatsoever\
[1:40:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6022) because the idea is making a distinction\
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6025) between the being and the persons so if\
[1:40:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6028) at the fundamental level there's this\
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6030) distinction between the being and the\
[1:40:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6032) persons\
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6033) how could you say that they're identical\
[1:40:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6035) and that's what he did is he wound up\
[1:40:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6037) saying that the persons\
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6039) were identical to the essence but then\
[1:40:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6042) the persons are not identical\
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6044) to one another which it would seem to\
[1:40:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6046) follow that they are\
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6048) and when i pointed that out that's when\
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6050) the mystery card came up because\
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6052) he saw the implications of how much of a\
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6055) problem that is\
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6056) yeah so just to maybe just just to\
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6059) reiterate\
[1:41:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6060) uh when you say the problem of identity\
[1:41:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6063) what you're basically saying is this\
[1:41:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6065) is that if x is\
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6068) a and y is a then\
[1:41:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6071) x is y yes they are identical to each\
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6075) other\
[1:41:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6076) you can't have x being a y is also\
[1:41:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6079) a but x is not y yeah it's just like in\
[1:41:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6083) algebra\
[1:41:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6083) like if you uh if you put in a value\
[1:41:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6087) for x and y and or x y\
[1:41:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6090) and z say and they were the same number\
[1:41:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6092) okay you said that\
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6094) x was identical to y and y\
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6097) is identical to z then it would just\
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6100) follow that\
[1:41:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6101) x is identical to z also so\
[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6104) that's that's the whole problem is that\
[1:41:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6106) essentially he was saying that\
[1:41:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6108) these two things are identical to this\
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6111) third thing\
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6112) but those two things are not identical\
[1:41:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6115) to one another\
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6116) that it doesn't make sense it doesn't\
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6118) make sense that's right and i think the\
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6119) other problem\
[1:42:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6120) the other issue is in terms of divine\
[1:42:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6122) simplicity see i didn't understand\
[1:42:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6124) why he had to affirm divine simplicity\
[1:42:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6126) because\
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6127) you know it's an unnecessary\
[1:42:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6129) metaphysical commitment on his behalf\
[1:42:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6132) because every time you pointed out\
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6135) the problems with the persons or the\
[1:42:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6137) problems the fact that god is a\
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6138) necessary being but his act of creation\
[1:42:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6140) was free wasn't necessary\
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6142) he's suddenly saying yeah what do we\
[1:42:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6143) mean by god creating outside of time\
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6146) it's not\
[1:42:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6147) you know you know necessary to god but\
[1:42:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6150) it's free so all of these things they\
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6152) don't they don't\
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6154) uh they don't lead to the conclusion of\
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6156) an absolute divine simplicity\
[1:42:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6158) and maybe also for the audience to\
[1:42:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6159) understand what an absolute divine\
[1:42:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6161) simplicity is referring to\
[1:42:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6163) is the idea that god is not making\
[1:42:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6166) in i think it was thomas aquinas and\
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6168) aristotle's philosophy but certainly\
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6170) thomas aquinas popularized it within\
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6172) christianity\
[1:42:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6173) is that they had the conception that god\
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6175) has to be absolutely\
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6177) simple cannot be made of any parts\
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6180) including abstract notions of\
[1:43:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6183) attributes they can't be parts of god\
[1:43:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6187) so therefore they have to be identical\
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6189) to god so the attribute\
[1:43:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6191) is identical to god but the problem with\
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6194) that is if you say the attribute is\
[1:43:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6196) identical to god\
[1:43:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6197) that god's mercy is identical to god\
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6200) and god's wrath is identified identical\
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6203) identical to god\
[1:43:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6205) then god's mercy is identical to god's\
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6208) wrath\
[1:43:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6209) yeah yeah so to add something there\
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6213) about the divine simplicity problem um\
[1:43:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6216) regardless of of what you know like like\
[1:43:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6219) whether it is an actual\
[1:43:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6220) actually a problem and when we're\
[1:43:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6221) discussing composites and and\
[1:43:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6223) stuff in relation to god and this whole\
[1:43:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6226) divine simplicity discussion comes up as\
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6228) a solution\
[1:43:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6229) i think that's a shared problem between\
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6232) both world views islam and christianity\
[1:43:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6234) or like unitarianism and trinitarianism\
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6237) i think there's a difference i mean\
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6238) there are always going to be paradoxes\
[1:44:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6240) to a certain extent i'm not saying that\
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6242) this one is unresolvable but let's say\
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6244) for the sake of argument that it is\
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6246) there are always going to be certain\
[1:44:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6247) like uh stopping points and paradoxes\
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6251) in any kind of line of reasoning so if\
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6253) you start with a line of reasoning\
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6255) that is valid and that takes you to a\
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6257) place that leads to\
[1:44:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6258) a paradox let's say russell's paradox\
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6261) from set theory or or or\
[1:44:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6263) russell's uh propositions paradox these\
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6266) are paradoxes that\
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6267) result out of a necessary and valid\
[1:44:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6271) line of reasoning that's very different\
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6273) when you start with a problem\
[1:44:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6275) you start with an unnecessary apparently\
[1:44:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6278) contradictory notion\
[1:44:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6280) which in this case is the trinity and\
[1:44:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6283) from there you\
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6284) try to do the legwork and resolving it\
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6286) it's kind of the reverse of the\
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6288) situation with the divine simplicity\
[1:44:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6289) issue\
[1:44:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6290) both muslims and christians believe that\
[1:44:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6293) our reason takes us to\
[1:44:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6297) this point of a necessary being\
[1:45:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6300) and then all the metaphysical the deep\
[1:45:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6302) metaphysical discussions we have about\
[1:45:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6304) the nature of\
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6306) this necessary being may or may not\
[1:45:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6308) result in these sort of\
[1:45:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6310) uh uh deep questions uh and\
[1:45:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6313) and from there you can you can you can\
[1:45:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6316) you can analyze whether you want to have\
[1:45:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6317) that like kind of ontological cost and\
[1:45:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6319) go for like a divine simplicity\
[1:45:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6321) uh commitment or a say that you know you\
[1:45:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6324) don't have a problem with metaphysical\
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6325) composites\
[1:45:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6326) but regardless the the reason there is\
[1:45:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6329) a quote-unquote problem is is\
[1:45:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6332) because you started with a very valid\
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6334) line of reasoning that took you to a\
[1:45:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6336) certain place\
[1:45:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6337) where they're going to be all these\
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6338) kinds of metaphysical questions that you\
[1:45:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6340) may or may not be able to answer\
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6342) the difference between that and the\
[1:45:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6343) trinity is that in the case of the\
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6345) trinity you start with the problem\
[1:45:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6346) you're starting with this extra baggage\
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6349) on the notion of a necessary being that\
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6351) is\
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6351) unnecessary for us to have a sound or a\
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6355) reasonable\
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6355) conception of god and from there you try\
[1:45:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6357) to solve all these problems so i i think\
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6359) that's a huge difference\
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6360) we have that divine simplicity\
[1:46:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6362) discussion in common between both faiths\
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6364) so it's not like\
[1:46:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6366) it's not like if if it's a it's an\
[1:46:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6369) ontological cost in one faith or the\
[1:46:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6371) other because\
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6372) i think we're on par in that in that\
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6374) sense\
[1:46:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6375) but then i think the whole logical\
[1:46:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6377) problem of the trinity is\
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6378) an entirely different uh kind of uh\
[1:46:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6381) question to answer because it starts\
[1:46:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6383) with the problem and doesn't end with it\
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6385) yeah just sorry yeah i just want to say\
[1:46:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6389) that\
[1:46:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6389) yes i mean that is an issue that the\
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6392) muslim scholars have addressed\
[1:46:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6394) um for example the the overall opinion\
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6398) of the ummah is that we reject absolute\
[1:46:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6401) divine simplicity\
[1:46:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6403) now the tesli and some of the\
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6404) philosophers like even cena\
[1:46:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6407) they believed in it but overall the\
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6409) ashari's the atharys\
[1:46:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6411) mataridis they all reject absolute\
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6414) divine simplicity in favor of the idea\
[1:46:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6416) that god does have multiple real\
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6419) attributes that they're not identical to\
[1:47:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6421) one another\
[1:47:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6422) now how actually do we resolve the\
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6424) problem and he was\
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6426) mentioning of god being a composite or\
[1:47:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6428) made of\
[1:47:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6429) parts we don't believe that god is a\
[1:47:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6431) composite or made of parts\
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6433) in that sense because when you think\
[1:47:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6435) about a part like if i chop off my hand\
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6438) i would still exist so in a sense the\
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6441) hand is a part of me right\
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6443) but because it's a part because i can\
[1:47:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6446) part with it\
[1:47:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6448) but god in terms of his necessary and\
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6450) essential attributes\
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6452) he cannot part from them they're\
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6454) inseparable from his\
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6456) essence now they're not identical to one\
[1:47:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6458) another but they're not parts because\
[1:47:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6460) they're not the sort of thing\
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6461) that he can part with so i think we can\
[1:47:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6465) go into more depth and maybe i plan on\
[1:47:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6467) doing on my own channel uh\
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6470) sort of a deeper explanation of this and\
[1:47:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6472) going into these things further\
[1:47:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6474) and i would agree with you abdul that\
[1:47:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6475) it's a question that muslims have to\
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6477) answer to as well\
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6478) the differences and i think what brother\
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6481) sharif was trying to point out\
[1:48:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6483) and what i was piggybacking on is that\
[1:48:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6486) mixing divine simplicity with\
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6490) the trinity just seems like two things\
[1:48:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6492) that cannot possibly work together\
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6495) that that's what the real issue is like\
[1:48:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6498) when you're bringing up when you have\
[1:48:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6500) this fundamental understanding of the\
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6502) trinity\
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6502) and then also you have this fundamental\
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6504) belief in divine simplicity it's like\
[1:48:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6507) whoa how do you make these two things\
[1:48:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6509) work\
[1:48:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6510) uh it seems even more difficult to do\
[1:48:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6513) without collapsing the persons into one\
[1:48:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6516) and so\
[1:48:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6517) i think i agree with you it's an issue\
[1:48:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6519) that we have to answer and like i said\
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6521) maybe i'll do some videos on it\
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6523) but i think mixing the idea of three\
[1:48:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6526) distinct persons\
[1:48:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6528) with absolute divine simplicity is just\
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6531) impossible i don't see how it could work\
[1:48:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6533) yeah just just just just i just want to\
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6535) add because brother mustachine just made\
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6536) a very interesting comment in the chat\
[1:48:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6539) and just to clarify what i was saying\
[1:49:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6540) earlier i think it does clarify it\
[1:49:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6543) it's about the universality of the the\
[1:49:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6546) creed or the conception of god\
[1:49:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6548) so we know that like if someone in like\
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6550) a disconnected\
[1:49:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6551) civilization or tribe or something could\
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6554) rationally arrive\
[1:49:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6555) at a unitary conception of god and he\
[1:49:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6558) would be rationally justified in doing\
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6560) so\
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6560) but you can't through natural theology\
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6563) alone\
[1:49:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6564) arrive at a trinitarian conception of\
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6565) god i just don't see how you could do\
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6567) that\
[1:49:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6568) so the problem if it is a problem i'm\
[1:49:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6570) just granting for the sake of argument\
[1:49:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6572) that if there is a problem with like\
[1:49:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6573) composites\
[1:49:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6574) and we have to have a discussion about\
[1:49:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6575) divine simplicity that is a problem that\
[1:49:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6578) does arise\
[1:49:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6579) through natural theology because\
[1:49:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6582) it take it does take you natural\
[1:49:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6584) theology does take you to the universal\
[1:49:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6586) concept\
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6587) of a unitary being which means that the\
[1:49:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6589) conception of a unitary\
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6591) uh god is more universal it's obviously\
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6595) universal and the\
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6596) trinitarian conception of god is not\
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6598) something that you can arrive at\
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6600) without revelation so it's it's\
[1:50:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6603) it's like the nature of the problems are\
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6605) entirely different one you arrive at\
[1:50:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6607) through reason\
[1:50:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6608) and the other is just a problem like\
[1:50:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6610) right off the gate from the outset\
[1:50:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6613) can i i know i know just in oh sorry i\
[1:50:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6615) was just gonna say\
[1:50:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6616) no no we've got justin sat there for\
[1:50:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6620) ages and we're just kind of ignoring him\
[1:50:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6622) so i think it's got\
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6623) a good point to kind of get him involved\
[1:50:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6625) in the conversation how you doing justin\
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6626) sorry to\
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6627) i may have brought you in a little bit\
[1:50:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6628) early there and it might have been\
[1:50:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6630) slightly awkward\
[1:50:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6631) i know you guys are good you guys are\
[1:50:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6632) good so forgive me\
[1:50:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6634) how are you doing i'm i'm good i can you\
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6637) guys hear me fine\
[1:50:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6638) yeah perfect okay cool cool i'm in my\
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6641) truck and i'm through my bluetooth\
[1:50:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6643) speakers i want to make sure\
[1:50:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6644) i don't sound like crap on your show\
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6648) so entertaining conversation with both\
[1:50:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6653) of the guests today\
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6654) frustrating as usual um they took away\
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6658) both of the points that i was going to\
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6659) talk to you guys about when i came on\
[1:51:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6661) and one of them being something that i\
[1:51:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6663) think i mentioned on one of your\
[1:51:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6664) previous uh shows\
[1:51:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6666) is that when you guys bring up these\
[1:51:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6669) logical issues within the foundations of\
[1:51:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6671) christianity\
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6672) what they normally fire back with is\
[1:51:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6674) ignoring the point at hand\
[1:51:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6676) and going straight to flying donkeys\
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6680) splitting the moon in half muhammad's a\
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6682) pedophile you know whatever they want to\
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6684) talk about\
[1:51:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6685) and it's not exactly on par with the\
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6688) arguments that you guys are making for\
[1:51:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6689) one it's\
[1:51:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6690) a shifting of the goal post it's a red\
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6692) herring trying to get you off\
[1:51:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6694) off of something else and just go in\
[1:51:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6696) this direction instead\
[1:51:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6697) but a an equivalent argument to the\
[1:51:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6701) the splitting of the moons the flying\
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6702) donkeys the you know\
[1:51:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6704) uh the consummation uh that muhammad had\
[1:51:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6707) with\
[1:51:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6708) you know his wife you know an equivalent\
[1:51:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6711) argument for that is if you guys were\
[1:51:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6712) like hey christians i got a defeater for\
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6714) christianity\
[1:51:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6715) how in the hell did jonah live in a fish\
[1:51:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6717) for three days\
[1:51:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6718) like that would be something equivalent\
[1:52:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6720) to the arguments that they bring to you\
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6722) guys\
[1:52:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6723) so that was one of the points that one\
[1:52:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6725) of the christians your first guest\
[1:52:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6726) ended up taking away that i you know\
[1:52:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6728) that i wanted to bring up but he did it\
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6730) on the show\
[1:52:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6731) and it kind of like proved my point and\
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6733) then the second one was the constant\
[1:52:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6736) when we get into these discussions at\
[1:52:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6738) the very onset of the discussion\
[1:52:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6740) is that there is no logical problem it\
[1:52:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6742) is concise\
[1:52:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6743) it is consistent there are no issues and\
[1:52:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6745) i'm confident\
[1:52:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6746) and i can show you guys this and at the\
[1:52:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6749) very end\
[1:52:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6750) we throw up the mystery card multiple\
[1:52:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6752) times and like you guys said it's not\
[1:52:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6754) exactly\
[1:52:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6755) a bad you know it's not it's not exactly\
[1:52:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6758) not understandable that we can't fully\
[1:52:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6761) understand god\
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6762) but in something that you're so\
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6764) confident at the onset\
[1:52:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6766) and then throughout the conversation you\
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6768) say well i mean\
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6770) he just doesn't adhere to logic or we\
[1:52:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6772) just don't\
[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6773) understand it it's it's kind of\
[1:52:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6775) counter-intuitive\
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6776) to the attitude or demeanor that you had\
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6778) at the onset of the argument\
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6780) yeah and this is a this is a point that\
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6782) i pointed out in a\
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6784) discussion with somebody else but it\
[1:53:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6786) applies here in the same way\
[1:53:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6788) if they would have come on from the\
[1:53:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6790) beginning and say hey look guys\
[1:53:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6793) i understand what your problem is but\
[1:53:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6795) you have to understand\
[1:53:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6796) the trinity is a mystery we cannot fully\
[1:53:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6798) understand god\
[1:53:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6800) and i'm not going to be able to give you\
[1:53:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6802) an answer to these difficult questions\
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6804) then in some sense i could respect that\
[1:53:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6807) and not that i don't respect\
[1:53:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6809) the two guys that we had on because i\
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6811) think i i do and we had a good\
[1:53:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6813) conversation\
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6814) but what actually happened especially\
[1:53:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6816) with the\
[1:53:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6817) second gentleman neo as he came on\
[1:53:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6820) and he made the claim that our arguments\
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6824) were due\
[1:53:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6825) to misconceptions of what the\
[1:53:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6827) trinitarian\
[1:53:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6828) doctrine is and what the trinitarians\
[1:53:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6831) actually believe\
[1:53:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6832) and that there really is no problem and\
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6835) then when we got into the argument\
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6837) it flipped around and and said well no\
[1:54:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6840) actually i don't have a good answer to\
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6842) this thing\
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6842) this is a legitimate problem and here's\
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6845) the mystery card\
[1:54:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6846) so that's what that's what is\
[1:54:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6848) frustrating that\
[1:54:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6850) it's it's not necessarily the answer\
[1:54:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6853) it's the sequence of the events\
[1:54:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6855) it's sort of like a moving of the goal\
[1:54:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6857) post that you're mentioning justin\
[1:54:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6859) they start off with a certain demeanor\
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6862) and a certain\
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6862) answer and then when we get into the\
[1:54:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6865) actual argument of the conversation\
[1:54:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6867) it switches to something else and so\
[1:54:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6870) that's what i just find\
[1:54:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6872) a little bit frustrating although i did\
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6875) really enjoy the conversations\
[1:54:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6877) but it i understand what you're saying\
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6879) and it can be\
[1:54:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6880) a little bit frustrating yeah and\
[1:54:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6884) go interesting so well i was just going\
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6887) to say so since they took both of my\
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6889) points\
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6889) i had to at the last minute come up with\
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6891) something else to bring you guys\
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6893) so i actually came up with an argument\
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6895) that you guys will not be able to refute\
[1:54:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6898) okay okay and i even i even played it\
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6901) out here for you\
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6902) i wrote it down so so we got the three\
[1:55:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6905) persons of god that we've been talking\
[1:55:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6906) about today so one plus one plus one\
[1:55:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6908) obviously equals three\
[1:55:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6910) so if it obviously equals three there's\
[1:55:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6913) also\
[1:55:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6913) uh space time and matter so if you add\
[1:55:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6915) the space time and matter\
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6917) you get six right so within\
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6920) six space time and matter through\
[1:55:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6922) absolute divine simplicity\
[1:55:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6924) would be uh would be identical to each\
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6927) other so you have\
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6928) three sixes right here they're identical\
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6930) to each other there's nothing\
[1:55:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6932) different between them which 666 is\
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6935) what comes out of that 666 equals\
[1:55:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6937) atheism\
[1:55:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6939) prove me wrong\
[1:55:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6940)Laughter
[1:55:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6950) it's true because it follows its own\
[1:55:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6951) logic\
[1:55:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6954) and it's a mystery yeah\
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6957) but just on this point about mystery you\
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6959) know i tried to preempt the point\
[1:56:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6961) at the beginning when i said that look\
[1:56:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6964) the mystery card can't be used\
[1:56:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6966) because there is people making claims\
[1:56:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6970) about god like for example somebody\
[1:56:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6972) knocking on the door and saying that the\
[1:56:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6974) guy\
[1:56:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6974) is six feet tall and five feet tall at\
[1:56:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6977) the same time and you're like well how\
[1:56:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6978) does that work\
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6979) you then have to explain how it works\
[1:56:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6982) and how it's not a contradiction\
[1:56:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6984) and in the same way when they turn\
[1:56:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6986) around and say jesus is god holy ghost\
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6988) is god the father is god but there is\
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6990) exactly one god\
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6991) but they're not the same people persons\
[1:56:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6994) amongst each other\
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6995) then you have to explain how this works\
[1:56:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=6998) because the problem that you've got and\
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7000) this is the\
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7000) this is the issue that within\
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7002) christianity that that they have to\
[1:56:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7004) resolve\
[1:56:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7005) is how does that look anything different\
[1:56:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7008) to try theism yeah because they will say\
[1:56:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7011) no no it's not tritheism\
[1:56:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7013) so you have to then demonstrate the so\
[1:56:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7016) they might say\
[1:56:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7016) well you got one being in three persons\
[1:56:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7018) then the question becomes what does a\
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7019) person mean\
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7020) and how does that relate to a being and\
[1:57:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7022) how do the persons relate to each other\
[1:57:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7024) are the exact same thing\
[1:57:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7025) etc and then you start to say well\
[1:57:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7028) there's a mystery but then\
[1:57:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7030) the first discussion has not been solved\
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7032) which was\
[1:57:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7033) how do you solve the problem of what\
[1:57:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7035) we're seeing as apparent contradictions\
[1:57:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7037) within the text\
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7038) now i think even our first guest he made\
[1:57:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7040) the point didn't he he started\
[1:57:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7042) with the argument about superposition\
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7044) quantum superposition\
[1:57:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7046) yeah yeah we started explaining to him\
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7049) that actually\
[1:57:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7050) the way the wave function collapses on\
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7052) observation and measurement\
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7054) to a photon so it's not the case that it\
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7057) then\
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7057) also exists as a wave and as a photo\
[1:57:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7060) yeah yeah i wanted to share\
[1:57:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7062) a video on that as well actually it\
[1:57:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7064) might be a good moment to kind of segue\
[1:57:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7066) into this\
[1:57:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7067) um it's a short video but it bohmian\
[1:57:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7070) mechanics\
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7071) i think does a really good job at kind\
[1:57:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7072) of dealing i'll be honest with you\
[1:57:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7075) has been uh refuted it has\
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7078) yeah it's what\
[1:58:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7082) boom is it bulma i think his name was\
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7084) what he tried to do is he tried to argue\
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7086) that\
[1:58:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7087) on the quantum level that cannot be\
[1:58:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7089) unpredictability\
[1:58:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7090) there has to be the ability to predict\
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7093) every single particle\
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7094) in its position in its motion he then\
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7097) said that the wave function itself\
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7100) has some hidden variable\
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7103) that allows us to predict where the\
[1:58:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7105) thing or the particle will be at that\
[1:58:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7106) particular moment in time yeah\
[1:58:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7108) so that it's deterministic follows a\
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7110) deterministic course\
[1:58:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7113) but that hidden variable in essence has\
[1:58:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7116) been proven to be\
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7117) incorrect and wrong and it just doesn't\
[1:58:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7120) it\
[1:58:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7120) it just doesn't fit within the mass and\
[1:58:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7123) it also creates more problems\
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7124) within quantum mechanics so there's a\
[1:58:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7127) video here specifically on the double\
[1:58:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7129) slit experiment it's only short so i'll\
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7130) play it can you just tell me\
[1:58:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7132) like where specifically they get\
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7133) something wrong because\
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7135) i'll bring it up i'll try it inshallah\
[1:59:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7141) run\
[1:59:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7142) of the experiment how does formula\
[1:59:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7144) mechanics account for the double slit\
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7146) experiment\
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7147) i mean how is it possible that we can\
[1:59:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7149) see an interference pattern\
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7150) even if we know that the particle went\
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7152) through only one of the two slits\
[1:59:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7155) us just go through the experimental\
[1:59:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7157) facts step by step\
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7160) each run of the experiment just one\
[1:59:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7163) single spot\
[1:59:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7164) appears on the detection screen in\
[1:59:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7167) bohmian mechanics\
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7168) one identifies the spot with a point\
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7171) particle\
[1:59:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7173) this particle runs from the source\
[1:59:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7176) to the screen on a continuous path\
[1:59:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7179) and the flow goes through just one of\
[1:59:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7181) the slits\
[1:59:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7183) but even though the particle goes\
[1:59:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7185) through just one of the slits\
[1:59:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7186) the other slits being open or closed\
[1:59:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7190) influences what happens so the particle\
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7194) is in a sense not free some additional\
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7197) physics\
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7197) physical entity is present and must be\
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7201) considered in the description\
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7203) the appearance of the interference\
[2:00:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7205) fringes suggests\
[2:00:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7207) that this additional entity must be some\
[2:00:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7210) kind of wave\
[2:00:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7212) the steps naturally lead to the bohmian\
[2:00:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7215) description\
[2:00:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7216) of this experiment each particle follows\
[2:00:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7220) a continuous trajectory\
[2:00:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7221) that can necessarily just go through one\
[2:00:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7224) of the slits\
[2:00:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7226) but also a wave is present that guides\
[2:00:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7229) the particle movement and travels across\
[2:00:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7232) both slits\
[2:00:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7233) the wave is responsible for the\
[2:00:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7236) appearance of the interference pattern\
[2:00:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7239) one important point in the analysis of\
[2:00:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7242) the double slit experiment\
[2:00:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7244) is usually considered to be the fact\
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7246) that\
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7247) if one determines so that's basically\
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7250) the gist of it it's just this idea that\
[2:00:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7253) um the reason you're getting this\
[2:00:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7255) interference pattern is when the\
[2:00:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7256) particle's going through it so if you\
[2:00:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7257) imagine like\
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7258) uh there's a port with two entrances and\
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7261) if\
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7261) ships are going in and they just barrel\
[2:01:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7264) in through the\
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7265) uh the slits forward they're just going\
[2:01:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7267) to go in a straight line and crash into\
[2:01:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7269) the bay\
[2:01:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7270) um you know in the same place whereas if\
[2:01:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7272) you've got a lot of waves\
[2:01:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7274) going on and you know these waves are\
[2:01:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7276) hitting the entrances to the poor\
[2:01:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7278) boats that go in are going to get pulled\
[2:01:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7279) along with these waves as they go\
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7280) through\
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7281) and you'll end up with an interference\
[2:01:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7283) pattern on the beach basically like\
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7284) they're all kind of being dragged around\
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7286) all over the show\
[2:01:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7287) um and so this accounts for the\
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7290) interference pattern\
[2:01:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7292) and i guess maybe um you could explain\
[2:01:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7295) the fact that when there's an\
[2:01:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7296) observation taking place\
[2:01:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7298) uh that the wave pattern collapses is\
[2:01:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7301) because the observation itself is\
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7302) causing more waves\
[2:01:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7304) in in some way or there's um yeah you\
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7306) know because when you\
[2:01:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7307) have two waves kind of hitting each\
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7308) other they cancel out so maybe that\
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7310) observation process is affecting it and\
[2:01:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7312) so\
[2:01:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7313) this deals with this idea that the\
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7315) particle is doing two contradictory\
[2:01:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7317) things\
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7318) um i don't see how that would\
[2:02:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7320) necessarily have been\
[2:02:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7321) refuted by what you said um\
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7325) yeah or do you still feel like it was\
[2:02:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7327) yeah so\
[2:02:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7328) uh it's it's going it's departing from\
[2:02:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7331) the concept\
[2:02:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7332) discussion on the trinity no it no it's\
[2:02:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7335) related to the trinity because people\
[2:02:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7336) bring this up\
[2:02:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7338) as a reason as to why we should abandon\
[2:02:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7340) logic when it comes to certain things\
[2:02:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7342) like why you can say\
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7343) that two things a and not a can both be\
[2:02:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7347) the same at the same time so the the\
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7348) whole slit experiment the point of this\
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7350) and bringing this up is to say no\
[2:02:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7352) because the the split\
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7353) is doing contradictory things it is um\
[2:02:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7356) both a particle and a wave\
[2:02:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7357) simultaneously it is going through one\
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7359) slit\
[2:02:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7360) and the other at the same time it's\
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7362) going through none of them at the same\
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7363) time it's going through both of them at\
[2:02:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7364) the same time or\
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7365) only one all of these possibilities\
[2:02:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7368) what it is is that it's the uh see\
[2:02:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7371) there's different\
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7372) interpretations obviously you've got the\
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7374) standard i think copenhagen\
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7376) interpretation\
[2:02:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7377) you've also got the van von neumann\
[2:02:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7379) wigner interpretation which was actually\
[2:03:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7381) quite a popular interpretation for a\
[2:03:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7383) long time\
[2:03:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7384) which is that conscious beings are the\
[2:03:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7387) things that causes the collapse of the\
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7389) wave function\
[2:03:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7390) it's you looking at it not\
[2:03:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7393) the fact that you're using and measuring\
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7395) equipment that interferes with the wave\
[2:03:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7397) pattern\
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7398) that the hello causes i don't think\
[2:03:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7400) that's the most popular one now though\
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7402) because it's\
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7402) it's not humans that are observing it\
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7404) yeah it's the cause\
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7405) it's the electrical instruments that are\
[2:03:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7407) interfering with it we're just dealing\
[2:03:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7409) with the results\
[2:03:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7410) that's right but the problem with the\
[2:03:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7411) electrical instruments is that the\
[2:03:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7412) electrical instruments the measuring\
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7414) device\
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7415) themselves are also built of quantum\
[2:03:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7417) events\
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7418) so they require an observer in order to\
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7420) observe them\
[2:03:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7421) for them to collapse here uh into a\
[2:03:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7424) particular position\
[2:03:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7426) so anyway so i'm just saying is that\
[2:03:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7427) there's lots of different uh views\
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7429) towards this\
[2:03:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7430) now in essence what they did was they\
[2:03:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7432) said okay\
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7433) let's assume there's a hidden variable\
[2:03:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7435) if there's a hidden variable\
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7436) we could maybe work out what that hidden\
[2:03:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7438) variable is in order to make the\
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7440) mathematics work\
[2:04:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7441) and what they've at all they also said\
[2:04:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7443) is it the measurement that's causing\
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7445) the effect of the particle because in\
[2:04:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7447) essence what they're trying to do is\
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7448) they're trying to say\
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7450) uh it becomes probabilistic on the local\
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7453) level on a quantum level\
[2:04:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7455) to identify the position and also\
[2:04:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7458) the emotional speed of a particle yeah\
[2:04:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7460) on a quantum level\
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7462) it's probabilistic the more you try to\
[2:04:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7464) work out the position\
[2:04:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7466) the less you're able to work out the\
[2:04:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7467) speed and vice versa\
[2:04:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7469) so they're saying is it because we're\
[2:04:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7470) looking at it and we're sending out\
[2:04:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7473) you know light waves or photons that are\
[2:04:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7475) affecting it yeah not\
[2:04:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7476) our eyes are doing it our instruments\
[2:04:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7479) are doing that yeah\
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7480) but they said no it's not that it's not\
[2:04:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7482) because there's a hidden\
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7484) variable or there's influence of the\
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7486) measuring device\
[2:04:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7487) upon what we're trying to observe they\
[2:04:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7489) said no it is actually an\
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7490) in principle problem that you can never\
[2:04:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7493) work out\
[2:04:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7493) both these two things at the same time\
[2:04:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7496) now from a muslim perspective this has\
[2:04:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7498) absolutely no\
[2:04:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7499) you know issue regards to uh our\
[2:05:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7502) metaphysics because people sometimes say\
[2:05:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7505) well yeah but you basically say allowing\
[2:05:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7507) something that's\
[2:05:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7508) non-deterministic yeah that doesn't\
[2:05:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7511) follow causality therefore how can cause\
[2:05:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7513) out to be true\
[2:05:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7514) but all this would show is that\
[2:05:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7517) materialistic causation is not\
[2:05:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7519) necessarily true it does not refute\
[2:05:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7522) causality\
[2:05:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7523) in and of itself as a metaphysical\
[2:05:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7526) principle\
[2:05:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7527) so if there's no naturalistic causes\
[2:05:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7530) to explain on a quantum level then the\
[2:05:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7533) cause would be\
[2:05:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7534) non-naturalistic yeah and then we're\
[2:05:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7537) getting into the volume and weakness\
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7539) interpretation of quantum mechanics yeah\
[2:05:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7542) so in terms of trinity doesn't work\
[2:05:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7545) because\
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7546) obviously as soon as you observe it or\
[2:05:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7547) you have a measuring device\
[2:05:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7549) it collapses into a particular particle\
[2:05:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7551) or particular location\
[2:05:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7553) and in that situation it's not now\
[2:05:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7557) both a particle and a wave it is how you\
[2:06:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7560) measured it\
[2:06:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7561) that will influence what type of thing\
[2:06:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7564) it will represent yeah or the collapse\
[2:06:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7567) of the wave function\
[2:06:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7568) in that situation so it's not the case\
[2:06:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7571) that they don't follow\
[2:06:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7572) logic quantum level events it's the fact\
[2:06:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7576) that they are counterintuitive to what\
[2:06:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7578) we expect\
[2:06:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7580) yeah so so we still we\
[2:06:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7583) because when we talk about probability\
[2:06:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7585) we're not going outside of logic when we\
[2:06:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7587) use\
[2:06:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7588) quantum mechanics physical equations to\
[2:06:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7591) make certain predictions even if it's\
[2:06:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7594) probabilistic\
[2:06:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7595) it's still following you're still using\
[2:06:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7597) mass and mass\
[2:06:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7598) itself has to is actually built upon the\
[2:06:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7601) axioms of logic\
[2:06:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7602) as well so it's not going outside of\
[2:06:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7605) logic people\
[2:06:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7606) and everything goes back to that first\
[2:06:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7607) sorry that first uh\
[2:06:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7609) caller who said well how can you believe\
[2:06:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7612) in this moon split in\
[2:06:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7614) but at the same time not believe in the\
[2:06:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7615) trinity there are no\
[2:06:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7617) it's not they're not propositionally the\
[2:07:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7620) same thing\
[2:07:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7621) one's a logical we're saying it's a\
[2:07:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7623) logical impossibility\
[2:07:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7624) you know trinity the concept of you know\
[2:07:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7627) three persons one god\
[2:07:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7628) and the other one is a um\
[2:07:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7632) is a logical possibility not saying it's\
[2:07:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7634) it can happen\
[2:07:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7636) but as in like human beings can make\
[2:07:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7637) this happen but it's not something that\
[2:07:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7640) breaks\
[2:07:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7640) logical laws yeah and it just kind of\
[2:07:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7644) um highlight on that comment it's it's\
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7646) not going off topic because it's\
[2:07:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7647) specifically using um we're discussing\
[2:07:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7650) this\
[2:07:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7651) because of the fact that obviously when\
[2:07:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7652) we're talking about the committee we're\
[2:07:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7653) saying that there's a logical problem\
[2:07:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7655) and i've heard this kind of contention\
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7658) be brought up\
[2:07:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7659) um as a reason as to why we can\
[2:07:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7660) disregard logic\
[2:07:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7662) um so discussing this is important\
[2:07:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7665) disregarding logic part just very\
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7667) quickly\
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7667) i mean i mean like when you're talking\
[2:07:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7670) about uh\
[2:07:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7671) like dial atheism i think it's known as\
[2:07:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7673) which which is that true contradictions\
[2:07:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7675) can\
[2:07:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7676) exist i think\
[2:07:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7679) whoever is advocating for that kind of\
[2:08:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7681) view is kind of shooting himself in the\
[2:08:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7682) foot\
[2:08:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7683) in terms of being able to know anything\
[2:08:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7685) in the first place like um\
[2:08:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7687) and and i think like uh what's known as\
[2:08:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7689) the principle of explosion is one of the\
[2:08:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7690) main criticisms of dilutivism that\
[2:08:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7693) just if if true contradictions can exist\
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7696) then\
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7696) literally anything can happen and\
[2:08:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7699) you could you could literally be right\
[2:08:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7701) and wrong at the same time\
[2:08:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7703) so it kind of opens the floodgates to\
[2:08:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7706) like\
[2:08:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7706) a a very radical and unhealthy kind of\
[2:08:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7709) skepticism\
[2:08:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7710) of course there are there are there's\
[2:08:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7713) work\
[2:08:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7714) done by a philosopher named grain priest\
[2:08:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7716) about in\
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7717) para consistent logic where he tries to\
[2:08:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7719) say that he tries to evade this\
[2:08:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7721) uh uh problem of this prince this\
[2:08:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7724) principle of explosion\
[2:08:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7725) uh and and he tries to advocate for the\
[2:08:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7728) reality that that there are true\
[2:08:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7729) contradictions that dilution is true but\
[2:08:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7731) but\
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7732) i mean that's a really huge ontological\
[2:08:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7734) cost to pay\
[2:08:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7736) for for any kind of epistemology you're\
[2:08:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7739) gonna put forward\
[2:09:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7740) and i'm not sure that anyone really\
[2:09:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7742) actually thinks like that i mean so to\
[2:09:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7744) to propose this this this kind of um\
[2:09:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7748) uh uh to propose that the dilutionism is\
[2:09:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7751) true or that true contradictions can\
[2:09:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7752) exist\
[2:09:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7753) in order to just you know get get out of\
[2:09:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7755) a problem\
[2:09:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7756) i think that the the consequences of\
[2:09:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7758) that are huge\
[2:09:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7760) they're really huge because literally\
[2:09:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7763) anything can be right like like in the\
[2:09:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7765) case of the discussion about the trinity\
[2:09:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7766) in islam both islam and christianity can\
[2:09:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7768) be both\
[2:09:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7769) true and false at the same time i mean\
[2:09:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7773) if contradictory statements can be true\
[2:09:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7775) then trinity can be both true and false\
[2:09:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7777) at the same time right\
[2:09:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7778) yeah but yeah yeah i mean by the way\
[2:09:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7781) grand priest\
[2:09:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7782) is from the uk so i mean what does he\
[2:09:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7784) really know anyway\
[2:09:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7786)Laughter
[2:09:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7788) you know just i want to bring justin in\
[2:09:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7790) because justin he made a really\
[2:09:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7791) interesting uh\
[2:09:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7792) point a couple of days ago in a private\
[2:09:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7794) chat that we're having\
[2:09:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7795) uh remember justin you were talking\
[2:09:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7797) about the you know the transcendental\
[2:09:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7799) argument a lot of christians come out\
[2:10:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7800) with\
[2:10:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7801) the idea that how do you know you know\
[2:10:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7803) you can only ground rationality\
[2:10:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7805) in a rational god in essence i don't\
[2:10:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7808) know if you want to explain further what\
[2:10:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7810) you were saying\
[2:10:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7812) because you sort of to abdul rahman said\
[2:10:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7815) well what\
[2:10:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7815) what's your point to what i was saying\
[2:10:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7817) because i mean sometimes when i go off i\
[2:10:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7819) i black out i don't even remember what\
[2:10:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7822) i'm saying\
[2:10:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7823) so you you mentioned so what a number of\
[2:10:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7825) christians do\
[2:10:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7826) and they they argue for even though it's\
[2:10:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7829) not a uniquely christian argument they\
[2:10:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7830) tried to say that\
[2:10:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7832) you can't ground any rational truths\
[2:10:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7835) because as a materialist as an atheist\
[2:10:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7838) because how do you know materialism and\
[2:10:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7840) atheism is leading you to true ideas\
[2:10:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7843) yeah yeah and therefore there must be\
[2:10:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7846) something more than material\
[2:10:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7848) to ground it and they say therefore it\
[2:10:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7850) must be a rational god\
[2:10:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7853) do you remember the argument now that\
[2:10:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7854) you mentioned i i think i remember the\
[2:10:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7856) conversation we were having yeah\
[2:10:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7857) yeah i think you mentioned yeah jake\
[2:11:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7860) yeah i mentioned it to jake i had a\
[2:11:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7861) question that i asked him\
[2:11:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7863) that i thought was a really interesting\
[2:11:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7865) question i'm trying to remember what i\
[2:11:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7866) asked him\
[2:11:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7868) um let me repeat the\
[2:11:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7871) just so the audience knows isn't it so\
[2:11:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7874) you said if trinitarians appeal to\
[2:11:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7878) mystery and say it's\
[2:11:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7879) a logical it's outside the bounds of\
[2:11:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7882) logic\
[2:11:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7884) then they can't ground any logic or\
[2:11:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7887) rationality\
[2:11:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7888) yeah okay okay yeah so they're appealing\
[2:11:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7890) to an\
[2:11:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7891) irrational being to say that we\
[2:11:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7894) therefore have rational ideas\
[2:11:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7897) because they're saying yes you know this\
[2:11:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7898) is how you come to belief in god is\
[2:11:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7900) through this presuppositionist\
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7901) argument but then they're coming to a\
[2:11:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7904) conclusion that there's this\
[2:11:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7905) illogical creator that can literally do\
[2:11:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7908) exist and not exist exist as free people\
[2:11:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7911) but all yeah\
[2:11:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7913) all these such things if you're if your\
[2:11:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7916) rationality comes from god and your god\
[2:11:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7919) holds an irrational or a rational\
[2:12:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7921) position as some of our other\
[2:12:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7922) christian friends would say that the\
[2:12:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7924) trinity is a rational it's just not\
[2:12:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7926) rationable or we can't rationalize\
[2:12:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7929) the conception of the trinity well then\
[2:12:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7932) if your rationality itself your own\
[2:12:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7934) personal rationality comes from that and\
[2:12:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7936) is grounded\
[2:12:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7937) in that idea of god well then how could\
[2:12:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7939) you ever be rational how could you ever\
[2:12:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7941) go out an atheist and say\
[2:12:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7943) well you know you don't have a\
[2:12:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7945) metaphysical uh\
[2:12:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7946) you know grounding or an ultimacy of\
[2:12:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7948) reality for your\
[2:12:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7950) intelligibility how could you ever go at\
[2:12:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7952) somebody\
[2:12:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7953) with with that type of argument when\
[2:12:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7956) yours holds no\
[2:12:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7957) you know your idea how holds no water\
[2:12:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7960) and i mean that's that's something else\
[2:12:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7962) that did happen on the show today just\
[2:12:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7964) to\
[2:12:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7964) tag this along in with that is that our\
[2:12:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7967) first guest your first guest had stated\
[2:12:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7970) that\
[2:12:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7971) well and this happens a lot with\
[2:12:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7972) christians is why are you limiting god\
[2:12:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7975) well i think it's perfectly fine to\
[2:12:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7977) limit god if the bible says so\
[2:13:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7980) the bible says he can't sin he can't lie\
[2:13:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7982) he can't act outside of his nature\
[2:13:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7984) yeah so i mean if if we adhere to all\
[2:13:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7986) these three things what's so wrong about\
[2:13:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7988) limiting god\
[2:13:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7990) like if you're going to say and i think\
[2:13:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7992) sharif you brought up a great point\
[2:13:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7993) if you're going to say that god can\
[2:13:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7996) literally do anything\
[2:13:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=7998) outside apart from logic and he\
[2:13:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8000) transcends logic itself\
[2:13:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8002) well then we literally i i mean my my\
[2:13:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8004) flying spaghetti monster has immaterial\
[2:13:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8006) pasta\
[2:13:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8007) and and he can do whatever he wants\
[2:13:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8009) whenever he wants\
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8010) and also not do it simultaneously so\
[2:13:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8014) that he knows but he doesn't know\
[2:13:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8016) and you could just you could just make\
[2:13:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8017) this completely absurd statement\
[2:13:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8019) and then if if you're if you're making a\
[2:13:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8022) claim that i believe in christianity\
[2:13:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8024) and not this immaterial noodle flying\
[2:13:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8026) spaghetti monster thing\
[2:13:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8027) well then what methodology do you use to\
[2:13:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8030) figure out which one of them actually\
[2:13:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8032) exists\
[2:13:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8032) and which one of them doesn't that this\
[2:13:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8034) is the biggest problem i think with this\
[2:13:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8036) claim because it sort of undermines any\
[2:13:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8037) apologetics\
[2:13:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8038) any apologetic attempts like how if if\
[2:14:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8042) you can say\
[2:14:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8042) anything about god how on earth like\
[2:14:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8044) what's the how\
[2:14:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8045) is anyone meant to be able to\
[2:14:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8047) distinguish the truth between say\
[2:14:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8049) hinduism and\
[2:14:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8049) christianity or conversation\
[2:14:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8053) you can't yeah and that's one of the\
[2:14:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8055) most frustrating things as well because\
[2:14:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8056) it\
[2:14:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8057) it kind of it again it shoots itself in\
[2:14:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8060) the foot it's like\
[2:14:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8061) uh you know that we can say anything and\
[2:14:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8064) you know it's uh possibly true but then\
[2:14:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8067) it's like\
[2:14:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8068) we kept making particular claims and\
[2:14:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8069) they were always wrong\
[2:14:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8071) it's like well you're you're still stuck\
[2:14:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8073) in this binary thinking\
[2:14:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8074) of something can be true and something\
[2:14:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8076) can be false because you're not allowing\
[2:14:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8078) us to make\
[2:14:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8079) any claims and you're you're completely\
[2:14:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8080) removing that\
[2:14:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8082) from the realm of possibility and you're\
[2:14:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8084) saying no blah blah blah\
[2:14:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8085) and as well i don't think it's so much\
[2:14:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8088) as\
[2:14:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8088) us putting limits on god but when we're\
[2:14:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8090) talking about what's logical we're\
[2:14:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8092) talking about inferences from state one\
[2:14:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8094) statement to the next\
[2:14:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8095) and whether these differences are valid\
[2:14:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8097) we're not talking about\
[2:14:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8099) like a graph like gravity some force\
[2:15:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8102) external on the world\
[2:15:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8103) acting upon you we're talking about\
[2:15:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8105) whether or not your inferences\
[2:15:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8107) are valid that is does it is there you\
[2:15:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8109) know like\
[2:15:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8110) can you just make a claim a a claim b\
[2:15:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8112) and then a claim c\
[2:15:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8114) if there is no connection between them\
[2:15:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8115) like yeah proposition one\
[2:15:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8118) i have a potato proposition two i also\
[2:15:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8121) like cheesecake\
[2:15:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8122) conclusion therefore dave down the road\
[2:15:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8125) is a murderer no it's like\
[2:15:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8127) these invalid infants\
[2:15:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8130) and saying that such a thing is absurd\
[2:15:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8132) is not to say that there is\
[2:15:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8134) limits on people like gravity pushes\
[2:15:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8136) down on you\
[2:15:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8137) or you know the the law um\
[2:15:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8140) you need to make it yeah you need to\
[2:15:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8142) make a coherent\
[2:15:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8144) statement isn't it the words that you're\
[2:15:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8147) using have to be coherent\
[2:15:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8148) so if i turn around and i say can god\
[2:15:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8150) create a squared circle\
[2:15:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8152) yeah and i say is that a coherent\
[2:15:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8155) statement\
[2:15:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8156) yeah is it are we limiting god by saying\
[2:16:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8160) god\
[2:16:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8160) cannot create a squared circle no\
[2:16:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8163) because we're saying the statement\
[2:16:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8164) itself is not coherent\
[2:16:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8166) it's meaning meaningless you're not\
[2:16:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8168) talking about something\
[2:16:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8170) and so but and so this is the\
[2:16:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8172) distinction i think people\
[2:16:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8174) they don't get their head around when\
[2:16:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8175) they start to use this whole or you're\
[2:16:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8177) limiting god\
[2:16:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8178) because you're saying uh that he can't\
[2:16:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8179) do something illogical\
[2:16:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8181) no when we're saying something's\
[2:16:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8182) illogical we're saying that the\
[2:16:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8183) statement itself is absurd\
[2:16:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8185) meaning yeah that is completely\
[2:16:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8187) meaningless and what you're referring to\
[2:16:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8188) isn't a thing it's like if you tell me\
[2:16:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8191) go up to the stairs down the stairs\
[2:16:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8195) i'm going to be like what are you on\
[2:16:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8196) about what are you trying to tell me to\
[2:16:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8198) do here\
[2:16:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8199) do you want me to go up the stairs or do\
[2:16:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8201) you want me to go down the stairs and\
[2:16:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8202) like what you want about go\
[2:16:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8203) up the stairs down the stairs like no no\
[2:16:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8205) you you're not\
[2:16:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8206) saying anything you're not with you're\
[2:16:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8209) just making noises at this point it's\
[2:16:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8210) there's nothing clear here with the with\
[2:16:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8213) the first guest that you guys had\
[2:16:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8214) jake had made a really good point and i\
[2:16:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8217) almost ended up breaking my nose i\
[2:16:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8219) palm so hard just because jake had asked\
[2:17:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8222) he said\
[2:17:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8223) he said um do you believe\
[2:17:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8227) that that god can choose to stop\
[2:17:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8230) existing yeah and the guy said yeah yeah\
[2:17:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8234) he can\
[2:17:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8235) and i'm like earlier in the conversation\
[2:17:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8237) you just said that\
[2:17:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8238) god's eternality was a necessary\
[2:17:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8242) uh property of his existence so\
[2:17:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8246) what do you what do you even mean by\
[2:17:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8248) that now like yeah\
[2:17:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8249) it it didn't make any sense i was i i\
[2:17:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8253) i i could notice it right off the bat\
[2:17:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8255) and i was like wondering how\
[2:17:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8257) he didn't he didn't notice that he just\
[2:17:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8259) did that\
[2:17:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8260) yeah when i appealed to when i appealed\
[2:17:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8262) to the bible\
[2:17:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8263) uh he started getting upset in the\
[2:17:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8265) beginning he said yeah well bible i\
[2:17:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8267) believe hundred percent and then when we\
[2:17:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8269) started going in the bible\
[2:17:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8270) well you know there it could be daif\
[2:17:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8273) like\
[2:17:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8274) week week it could be like a week\
[2:17:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8276) narration like what are we talking about\
[2:17:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8278) and i\
[2:17:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8279) i didn't even get a chance to really\
[2:18:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8281) read but i mean just\
[2:18:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8282) one scripture in hebrews 6 18 which he\
[2:18:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8285) didn't want to go to\
[2:18:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8287) it says so that by two unchangeable\
[2:18:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8289) things\
[2:18:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8290) in which it is impossible for god to lie\
[2:18:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8294) we who have fled for refuge might have\
[2:18:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8296) strong encouragement to hold fast to the\
[2:18:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8298) hope set before us\
[2:18:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8300) but the point is the verse says that\
[2:18:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8302) it's impossible for god to lie\
[2:18:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8304) and there's a couple other passages that\
[2:18:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8306) pretty much say the same thing but\
[2:18:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8307) to be fair just so we don't put words in\
[2:18:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8310) his mouth and straw man him\
[2:18:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8312) i think you initially misheard him\
[2:18:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8314) because he said he\
[2:18:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8315) doesn't he doesn't have to believe 100\
[2:18:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8318) with us so i think that's what he was\
[2:18:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8319) saying\
[2:18:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8320) okay uh and we were dealing with with\
[2:18:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8322) with uh someone who doesn't really\
[2:18:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8324) like he isn't really uh doesn't really\
[2:18:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8326) think the scripture is infallible or\
[2:18:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8327) something\
[2:18:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8328) and this is the thing yeah how do you\
[2:18:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8330) determine what part of the scripture you\
[2:18:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8332) can accept and what part you can reject\
[2:18:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8334) like yeah at least like for example with\
[2:18:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8336) the hadith um\
[2:18:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8337) we've got a very strict way of\
[2:19:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8340) approaching it\
[2:19:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8341) you know there's the train of\
[2:19:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8341) transmission and we have to have\
[2:19:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8343) knowledge about the people within the\
[2:19:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8345) transmission\
[2:19:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8346) what kind of people were they like were\
[2:19:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8347) they known to be liars where they know\
[2:19:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8349) this\
[2:19:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8349) that's why it was difficult to have the\
[2:19:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8351) discussion because if you say that you\
[2:19:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8352) don't i mean i was i was hoping he says\
[2:19:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8354) that he does accept what the bible says\
[2:19:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8356) a hundred percent of time\
[2:19:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8357) because then at least you have some\
[2:19:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8358) basis to work with\
[2:19:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8360) like you can you can tell yeah and even\
[2:19:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8362) if he was going to reject\
[2:19:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8364) the bible in some instances so explain\
[2:19:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8366) to us what it is\
[2:19:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8368) that allows you like how do you\
[2:19:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8370) determine what parts of the bible you're\
[2:19:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8371) supposed to be rejecting\
[2:19:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8373) because like he's logically impossible\
[2:19:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8376) yeah yeah because he's still\
[2:19:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8379) he was still using that made sense to\
[2:19:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8381) the mind\
[2:19:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8383) or that which came into conflict with\
[2:19:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8384) the position that he was putting forward\
[2:19:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8386) but it's like well if you know\
[2:19:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8390) it it becomes impossible to have a\
[2:19:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8391) conversation at that point because\
[2:19:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8393) anything you say that comes into\
[2:19:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8395) conflict is just like logic doesn't\
[2:19:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8396) matter\
[2:19:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8397) and so long as it's reinforcing his\
[2:19:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8399) position logic is then\
[2:20:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8400) reinstated again and it's like you're\
[2:20:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8403) picking and choosing it and there's no\
[2:20:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8406) clear explanation as to when that mode\
[2:20:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8409) has been flipped or why\
[2:20:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8410) it just happens when it happens to be in\
[2:20:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8413) conflict and\
[2:20:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8413) and the whole problem is that it's\
[2:20:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8415) presupposing the thing that it's trying\
[2:20:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8417) to deny\
[2:20:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8418) it's saying at this point it just\
[2:20:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8420) becomes unfair because\
[2:20:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8421) he's allowed to switch between using\
[2:20:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8423) logic and not having any\
[2:20:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8425) logical um well i think i i think it's\
[2:20:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8428) basically in this this\
[2:20:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8430) is what narrows it down is that the\
[2:20:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8432) methodology\
[2:20:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8433) that he used to in what i think most\
[2:20:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8436) people that i've interacted with\
[2:20:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8438) um religious wise um and i'll say this\
[2:20:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8441) as an atheist you know most people that\
[2:20:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8443) i've come in contact with\
[2:20:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8445) they will deny and not not everybody but\
[2:20:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8448) some will deny\
[2:20:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8450) the parts of the bible that they\
[2:20:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8451) personally don't accept like\
[2:20:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8453) that's why you find christians that\
[2:20:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8455) accept homosexuality\
[2:20:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8457) and that think that it's perfectly fine\
[2:20:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8459) they they find they take those\
[2:21:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8461) scripture the scripture that speaks\
[2:21:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8463) against homosexuality and says oh we\
[2:21:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8464) don't need to pay attention to that\
[2:21:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8466) yeah there's an interesting back and\
[2:21:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8469) forth with\
[2:21:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8470) that ip guy what's his name inspired\
[2:21:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8472) philosophy\
[2:21:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8473) and uh basically like there was this\
[2:21:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8475) whole issue about um\
[2:21:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8477) the capital punishment for apostates in\
[2:21:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8480) islam\
[2:21:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8480) and he's setting himself up with like\
[2:21:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8482) anyone who holds this position is an\
[2:21:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8484) enemy of me\
[2:21:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8485) and we tried pointing out like listen\
[2:21:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8487) the old testament\
[2:21:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8489) is quite explicit here look at\
[2:21:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8491) deuteronomy\
[2:21:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8492) you know it's it's you can't really what\
[2:21:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8494) else can you say about this there's no\
[2:21:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8495) ambiguity here it's quite\
[2:21:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8497) clear-cut statements and he went to this\
[2:21:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8500) whole um\
[2:21:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8501) idea of the old testament was not\
[2:21:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8503) legislative that it was\
[2:21:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8505) he referred to as wisdom literature and\
[2:21:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8507) uh\
[2:21:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8508) which is really funny because like he he\
[2:21:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8511) the\
[2:21:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8511) particular verses he was bringing up um\
[2:21:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8513) were from the new testament but there\
[2:21:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8515) was also a verse\
[2:21:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8516) in the new testament um where jesus says\
[2:21:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8518) to make sure you follow\
[2:22:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8520) the uh what they call the philippians\
[2:22:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8523) who are the or the philistines what\
[2:22:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8525) didn't it well i can't remember the\
[2:22:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8531) do what the pharisees say um but don't\
[2:22:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8534) imitate how they act because they say\
[2:22:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8536) things but don't you know they're\
[2:22:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8537) hypocrites they don't do these things\
[2:22:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8538) and so it's making\
[2:22:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8539) it quite explicitly you're to follow the\
[2:22:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8542) law\
[2:22:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8543) and that you know it's referring to it\
[2:22:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8544) as law in the new testament with the old\
[2:22:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8546) testament\
[2:22:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8546) and so you can you can't escape this\
[2:22:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8549) idea that the old testament was\
[2:22:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8550) legislative\
[2:22:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8552) um but obviously like in order to hold\
[2:22:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8555) these certain things\
[2:22:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8556) and be able to say certain things that\
[2:22:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8557) are abhorrent you have to somehow\
[2:22:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8560) explain away the old testament\
[2:22:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8562) and this seems like a very convenient\
[2:22:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8563) way to do so just to refer to it\
[2:22:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8565) as wisdom literature as stories\
[2:22:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8567) something that the\
[2:22:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8568) um you know the original jews they never\
[2:22:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8571) they never took it as legislative\
[2:22:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8573) when you know you know within the\
[2:22:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8576) literature it's quite clear because at\
[2:22:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8578) this point it's like well what are you\
[2:22:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8579) considering\
[2:23:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8580) the stories about moses and things like\
[2:23:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8581) that are these just stories did moses\
[2:23:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8584) not exist was he\
[2:23:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8585) or was he not a prophet and if if the\
[2:23:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8587) new testament\
[2:23:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8588) is all kind of um saying that this is\
[2:23:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8592) truth this is truth and\
[2:23:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8593) the new testament is being predicted by\
[2:23:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8595) the old testament everything that is\
[2:23:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8596) going to come in the new testament\
[2:23:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8598) um is is clarified it's like well if\
[2:23:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8600) this is just wisdom literature\
[2:23:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8602) and it's you know it's not necessarily\
[2:23:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8604) got anything it's just stories to find\
[2:23:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8606) nice little morals in blah blah blah how\
[2:23:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8609) are you then\
[2:23:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8610) rooting the new testament in it like\
[2:23:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8612) yeah it gets uh\
[2:23:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8614) really weird but it's interesting\
[2:23:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8616) because uh\
[2:23:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8617) we were having a conversation with a\
[2:23:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8619) couple christians i think it was\
[2:23:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8621) yesterday\
[2:23:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8621) i think justin was there and we were\
[2:23:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8624) being told the exact\
[2:23:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8625) opposite that deuteronomy was the law\
[2:23:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8628) book of the jews\
[2:23:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8629) like it wasn't wisdom literature it was\
[2:23:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8632) the law book for the jews so\
[2:23:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8634) it's interesting that um you know\
[2:23:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8637) christians have a different perspective\
[2:23:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8639) i think the fact that it was a law book\
[2:24:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8641) for the jews is\
[2:24:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8642) actually what it was much more\
[2:24:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8644) consistently the second\
[2:24:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8646) last thing i want to point out about the\
[2:24:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8648) whole um\
[2:24:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8649) quantum physics thing is that look any\
[2:24:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8652) anybody who's using quantum physics as a\
[2:24:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8656) sort of\
[2:24:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8656) argument to explain another thing that\
[2:24:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8659) is apparently\
[2:24:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8661) unexplainable or mysterious that should\
[2:24:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8663) be a tip\
[2:24:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8664) off that there's an issue because you're\
[2:24:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8667) using quantum mechanics which\
[2:24:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8669) is a a thing that right now\
[2:24:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8673) is mysterious even to quantum physicists\
[2:24:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8676) and you're using that as an analogy\
[2:24:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8679) to explain the incomprehensible nature\
[2:24:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8682) of god\
[2:24:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8683) or these apparent contradictions that\
[2:24:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8685) you can't explain\
[2:24:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8686) well and i'm not just putting that on\
[2:24:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8688) trinitarians because\
[2:24:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8690) other people use quantum physics in this\
[2:24:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8693) way\
[2:24:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8693) to try to be honest i have used it\
[2:24:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8695) myself to argue against determinism\
[2:24:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8697) yeah i i just think and muslims have\
[2:25:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8700) used it and i'm not bashing brother\
[2:25:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8701) yusuf now but\
[2:25:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8702) i i just think that we shouldn't be\
[2:25:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8704) using that for\
[2:25:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8706) really any major point at this point\
[2:25:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8709) anyway because\
[2:25:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8710) i agree there's so many different\
[2:25:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8711) there's so many different\
[2:25:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8712) interpretations of it we don't really\
[2:25:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8714) know what the right one is or how to\
[2:25:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8716) understand\
[2:25:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8717) what's happening here so to use that\
[2:25:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8721) as a sort of anchor point for\
[2:25:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8724) the mysterious nature of god\
[2:25:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8728) and trying to alleviate these apparent\
[2:25:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8730) contradictions\
[2:25:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8731) uh in the trinity i think it's just\
[2:25:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8734) really\
[2:25:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8734) wrong-headed in a bad way of approaching\
[2:25:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8736) the topic\
[2:25:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8738) and to be honest i agree that um i have\
[2:25:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8740) changed my position and\
[2:25:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8741) to be honest the only time i really use\
[2:25:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8743) quantum mechanics is like a way of\
[2:25:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8744) trying to\
[2:25:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8745) um deal with this idea that logic is\
[2:25:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8749) is binding or anything i i had when i\
[2:25:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8751) ended up looking into bowling mechanics\
[2:25:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8752) i had to kind of let that go and i was\
[2:25:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8754) like i clearly don't really know\
[2:25:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8756) too much about all of this uh it's quite\
[2:25:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8758) a mysterious subject field and\
[2:25:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8759) it's probably not going to um be\
[2:26:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8761) fruitful to kind of bring it up in any\
[2:26:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8763) way\
[2:26:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8763) go on justin before before we wrap up i\
[2:26:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8766) just have a question\
[2:26:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8768) why does the guy with the best looking\
[2:26:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8770) beard is the only non-muslim in the room\
[2:26:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8773) watch your mouth\
[2:26:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8776) well it's a sign that you're gonna have\
[2:26:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8778) to take your shahada then bro cause\
[2:26:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8780) we we can't have you roaming around with\
[2:26:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8782) such a glorious beard\
[2:26:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8783) hey hey just uh just this morning i\
[2:26:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8786) finished up avocado\
[2:26:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8787) and i moved on to uh uh sutter three\
[2:26:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8791) so i'm reading that and uh and like i\
[2:26:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8794) said i've\
[2:26:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8794) i've gotten down 114 down pat now um i\
[2:26:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8798) i think so so that's the let's say you\
[2:26:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8800) go for it again\
[2:26:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8803) putting them on the spot\
[2:26:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8811)Music
[2:27:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8820) oh\
[2:27:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8829)Music
[2:27:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8841) the fact that even when i'm putting you\
[2:27:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8842) on the spot you're still\
[2:27:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8844) you're dealing with it well so yeah good\
[2:27:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8847) job\
[2:27:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8848) keep it up and also learning you know\
[2:27:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8850) what\
[2:27:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8852) it actually means because like just the\
[2:27:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8853) other day we were having a conversation\
[2:27:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8855) as i go through the surahs um\
[2:27:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8858) i have questions about certain things\
[2:27:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8860) like talk to jake about uh\
[2:27:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8863) iblis and and what exactly lisa is and\
[2:27:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8866) you know um\
[2:27:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8868) talked about uh zarat is that is that\
[2:27:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8871) am i saying that correctly the uh\
[2:27:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8874) obligatory\
[2:27:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8876) uh\
[2:28:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8882) obligatory charity that you have to give\
[2:28:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8884) uh i i guess the\
[2:28:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8886) at the end of i think it's like i uh 283\
[2:28:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8890) i think it is\
[2:28:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8891) um it states that you know when signing\
[2:28:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8893) for a loan and you have the scribe you\
[2:28:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8895) know that's writing down the loan\
[2:28:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8897) you need to have two male witnesses and\
[2:28:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8900) if you if you don't have two male\
[2:28:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8902) witnesses and you only have one\
[2:28:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8904) then you need to grab two female\
[2:28:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8906) witnesses\
[2:28:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8908) to make up for the one male witness\
[2:28:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8910) that's not there\
[2:28:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8911) and me as like a humanist i'm like all\
[2:28:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8914) about equality i'm like\
[2:28:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8915) well why do you need two females to make\
[2:28:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8917) up for one dude like come on\
[2:28:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8919) but uh you know like i said i'm not\
[2:28:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8921) going to argue against it because i mean\
[2:28:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8922) this was the understanding at the time\
[2:28:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8925) just like you know you know when the\
[2:28:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8927) christians argue with slavery\
[2:28:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8929) i don't argue moral issues with the\
[2:28:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8931) bible anymore i think it's\
[2:28:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8933) pointless especially for my position as\
[2:28:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8935) a moral nihilist\
[2:28:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8937) and a heart determinist why why do i why\
[2:29:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8940) would i even\
[2:29:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8941) like argue morality with anybody i i\
[2:29:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8944) know you\
[2:29:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8944) you you mentioned this before as well in\
[2:29:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8946) the court but i wasn't able to answer it\
[2:29:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8949) but just really quickly um people use\
[2:29:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8952) these particular verses and rulings\
[2:29:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8954) and try to generalize and that's the\
[2:29:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8956) problem because\
[2:29:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8958) many times there are many other\
[2:29:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8960) incidents\
[2:29:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8961) instances in which the witness testimony\
[2:29:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8965) of a woman is greater than that of a man\
[2:29:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8967) and in the normal situation it's equal\
[2:29:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8969) to the other man\
[2:29:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8971) yeah and in terms of like you know when\
[2:29:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8973) we talk about hadith\
[2:29:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8974) and we classify hadith it's irrespective\
[2:29:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8978) whether it's a male or a female that's\
[2:29:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8980) narrating the hadith\
[2:29:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8981) they're considered equal yeah that's to\
[2:29:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8984) do with\
[2:29:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8984) the source of the deen it's a source of\
[2:29:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8987) that's cool that's cool\
[2:29:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8988) yeah so my question would be why do we\
[2:29:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8990) need\
[2:29:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8991) two females so one of them being in\
[2:29:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8994) place yeah\
[2:29:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8995) yeah so there might be a couple of\
[2:29:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8997) explanations for it obviously\
[2:29:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=8998) god knows best as to why he made this um\
[2:30:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9001) particular distinction\
[2:30:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9002) for example he was making mention of the\
[2:30:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9003) hadith there uh so\
[2:30:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9005) um she uh\
[2:30:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9008) related probably the most i think\
[2:30:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9010) correct me from wrong hadith\
[2:30:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9012) than anybody and we didn't require\
[2:30:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9016) after every\
[2:30:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9020) and this verse wasn't applied in this\
[2:30:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9022) context so with regards to things like\
[2:30:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9024) um contracts for loans and money that\
[2:30:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9026) you you can look at modern\
[2:30:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9028) um so in sweden it's the most\
[2:30:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9031) egalitarian place in the world and\
[2:30:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9035) uh they they based this assumption that\
[2:30:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9037) if we uh remove\
[2:30:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9038) all these restrictions in society that\
[2:30:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9041) the male and female will end up\
[2:30:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9042) acting the same and they'll be making\
[2:30:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9044) the same decisions and they'll be doing\
[2:30:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9045) this\
[2:30:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9046) and that and that you'll just see like a\
[2:30:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9048) correlation 50 50\
[2:30:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9050) in every subject field now in the\
[2:30:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9052) attempt to make\
[2:30:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9053) the society more egalitarian and remove\
[2:30:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9055) these restrictions\
[2:30:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9056) what you end up seeing is the gender\
[2:30:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9057) differences start to accentuate even\
[2:31:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9060) further\
[2:31:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9061) and their women are acting are doing\
[2:31:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9064) things that are more\
[2:31:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9065) female orientated or you know\
[2:31:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9067) stereotypically\
[2:31:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9068) and males are doing things more male\
[2:31:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9071) orientated stereotypically\
[2:31:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9073) and despite the fact so it seemed not\
[2:31:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9076) it was counterintuitive to what they\
[2:31:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9078) assumed the restrictions in society\
[2:31:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9080) weren't\
[2:31:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9080) stopping the genders from becoming more\
[2:31:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9083) the same\
[2:31:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9084) it was having the opposite effect it was\
[2:31:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9086) stopping them from becoming more\
[2:31:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9087) different and\
[2:31:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9088) and then funnily enough as well if you\
[2:31:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9089) go to places like egypt or um\
[2:31:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9092) morocco they have a higher uh rate of\
[2:31:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9094) gender equality in\
[2:31:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9096) the stem fields or like you have more\
[2:31:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9098) women applying for stem fields subjects\
[2:31:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9100) in places that are arab countries and\
[2:31:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9102) you do in more egalitarian places like\
[2:31:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9104) in\
[2:31:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9104) northern europe so with this bringing it\
[2:31:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9107) back to the point as to why there may be\
[2:31:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9109) a need for\
[2:31:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9110) more female witnesses when it comes to\
[2:31:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9112) for example financial transactions\
[2:31:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9114) might just be more to do with the fact\
[2:31:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9115) that male and female have different\
[2:31:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9118) interests\
[2:31:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9119) and when you come to financial\
[2:32:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9121) transactions and things like that\
[2:32:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9123) it's maybe much more likely the case\
[2:32:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9125) that a male might be more interested in\
[2:32:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9126) that sort of subject field\
[2:32:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9128) and uh with regards to obviously we have\
[2:32:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9130) segregation\
[2:32:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9131) policies as well so if there's two\
[2:32:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9134) female witnesses\
[2:32:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9134) they can obviously discuss things in\
[2:32:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9136) private and um there's less\
[2:32:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9138) controversy surrounding i guess my only\
[2:32:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9140) question was what is the relevance of\
[2:32:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9142) the interest of witnesses they are only\
[2:32:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9144) simply there to witness something not\
[2:32:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9146) give what they're interested about\
[2:32:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9148) no no no it's i think what it is is that\
[2:32:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9150) what uh joseph was mentioned earlier is\
[2:32:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9152) that\
[2:32:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9153) historically in terms of the arab world\
[2:32:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9156) in that time\
[2:32:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9157) the women weren't engaged in financial\
[2:32:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9159) dealings yeah so they weren't aware of\
[2:32:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9161) these types of things\
[2:32:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9163) and so although this is not a legal\
[2:32:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9165) reasoning behind the particular\
[2:32:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9167) ruling on this issue this is what people\
[2:32:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9170) have\
[2:32:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9171) discussed as a context behind this\
[2:32:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9172) particular rule that the context\
[2:32:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9174) was that this was things that wasn't\
[2:32:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9178) naturally known to the women that's why\
[2:33:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9181) what you find is that those things which\
[2:33:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9183) are naturally known to women\
[2:33:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9185) like for example uh suckling of mothers\
[2:33:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9188) you know in islam if i just read about\
[2:33:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9191) that yeah\
[2:33:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9192) right okay yeah so if a woman gives\
[2:33:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9194) suckle\
[2:33:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9195) to a child then they become like mother\
[2:33:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9198) and\
[2:33:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9198) child basically yeah they they become\
[2:33:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9202) unmarriageable yeah as an example now in\
[2:33:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9205) this situation the testimony of a woman\
[2:33:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9208) yeah is considered greater than\
[2:33:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9211) the testimony of a man so there was an\
[2:33:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9214) incident in time the prophet peace be\
[2:33:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9216) upon him\
[2:33:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9217) in which uh a woman claimed that she\
[2:33:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9220) had given breast milk to two people a\
[2:33:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9223) male and a female\
[2:33:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9224) who wanted to get married yeah and the\
[2:33:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9226) islamic law is\
[2:33:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9227) not allowed for them to get married now\
[2:33:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9229) they're considered like brother and\
[2:33:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9230) sister in milk\
[2:33:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9231) yeah there's no again reasoning behind\
[2:33:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9233) it's just one of\
[2:33:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9234) the rulings within islam and they\
[2:33:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9238) the man said she's lying the woman's\
[2:34:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9240) lying\
[2:34:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9241) and the prophet said irrespective her\
[2:34:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9244) testimony can't be rejected unless you\
[2:34:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9246) proved the like\
[2:34:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9248) so the testimony of the woman was taken\
[2:34:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9251) over that of the man\
[2:34:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9252) because in that particular area she had\
[2:34:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9255) expertise\
[2:34:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9256) so that's what i'm saying is it's not in\
[2:34:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9259) islam the general relation\
[2:34:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9261) obviously we can do a for podcast on\
[2:34:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9263) this but the general ruling\
[2:34:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9265) is that men and women are generally\
[2:34:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9268) treated equally as a default position\
[2:34:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9271) they are considered equal in terms of\
[2:34:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9273) self-worth as human beings\
[2:34:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9275) and equal access to salvation where the\
[2:34:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9278) natures differ\
[2:34:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9280) then there are different rulings to help\
[2:34:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9282) complement the family structure\
[2:34:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9284) and society at large they're not in\
[2:34:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9286) competition and so\
[2:34:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9288) there are certain rules that will favor\
[2:34:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9289) men in certain respects\
[2:34:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9291) and there'll be other rules that will\
[2:34:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9292) favor women in other respects yeah\
[2:34:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9295) therefore it's not the case of\
[2:34:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9297) generalization from a specific set of\
[2:35:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9300) rulings\
[2:35:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9301) sorry we've gone on a bit for that one\
[2:35:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9303) yeah we'll wrap up here\
[2:35:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9305) isn't it a closing comment there so yeah\
[2:35:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9307) the biggest issue is when people they\
[2:35:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9308) take this comment\
[2:35:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9309) and they assume that it can be\
[2:35:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9310) generalized to all contexts in all\
[2:35:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9313) circumstances\
[2:35:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9314) even though the verse itself is\
[2:35:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9315) extremely specific with regards to when\
[2:35:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9318) the double testimony is required\
[2:35:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9320) and then obviously if you're making the\
[2:35:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9322) claim that oh well there's inequality\
[2:35:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9324) here but in another instance of females\
[2:35:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9326) testimony is worth more than males then\
[2:35:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9328) it's like well\
[2:35:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9330) maybe there's a problem with your\
[2:35:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9332) perception here you're holding it and\
[2:35:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9333) focusing on this problem\
[2:35:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9334) but you completely neglect the opposite\
[2:35:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9336) and then obviously just just to be clear\
[2:35:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9338) i don't want you guys to think that i\
[2:35:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9340) was trying to like argue no no no\
[2:35:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9342) no when i was when i was when i was\
[2:35:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9343) mentioning yeah\
[2:35:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9345) no i get you okay when i didn't want to\
[2:35:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9346) make you feel like i was\
[2:35:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9348) aiming about you i meant with people\
[2:35:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9350) that bring this up vindictively\
[2:35:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9352) in order to discredit uh the prophet\
[2:35:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9353) muhammad sallallahu salaam or the quran\
[2:35:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9355) or\
[2:35:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9356) islam in general it's um it ends up\
[2:35:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9357) being a double standard\
[2:35:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9359) uh they neglect um context and that the\
[2:36:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9361) the verse itself is very specific\
[2:36:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9363) to a particular i think i think it's i\
[2:36:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9365) think it's a fair question to be honest\
[2:36:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9367) and\
[2:36:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9367) it is it is there's a lot more to be\
[2:36:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9369) said about it a lot more\
[2:36:11](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9371) like back and forth to be had about it\
[2:36:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9372) but like it's a huge can of worms to\
[2:36:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9375) open\
[2:36:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9375) like i just want to add like at the end\
[2:36:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9379) for the end of the show i have not yet\
[2:36:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9381) come across a verse\
[2:36:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9383) that tells muslims to go kill people\
[2:36:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9386) for fun yeah you're not going to come\
[2:36:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9387) across that person\
[2:36:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9389) i i told you that again you're not going\
[2:36:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9392) yeah yeah let's believe\
[2:36:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9398) a broader discussion about this in a\
[2:36:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9400) future stream yeah definitely we can\
[2:36:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9402) even have a focus on that\
[2:36:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9403) you know um maybe the next one we can do\
[2:36:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9407) the moral streams or something\
[2:36:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9411) focus on that question itself like our\
[2:36:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9412) muslims kill\
[2:36:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9414) all the disbelievers and we can bring up\
[2:36:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9416) the the argument so why this is an\
[2:36:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9417) absurd claim\
[2:36:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9418) but um we'll leave that there so i just\

[2:38:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9492) with the algorithms for youtube\
[2:38:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9495) as far as the question today that we\
[2:38:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9496) tried to answer does the trinity make\
[2:38:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9498) sense\
[2:38:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9499) um obviously the four of us well five of\
[2:38:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9502) us i don't want to leave out\
[2:38:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9503) the big beard that fell over there um\
[2:38:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9505) five of us\
[2:38:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9506) mr glorious bid yeah no the trinity\
[2:38:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9509) doesn't make sense uh\
[2:38:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9510) we had two christian guests come on and\
[2:38:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9512) um i think\
[2:38:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9514) uh you know they tried their best in\
[2:38:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9516) their own way but\
[2:38:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9517) ultimately uh we don't think that they\
[2:38:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9520) gave adequate answers\
[2:38:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9522) to you know trying to demonstrate that\
[2:38:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9524) the community does make sense\
[2:38:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9526) um but you know other than that maybe\
[2:38:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9529) we'll revisit the issue at another point\
[2:38:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9531) and have some more people on\
[2:38:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9533) but i think it was a beneficial\
[2:38:54](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9534) discussion\
[2:38:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9536) don't forget my argument wasn't refuted\
[2:39:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9541) by the way dude you need to stop having\
[2:39:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9542) your podcast at stupid o'clock in the\
[2:39:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9544) morning if you want us to bloody join up\
[2:39:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9546) over here oh\
[2:39:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9547) i'll just go ahead and move i'll move on\
[2:39:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9549) next door to you and then whatever\
[2:39:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9552) the uk and then we'll be fine and then\
[2:39:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9554) and then sharif won't keep telling me\
[2:39:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9556) that i'm avoiding him\
[2:39:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9557) for three in the morning it's not\
[2:39:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9559) reasonable you've not added me yeah\
[2:39:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9560) you've not added me\
[2:39:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9562) yet do you want to have any closing\
[2:39:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9565) statements\
[2:39:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9567) um i i just wanted to say uh like\
[2:39:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9570) generally again i mentioned this in the\
[2:39:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9572) beginning i want to mention it at the\
[2:39:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9573) end\
[2:39:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9574) that that uh that yeah that the whole\
[2:39:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9577) point of this\
[2:39:38](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9578) is to is to i think a lot of christians\
[2:39:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9580) do acknowledge that there is a logical\
[2:39:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9581) problem there is a discussion to be had\
[2:39:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9584) uh the fact that there is an apparent\
[2:39:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9586) problem doesn't mean that it's an actual\
[2:39:47](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9587) problem we obviously think that\
[2:39:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9589) that it's an actual problem and that's\
[2:39:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9590) what we're arguing for and the whole\
[2:39:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9592) idea is to have a healthy\
[2:39:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9595) discussion about that even if it is a\
[2:39:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9597) logical problem i think a lot of\
[2:39:59](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9599) christians say that you can have\
[2:40:01](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9601) independent reasons to believe in this\
[2:40:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9605) seemingly incoherent uh belief obviously\
[2:40:08](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9608) we're gonna think that\
[2:40:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9609) the the reason and the the logic that\
[2:40:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9612) both muslims and christians agree is god\
[2:40:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9615) given\
[2:40:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9615) should take precedence over these other\
[2:40:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9618) reasons which i think\
[2:40:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9619) christians are generally going to refer\
[2:40:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9620) to scriptural and historical\
[2:40:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9622) reasons for for their beliefs and the\
[2:40:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9625) fact that there is a discussion to be\
[2:40:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9627) had\
[2:40:28](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9628) among christians like there are\
[2:40:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9630) unitarian christians\
[2:40:31](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9631) who give scriptural evidence for their\
[2:40:33](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9633) unit for their unitarian belief\
[2:40:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9635) uh the fact that there is a discussion\
[2:40:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9637) to be had means that you can\
[2:40:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9639) avoid such huge ontological metaphysical\
[2:40:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9643) costs\
[2:40:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9645) in your faith and and it means that\
[2:40:48](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9648) maybe you should consider taking your\
[2:40:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9650) god-given reason\
[2:40:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9652) uh you should give it precedence over uh\
[2:40:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9655) over other forms of let's say\
[2:40:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9657) testimony that that that uh you know\
[2:41:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9660) wouldn't\
[2:41:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9660) wouldn't you know wait as much as reason\
[2:41:03](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9663) in this discussion so i think i'll leave\
[2:41:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9664) it at that\
[2:41:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9666) so just want to kind of finish here with\
[2:41:09](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9669) saying obviously\
[2:41:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9670) we would like to invite you all to islam\
[2:41:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9672) uh if you're not aware of it please do\

[2:42:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9741) uh the pondering soul uh very quickly i\
[2:42:24](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9744) think\
[2:42:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9745) uh sure brother sharif wanted to say\
[2:42:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9747) something i'm not sure if he still does\
[2:42:29](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9749) go sharif oh no no it's cool i think\
[2:42:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9752) we will probably have to end it anyway\
[2:42:35](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9755) we've got the limelight\
[2:42:36](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9756)Laughter
[2:42:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9759) no i just wanted to just answer this\
[2:42:40](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9760) particular issue about\
[2:42:42](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9762) people claiming that we're limiting god\
[2:42:44](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9764) when we say god can only do\
[2:42:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9766) logically possible things or that there\
[2:42:49](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9769) are certain questions which are\
[2:42:51](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9771) you know make a video make a video\
[2:42:55](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9775) yeah make a video an independent one and\
[2:42:57](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9777) we'll upload it to the channel\
[2:42:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9778) and then that way you don't have to feel\
[2:43:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9780) like you've got to rush through it\
[2:43:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9780) because it's a\
[2:43:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9782) uh a subject i think really needs to\
[2:43:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9784) know\
[2:43:05](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9785) i was just going to say look you know\
[2:43:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9786) somebody turning around and saying you\
[2:43:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9787) can't limit god well okay fine\
[2:43:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9790) can an unlimited god become limited\
[2:43:13](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9793) you know if you're going to start saying\
[2:43:15](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9795) well you know what everything's\
[2:43:17](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9797) possible with god then you're going to\
[2:43:19](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9799) fall into a contradiction and that's the\
[2:43:21](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9801) point i think goes back to what we\
[2:43:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9802) originally said\
[2:43:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9803) is that these sentences become\
[2:43:25](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9805) meaningless statements now\
[2:43:27](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9807) like talking about squared circles or\
[2:43:30](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9810) creating something impossible for god to\
[2:43:32](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9812) lift that type of thing because\
[2:43:34](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9814) if jesus is limited in his being then\
[2:43:37](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9817) you're saying at the same time funnily\
[2:43:39](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9819) enough you can't limit god\
[2:43:41](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9821) except when you limit him and it's like\
[2:43:43](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9823) yeah we're not saying anything i was\
[2:43:45](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9825) just going to say that and i was just\
[2:43:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9826) saying that\
[2:43:46](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9826) you know you know jesus for everybody uh\
[2:43:50](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9830) that have watched this uh and it was\
[2:43:52](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9832) interesting like i said the\
[2:43:53](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9833) the key thing that i think you get out\
[2:43:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9836) of\
[2:43:56](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9836) the discussion with christians is the\
[2:43:58](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9838) appeal to mystery\
[2:44:00](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9840) when they there's an issue about having\
[2:44:02](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9842) to try to reconcile\
[2:44:04](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9844) uh the logical problem or to try to\
[2:44:06](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9846) claim that\
[2:44:07](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9847) this is quote-unquote human logic that's\
[2:44:10](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9850) that is trying to understand comprehend\
[2:44:12](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9852) god we're not trying to comprehend god\
[2:44:14](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9854) what we're trying to do is comprehend\
[2:44:16](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9856) the idea whatever it is you're saying to\
[2:44:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9858) us\
[2:44:18](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9858) exactly yeah the proposition has been\
[2:44:20](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9860) pushed but i'll leave it there\
[2:44:22](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9862) because obviously i think we need to uh\
[2:44:23](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9863) end soon definitely so\
[2:44:26](https://youtu.be/smJ66-gtAYA?t=9866) again to everyone just one last repeat\
