## Description

Session 4  Part 2

In an age of information overload and widespread pseudo-intellectualism, understanding the core foundations of Islam is as essential as ever. 

This course comprehensively deconstructs the skeletal structure of prevalent ideologies and concepts such as atheism, scientism, materialism, secularism, and skepticism, in light of an all-encompassing intellectually robust Islamic worldview.

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krwadk8F6nU&t=0) - [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krwadk8F6nU&t=900)

 the presenter discusses the need for moral guidance, and how humans often rely on assumptions about life and morality to make decisions. He points to two examples of contradictory moral views - murder being a greater crime than rape, and bestiality being a lesser crime. argues that humans have always differed in their opinions on morality, and that this means that there is no one correct answer to questions of morality. Instead, people should look to Allah for guidance on how to live their lives.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krwadk8F6nU&t=0)**  the author explains the need for moral guidance, and how this need is created by our innate desire to worship God. He also explains that our wider moral judgments need to be guided by God, and that human beings have innate drives and needs other than just seeking to worship. He gives an example of how a moral judgment is made, and discusses how different situations can lead to different judgments. He concludes by discussing the ethics of different forms of intentional killing.

He goes on to say that this means that there is no one correct answer to questions of morality, and that people should instead look to Allah for guidance.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krwadk8F6nU&t=900)* Discusses the need for moral guidance in order to determine for ourselves how to live our lives and determine the right way to go about it. Allah has given us guidance in the Quran through verses such as the one mentioned in Hadid 25, which states that we sent prophets with clear proofs and revealed the scripture and the balance in order for humans to stand up for justice. This is why the revelation was meant to be a means of teaching humans how to be moral agents and to help them make decisions in their lives.

[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=14) i want you to imagine you had one  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=16) healthy individual he's got healthy  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=18) heart healthy lungs healthy liver  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=21) healthy kidneys he's a healthy  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=23) uh person  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=25) but then you had four unhealthy people  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=28) one who needs a heart one who needs a  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=31) lungs one who needs liver and one who  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=33) needs kidneys  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=34) and they need these things to live  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=37) in this scenario would it be ethical  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=40) would it be the moral thing to do to  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=42) kill that one healthy person  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=45) harvest their organs in order to save  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=47) for people  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=48) isn't this maximizing the greatest good  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=51) for the greatest number of people  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=53) is it a moral thing to do  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=57) so in first part in the first part of  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=59) this section of need for messengers we  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=61) spent some time talking about and  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=64) explaining the fitra of the human being  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=66) the fact that human beings have this  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=68) innate desire to worship which was  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=70) ultimately created by allah  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=73) however in this part  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=75) i want to expand our understanding of  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=77) the human nature  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=79) and explain that not only  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=82) would our instinct to worship require  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=84) regulating from allah from the creator  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=87) but also  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=88) our wider moral judgments we make needs  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=91) to be guided from by allah  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=94) you see human beings we've been created  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=96) with needs  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=98) and with drives  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=99) other drives other than just seeking to  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=101) worship so for example we have the drive  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=103) to eat to drink to sleep  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=106) we also have the drive within us to form  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=109) relationships with other people like  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=111) family bonds like living and interacting  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=114) with our neighbors like engaging in  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=116) trade like establishing security and  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=118) cooperation with other people  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=121) how then do we organize these types of  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=124) relationships this is part of us this is  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=126) what it means to be a human being to  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=128) live within a social society socially  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=131) with other people and interact so how  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=133) then do we regulate these types of  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=135) relationships  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=136) and not just that but also within human  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=140) beings we have this desire to do good  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=143) meaning we have this desire to seek the  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=146) moral or ethical value behind the  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=148) actions that we perform  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=150) so this innate desire to be moral as  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=152) well as being able you know this desire  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=154) to satisfy our instincts and biological  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=156) needs by interacting with others etc  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=160) we need to ask the question how do we do  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=162) this  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=163) while still being moral agents so how do  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=165) i go out and interact with my family or  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=168) with neighbors or how do i interact with  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=170) the ruler or how does a rule interact  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=171) with me while being moral agents while  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=174) being able to be considered moral  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=176) now some people would argue  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=178) that we innately know whether an act is  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=181) moral or immoral we just simply have to  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=183) observe the act  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=185) in and of itself  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=186) but we need to ask  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=188) is it really moral  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=190) how do we know that our innate desire or  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=193) innate feeling that says something is  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=195) right or wrong is really a moral  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=198) judgment because a moral judgment is an  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=200) intellectual process  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=202) so let me give you an example killing  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=205) a number of people would normally say  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=207) our killing is innately wrong you can't  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=210) kill  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=211) however when making a moral judgment we  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=214) don't just look at the act itself  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=216) but also the circumstances behind the  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=218) action and the motivation of the person  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=221) or people who've done the action  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=223) so if we just say killing is innately  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=226) wrong  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=227) does that mean  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=229) that if a person who  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=231) you know goes out and intentionally  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=234) kills another person  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=236) you know out of premeditative intention  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=239) would he be considered equivalent  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=241) morally equivalent to the one who you  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=244) know accidentally killed a person you  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=246) know maybe they were driving down the  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=248) street the tire burst and they drove  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=250) into a person  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=252) or what about the person who killed in  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=254) self-defense is he going to be morally  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=257) equivalent to the one who killed  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=259) premeditatively or even the one who  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=262) killed  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=262) as an accident  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=264) or what about the state  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=266) that adjudicates that a person should be  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=268) killed and  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=269) executed because he committed murder as  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=273) an example and this is based upon the  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=274) law of that particular country  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=276) or even if we argue that killing  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=278) intentionally intentionally is always  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=280) wrong does that make euthanasia always  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=284) wrong  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=285) was it wrong for the british to enter  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=287) the world war ii and its soldiers  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=290) intentionally killed nazi soldiers  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=293) and we haven't even started talking  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=294) about abortion yet so this is also  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=297) another form of intentional killing and  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=299) the question then becomes also uh more  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=301) than you know about whether it's live or  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=303) not  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=304) but the point i'm trying to say is that  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=306) if you look at the act in and of itself  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=309) you can't say that the act tells us  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=312) whether it's morally right or morally  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=314) wrong so when people turn around say oh  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=315) you can just tell from your heart or you  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=317) can just tell inside of you or you're  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=319) born with this innate feeling that  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=320) something is morally wrong we don't even  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=322) look at morality in that way we don't  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=324) even look at the action that way we look  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=325) at the circumstances we look at the  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=328) motivations of the individuals and then  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=330) we start to make certain judgments upon  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=336) that so it's not the actual moral act  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=339) that gives us the moral judgment but  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=341) it's something else and in fact it's  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=342) what we call the metaphysical principles  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=345) that we hold so these are the  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=347) assumptions that we have about life and  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=350) it's these assumptions and this outlook  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=351) and this moral viewpoint that we have  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=353) about life it actually comes before  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=356) we look at and sense the act  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=358) so we have these assumptions about what  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=360) life should be about what should be  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=362) morally good what should be morally evil  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=364) and then place that upon the axe that we  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=366) sense for example euthen euthanasia so  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=369) euthanasia what is that it's killing  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=371) somebody because maybe they're  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=372) terminally ill or maybe they're in  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=374) severe pain and they want to die  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=377) is his life  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=379) in term who's in terminal pain is it  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=381) worth saving  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=383) or not or is it morally right to allow  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=386) that person to kill himself or morally  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=388) right for a for him to ask a doctor kit  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=390) to kill him  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=392) now this presupposes certain assumptions  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=395) about morality one of those assumptions  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=397) is that this life is about maximizing or  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=400) the value of life is about maximizing  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=403) pleasure and benefit for the individual  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=406) individual and minimizing pain  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=409) so this is your purpose  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=410) and this then forms your moral outlook  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=413) so if a person is not maximizing his  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=415) pleasure  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=417) because he's in greater pain so his pain  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=419) supersedes his pleasure then really does  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=422) he  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=423) therefore you know see his life as being  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=425) worthwhile and therefore is it a right  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=428) is it morally correct in that situation  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=430) to minimize the pain to kill the  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=433) individual through euthanasia  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=435) euthanasia  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=437) this then results in us you know  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=439) constantly scratching our heads you know  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=440) as human beings trying to work out is it  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=442) morally good is it morally right  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=444) euthanasia right euthanasia wrong some  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=446) countries say it's allowed some  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=447) countries don't say it's allowed  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=449) but it shows us this contradictory  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=451) nature this problem that we have even if  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=454) we turn around and talk about this  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=456) maximizing benefit for the majority of  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=458) people and minimizing the pain uh  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=460) criteria  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=462) then you know we go got that scenario i  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=464) gave at the beginning about harvesting a  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=467) healthy person's body in order to save  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=469) for sick people well it follows from the  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=471) moral this follows from this moral  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=473) outlook of utilitarianism  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=475) but sure but it also clearly indicates  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=477) certain contradictions because people  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=479) don't live their life like that people  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=481) disagree with that in in in certain  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=483) cases anyway in most cases but there are  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=486) also loads of other examples that we can  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=489) give in order to highlight the  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=490) contradictions within human beings when  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=493) they make moral judgments and therefore  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=495) the inability for human beings to make  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=497) moral judgments for example bestiality  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=500) is a classic example you know is it  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=502) morally right or morally wrong now most  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=505) people probably say that's disgusting  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=506) that's morally wrong  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=508) but there are people who actually argue  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=510) it's a moral right and in fact you've  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=512) got the problem if you think you sh  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=515) that it's morally wrong  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=517) and in fact there is an argument that  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=518) one person proposed and he said and he  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=522) proposes not to articulate an argument  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=524) for bestiality but to show its  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=526) contradiction he said in most societies  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=529) murder is considered a greater crime  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=531) than rape  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=533) yeah so  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=534) if the question about bestiality is  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=536) wrong because you can't get consent of  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=539) the animal you know before  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=541) you know the  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=542) man or woman whatever starts doing some  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=544) dodgy things with the animal yeah  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=547) then  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=548) did you seek consent to kill the animal  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=551) and eat its meat  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=552) if you didn't believe it was morally  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=554) right or wrong to seek its consent to  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=557) kill it and eat it  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=558) and that's considered murder  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=560) then rape would be of a lesser degree  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=564) so by therefore the logic would follow  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=566) that bestiality being a lesser crime  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=569) would be allowed so he's trying to show  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=571) and trying to argue the point actually  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=573) this doesn't make a  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=575) you know this is the problem or the  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=576) contradiction of the the inconsistency  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=578) when human beings make these types of  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=580) decisions  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=581) but there are other people  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=583) like the moral philosopher peter singer  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=585) singer who actually argues that  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=588) bestiality should be made legal  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=591) he's actually says it should be made  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=592) legal  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=593) and that to be against bestiality is a  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=596) form of racism  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=598) known as speciesism yeah  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=601) so he's arguing that actually you know  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=604) why are you being prejudiced against the  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=605) cat and the dog yeah or the dolphin or  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=607) whatever is the orangutan you know if  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=610) love is love this is what his argument  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=613) is  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=614) similarly the same femoral philosopher  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=616) who's talking about racism towards  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=618) animals because you're not allowing  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=619) bestiality  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=620) also argued that it was morally right to  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=623) kill and  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=624) that kill an unborn child  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=626) and it was morally right to kill an  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=629) infant child as well so not only is it  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=631) right to kill an aborted you know a an  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=633) unborn child in the mother's womb but  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=636) also an infant child outside of the  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=637) mother's womb because he said look you  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=640) know he's trying to follow this logic  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=642) and show consistency and logic he said  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=645) if you can kill a child that's in the  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=647) mother's womb then what's the moral  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=649) difference between a child that's  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=651) outside of the mother's womb people say  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=653) well the child won't live without the  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=655) mother  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=657) being inside the womb  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=659) he said would the baby live  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=661) without the mother if the if the mother  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=663) didn't look after the baby  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=665) so they said no so therefore he said  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=667) well if you one is acceptable the other  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=669) one should be acceptable so if killing  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=671) the child inside the mother because it  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=673) can't live without the mother is  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=674) acceptable then killing the child  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=676) outside of the mother should also be  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=677) acceptable if the baby can't look after  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=679) itself without the mother  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=682) so here's his argument so therefore he  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=684) was trying to provide the moral  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=685) justification for infanticide then you  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=688) got our favorite atheist richard dawkins  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=691) who tweeted about whether a mother  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=693) should undertake an abortion if they  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=695) found out that their child had down  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=697) syndrome  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=698) he said when he was asked a question  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=700) from a from a woman about you know if i  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=702) was pregnant with a down syndrome maybe  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=704) i wouldn't know what to do this is what  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=706) he said he said i bought it and try  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=708) again  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=709) it would be immoral he's not even saying  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=712) you know he's giving him you know not  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=714) just saying it's acceptable he said it's  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=715) immoral to bring into the world  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=718) if you have a choice  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=720) so it's immoral to have a handicapped or  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=723) a down syndrome baby  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=725) in fact  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=726) these types of tweets and justifications  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=729) and moral perspectives you know echoes  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=732) back to the ideas of eugenics you know  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=734) killing off bad genes  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=736) from spreading within society or  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=738) stopping them to spread from the wider  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=739) society and this is where you had  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=741) eugenics programs within fascism and  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=743) nazi germany etc  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=745) but you know the thing is that we can  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=747) apply  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=748) this question on morality on a number of  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=750) examples or a number of actions and what  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=753) we all notice is humans have always  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=756) differed over this question i whether  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=758) morality is good or not  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=760) and this has always been the case so  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=762) even if we go further back and we talk  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=764) about democracy you know today people  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=766) say democracy is a moral form of  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=767) government  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=768) but in the past plato socrates and  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=770) aristotle argued against democracy  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=773) saying it's irrational it's immoral  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=777) similarly aristotle himself he argued  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=779) for the morality of slavery  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=781) and i could keep giving examples from  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=783) homosexuality being considered immoral  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=786) and unnatural act to now people  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=788) considering it moral to the differences  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=790) of age of consent where in the past it  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=792) used to be as low as seven or you know  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=794) even younger to now it has to be 16 or  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=797) 18 or in some countries higher you know  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=800) where in the past you know homosexuality  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=803) and you know transgenderism was  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=805) considered psychological illness to now  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=808) you you people celebrate when kids  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=811) little kids are transitioning from one  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=813) gender to another  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=815) so  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=816) and even those people who consider  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=817) incest to be abhorrent now we don't know  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=820) whether in the future people will turn  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=822) around and argue well if it's two  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=823) consenting adults you know  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=826) love is love isn't it  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=827) so when humans  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=829) want to make morals or seek moral  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=831) justifications for their actions  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=833) without the guidance from the creator  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=835) they end up contradicting themselves  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=837) changing their moral views over times  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=839) and places and thus morality without  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=842) this anchoring  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=843) to allah anchoring to the creator  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=846) makes morality subjective and have no  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=849) basis  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=850) so the only way to satisfy our need to  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=852) be moral  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=854) and uh is to have our actions guided  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=857) upon  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=859) allah's guidance  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=861) that's therefore we would seek out that  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=863) guidance not only are we seeking out the  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=866) guidance because allah created us with a  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=869) desire to worship but also we're seeking  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=871) guidance in order to know how to live  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=873) our life correctly and it's rational to  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=877) accept that if allah had created us each  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=881) individual created our needs our  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=883) instincts our desire to be good  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=886) then who knows better how a human being  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=889) should act and function than the one who  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=891) created that creation in the first place  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=894) so rather than leaving humanity to  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=896) wander in darkness and ignorance of  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=898) self-contradiction we look out for a  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=900) communication on all aspects of our life  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=903) in order to determine for us how to live  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=905) our life  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=906) allah he says in the quran in surah  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=910) hadid verse 25 indeed we sent our  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=913) messengers will with clear proofs and  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=916) revealed with them the scripture  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=918) and the balance  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=922) so that mankind may stand up for justice  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=925) the purpose of the revelation then and  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=927) the guidance was that human beings were  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=930) able to become moral agents  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/Krwadk8F6nU?t=942) you
