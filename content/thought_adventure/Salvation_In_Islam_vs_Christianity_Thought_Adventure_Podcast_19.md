## Summary of [Salvation In Islam vs Christianity | Thought Adventure Podcast #19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o)


*<span style="color:red; font-size:125%">This summary is AI generated - there may be inaccuracies</span>.

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=3600)

discusses the Islamic concept of salvation, as well as the possible fate of non-Muslims who attempt to enter paradise. It is explained that, while Christianity makes clear promises of salvation to those who accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior, Islam does not make this same sort of clear promise. Instead, Allah only knows the intentions of individuals and makes promises based on their apparent behavior and sincerity.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=0)**  Sharif discusses salvation in Islam and Christianity. He explains that salvation in Islam is attained through the correct belief and good actions, while salvation in Christianity is attained through faith in Jesus Christ and good works.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=300)** Sharif discusses the Islamic concept of salvation, which involves belief in Allah and doing good deeds in order to gain mercy from Allah. He explains that this does not mean that good actions on their own are sufficient, but that one must seek repentance (forgiveness) before Allah. Finally, Sharif gives his opinion on who is actually held responsible for their beliefs and actions.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=600)** Islam teaches that people are judged on their ability to know and understand the religion, as well as their ability to put those actions in motion. There is disagreement amongst Islamic scholars on the level of responsibility a person must meet in order to be considered eligible for salvation.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=900)** In this Thought Adventure podcast, the speaker discusses how Islam differs from Christianity in terms of their respective promises of salvation. He points out that, while Christianity makes clear promises of salvation to those who accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior, Islam does not make this same sort of clear promise. Instead, Allah only knows the intentions of individuals and makes promises based on their apparent behavior and sincerity. In the end, both religions maintain a self-awareness that allows for continual growth and change.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=1200)** In Islam, repentance is possible for those who have committed a major sin, even if they have committed the unforgivable sin of shirk. If a person does not repent, they may be liable to punishment in the afterlife.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=1500)** , Sharif discusses the Islamic concept of salvation, as well as the possible fate of non-Muslims who attempt to enter paradise. He specifies that, by definition, those who are considered to be "non-Muslim" will end up in hell, but that there is a way for those who are deemed to be "mushriks" or "kafirs" (those who do not believe in Islam) to be saved.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=1800)** , Sharif addresses the question of what happens to people who have never heard of Islam, but come across it on the day of judgement. Some scholars argue that they will be tested, and if they pass, they will enter heaven. If they don't, they will enter hellfire.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=2100)** In the Christian religion, salvation is obtained through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance of sins, and doing good deeds. Muslims also believe in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, but they also believe that good deeds and following the teachings of the prophet Muhammad help to gain salvation.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=2400)** According to Christians, death is the punishment for sin, and because of this, God needed a perfect sacrifice - in this case, Jesus Christ. Christ's death also fulfilled God's promise that sin would be punished by death.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=2700)** In this Thought Adventure Podcast, the presenter discusses different theories of Christ's death, including the Christus Victor model which emphasizes Christ's mercy and love. He mentions that different denominations hold to different models, but ultimately all of them agree that Christ died for our sins in a substitutionary way.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=3000)* Discusses the different ways that different Christians understand how one can be saved, with Catholicism emphasizing grace and works, and Protestantism emphasizing faith alone.  then goes on to say that if an individual does not believe in Jesus as their personal savior, they are "done" for in terms of salvation.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=3300)* Discusses the issue of whether or not it is rational for an innocent person to die for the sins of all of the guilty. The presenter argues that, from an intuitive perspective, it does not make sense for a person to be punished for a crime they did not commit. God judges people justly, and does not do this arbitrarily.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=7200)

 discusses the differences between salvation in Islam and Christianity. Muslims believe that everyone will be judged justly, and that there is always a chance for repentance. Christians believe that faith in God is the only way to be saved, and that animal sacrifices are not necessary for forgiveness. Both faiths place importance on the teachings of the Old Testament.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=3600)**  Muslim and Christian thought leaders discuss the difference between salvation in Islam and Christianity. Muslims believe that everyone will be judged justly, and that there is always a chance for repentance. Christians believe that faith in God is the only way to be saved, and that animal sacrifices are not necessary for forgiveness. Both faiths place importance on the teachings of the Old Testament.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=3900)**  the hosts discuss different aspects of salvation in Islam and Christianity. They mention that in Christianity, people are punished for their own sins, which means that people are not punished for the sins of others. Muslims also agree that human sacrifice is abhorrent to God, and that the sacrificial system in the Old Testament was for unintentional sins only. Finally, the hosts discuss how some New Testament authors seem to endorse a doctrine of substitutionary atonement, while Luke appears to omit aspects of this doctrine in his gospel.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=4200)** Brother Zack discusses the necessity of Christ's death in relation to human deliverance. He cites various theologians and scholars who disagree on whether it was necessary, and he responds to objections. He concludes that while it was possible, there may have been another way God could have done it.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=4500)** In Islam, shirk is the act of associating partners with God, which is considered to be unforgivable. In Christianity, repentance is seen as the key to forgiveness, and those who do not repent will suffer in hellfire.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=4800)* Discusses how Salvation within Christianity is not foolish, but rather based on scriptural evidence. He also mentions that there was a change in terms of how people understood salvation in the New Testament, which was not present in the Old Testament. Finally, the author asks Jake to respond to two of his points.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=5100)** , Abdul Rahman discusses the difference between salvation in Islam and Christianity. He points out that in Islam, all sinners are saved, regardless of their deeds. He then goes on to say that because Christianity believes in predestination, it is foolish for unbelievers to believe in it. However, Abdul Rahman argues that the gospel is reasonable and that all sins must be punished in order to have justice. Jake then asks Abdul Rahman about 1 Corinthians 1:23 which states that the gospel is foolishness to the Greeks. Abdul Rahman discusses how the gospel is foolishness to the Greeks because it is a stumbling block to them.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=5400)** , the presenter argues that the "sacrificial system" in the Old Testament where animals were killed did not actually remove sins, but paid for them when Christ died on the Cross.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=5700)** , a Christian and a Muslim discuss the difference between Christianity and Islam regarding the concept of sacrifice. The Christian argues that, in Christianity, God does not delight in sacrifices, which means that they are not necessary. The Muslim, on the other hand, argues that, in Islam, sacrifice is necessary because it is an expression of repentance. Christ, according to the Muslim, would not have come to suffer on the cross if it were not necessary for the salvation of humanity.
* **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=6000)** The original people who followed the Torah were saved by repentance, animal sacrifice, and following the law. If they had believed in Jesus, their salvation would have progressed further. Christ's sacrifice was essential for all humanity, and it is not necessary anymore to follow those practices in order to be saved.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=6300)**  the host challenges Christianity's position that it is rational to believe in salvation through obedience to the Mosaic law. The host also challenges Christianity's position that all sacrifices are necessary for salvation. Finally, the host provides an example of a Muslim who repents and is forgiven by God without any sacrifices.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=6600)**  a Muslim and a Christian discuss repentance. The Muslim says that repentance in Islam is feeling regret for what one has done, seeking to recompense the mistake, and being sincere. The Christian says that repentance is simply saying "I'm sorry."
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=6900)** The muslim perspective on justice is that it is based on mercy, not on punishment. They argue that the psalmist is saying that God does not care about sacrifices, and that a contrite heart is what God wants. They also point to Isaiah 53, where it is prophesied that Christ will suffer for our sins.
### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=7200) - [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=10800)

 discusses the concept of atonement in Christianity and Islam. The theory of atonement that Jake takes is that it is moral governance view centered around the kingship of Christ. The purpose of the sacrifice done at Calvary was to show God's hatred of sin and to provide a just punishment for Jesus Christ. Christ is worthy of taking on this punishment because he takes on the office of king of all of humanity and the  of the church.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=7200)**  Jake responds to Christian claims that God cannot forgive sin without sacrifice. He cites Isaiah 53, which predicts that the Messiah will be punished but still be merciful.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=7500)** , Jake discusses the concept of atonement in Christianity and Islam. The theory of atonement that Jake takes is that it is moral governance view centered around the kingship of Christ. The purpose of the sacrifice done at Calvary was to show God's hatred of sin and to provide a just punishment for Jesus Christ. Christ is worthy of taking on this punishment because he takes on the office of king of all of humanity and the  of the church. By doing so, he removes the sin of everyone who has bound themselves onto Christ by their baptism and through participating in the sacraments themselves.
* **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=7800)**  the members of Thought Adventure discuss the idea of a king taking on a punishment on behalf of his people. The Islamic texts state that a king can do this, and the Christian texts state that God can ask this of Abraham. Abdul argues that because ismail is not being punished for anything, the analogy cannot lead to the justification of the punishment of an innocent king. Jake argues that the analogy does lead to the justification of the punishment of an innocent king, as it shows that God can take the life of a person for the sake of justice.
* **[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=8100)** Salvation in Islam and Christianity differ on the idea of substitutionary atonement. Islam holds that Christ dies for the entire nation, while Christianity believes that Christ dies for an individual or institution. Baptism, confirmation, and the sacraments of Christianity bind an individual to Christ's life, death, and resurrection. Kings can take the place of their people in Islam because they are their leader and accept the responsibility of punishments and sins.
* **[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=8400)** In Islam, death is not seen as a punishment for sin. In Christianity, death is seen as a punishment for sin, or as a punishment for the guilty person.
* **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=8700)** Muslims believe that death is a punishment for sin. Christians believe that death is a punishment for sin, but also an opportunity for salvation.
* **[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=9000)** Governmental theory is a theory of atonement that does not include substitutionary atonement. John discusses this theory with Thought Adventure podcast host, John. The two discuss whether or not governmental theory can incorporate substitutionary atonement.
* **[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=9300)** Two main theories of atonement are the satisfaction theory and the penal substitutionary theory. The governmental view is similar to the satisfaction theory, but differs in that it does not affirm that Christ endured the precise punishment that sin deserves. The main difference between the two theories is that the penal substitutionary theory emphasizes Christ's role as both God and man, and as sinless, which makes it different from the satisfaction theory.
* **[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=9600)** Theist David argues that death is bad, but says it's not as bad on the Islamic paradigm because death is a creation. He also points out that martyrdom is a way of testifying to the truth of a religion and is not bad in and of itself.
* **[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=9900)** , John Fisher explains the difference between Jesus Christ's role as the  of the church and the more general role of moral governor of the universe. He also touches on the idea of two separate offices for God, one as moral governor and another as  of the church. He argues that this is not analogous to God paying himself back with his own life, as this would be two different offices with two different responsibilities.
* **[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=10200)* Discusses how salvation in Islam differs from Christianity, and how one event (the flood) can be applied to different groups of people in different ways. John argues that under Christianity, Isaac was innocent, but under Islam, Ishmael is still considered innocent.
* **[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=10500)** , an atheist argues that the idea of substitutionary atonement - where an innocent person pays for the sins of a guilty person - does not make sense from a human perspective. The atheist argues that the idea is more obvious to most humans that death is a transition from one life to the next.
### [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=10800) - [03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=13500)

, Jake Hecht and Sharif Zakaria discuss the differences between Islam and Christianity in terms of salvation and the purpose of life. Zakaria argues that the purpose of life in Islam is to eliminate one's sins and raise one's rank in front of Allah, while Christianity teaches that the purpose of life is to find meaning in life. Hecht adds that in Christianity, purpose is not just about seeking happiness and pain, but also about finding meaning in life.

**[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=10800)** In the thought adventure podcast, Jake and John discuss the idea that death may not be a punishment in Islam and Christianity. Jake points out that one intuition may be more far-fetched than the other, and John agrees. John then asks Jake to explain what he is saying, and Jake responds that if both Muslims and Christians find something counterintuitive, they should move on.
* **[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=11100)**  Jake discusses the idea of substitution with Prophet Jonah. He points out that this idea is illogical, as it would punish an innocent person for no reason. He also discusses the idea of repentance and forgiveness in the context of the city of Nineveh.
* **[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=11400)** The Christian waiting for the Muslims to finish their discussion asks Richard to give his opinion on the topic of original sin. Richard argues that in Christian terms, the father is the one who does the job of Jesus, who was not doing the job of God.
* **[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=11700)** , a Christian argues that because of the Bible's claim that the father perfectly adhered to all of Yahweh's requests and demands, they are therefore claiming to be Yahweh. They go on to argue that because Jesus was an innocent man, he was able to take up all the burden of sin and be the perfect sin sacrifice, meaning that anything that god says goes against logic. They maintain that because god made up the rules, he is not bound by them and can arbitrarily change them, leading to the belief that he created us to commit sin and that he is not just.
* **[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=12000)** , the author discusses how Christianity and Islam differ in their views of salvation. Christianity believes that salvation is only available to those who are already saved, while Islam believes that everyone needs salvation, regardless of their status in life. According to the author, this difference is a matter of pride, as Christians falsely believe that they are inherently more deserving of salvation than those who do not believe in Christianity.
* **[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=12300)** Abdul Rahman asks Christians why they believe that the guilty person who knowingly commits sin should not bear the consequence of that sin. Christians reply that they have read the Bible within a specific lens and that this narrow perspective limits their understanding of the text.
* **[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=12600)* Discusses how Muslims view hell and how they prepare themselves for it. He also discusses how Muslims hope for salvation while still fearing it.
* **[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=12900)* Discusses the difference between Christianity and Islam, and how both faiths believe in seeking happiness. Islam teaches that happiness is not the ultimate goal, and that pain can sometimes be a part of life's journey in search of a higher purpose.
* **[03:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=13200)** explains that, just like with any other person, Muslims and Christians face difficulties and hardships in life, but that finding purpose and meaning in life can help navigate these challenges. He suggests that, if someone lacks meaning and purpose in life, they may become depressed.
* **[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xh3ZqT8-o&t=13500)** , Sharif Zakaria and Jake Hecht discuss the differences between Islam and Christianity and how each religion views the purpose of life. Zakaria points out that the purpose in Islam is to eliminate one's sins and raise one's rank in front of Allah, while Christianity teaches that the purpose of life is to find meaning in life. Hecht adds that in Christianity, purpose is not just about seeking happiness and pain, but also about finding meaning in life. Finally, they announce that their next live stream will be with Alex Malpass.

[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=195) so  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=196) um  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=197) yeah abdul was probably going to be a  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=199) few minutes so we might as well just  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=200) jump straight into it yeah right so  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=204) the topic is salvation in islam  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=207) uh in christianity what we're going to  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=208) do first  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=210) is we're going to go through the islamic  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=212) perspective  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=214) on what salvation is  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=216) um some details about it and then we're  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=218) going to go through  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=220) the side in christianity and then  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=222) eventually as you guys know how we do it  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=224) on tap probably about after what maybe  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=227) 45 minutes to an hour uh we'll open it  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=230) up to guests and you guys can come on  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=232) ask questions or  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=234) make comments so everybody's saying yeah  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=237) i'm back yes i am back in the flash i'm  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=240) here  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=241) so uh it's good to see you guys here  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=244) but um so yeah the first question  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=247) that i have for you sharif is  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=250) i guess we might as well start off by  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=252) saying  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=253) what is salvation and generally how is  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=256) it attained in islam  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=260) okay yeah i'm the last so i think uh  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=265) i don't obviously there's different  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=267) angles uh but just to give a very brief  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=269) overview in terms of what uh and then  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=272) we'll go on the specifics yeah  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=274) so so i think it's not that complicated  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=276) regards to salvation within islam  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=279) ultimately allah  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=282) expects two things for us in order to  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=284) achieve the grace and mercy from allah  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=287) and that is  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=288) the right belief  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=290) and good actions  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=292) and those are the two things that if a  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=294) person has the correct belief he does  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=297) the performance of the good actions  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=299) uh  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=300) that he achieves salvation and  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=303) you know maybe some alarm bells might be  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=306) ringing from some of our  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=308) christian colleagues and friends which  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=310) is that they think oh good actions it's  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=313) all about the works it's not a you know  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=315) how are you going to get equal  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=316) how are you going to get right with god  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=319) yeah it's impossible for you to do that  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=321) with your actions but no that's not the  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=323) case within islam  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=324) because within islam we recognize that  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=327) our good actions are not sufficient in  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=330) order to achieve  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=332) uh  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=333) salvation on its own and we've got the  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=335) very famous hadith of the prophet  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=336) sallallahu alaihi wasallam who explains  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=339) that there was a man who had done uh you  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=342) know had done worship and done righteous  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=345) actions for  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=346) you know many many years  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=349) and you know when he was and he's  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=351) narrated when he's brought forward  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=352) before  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=353) allah will ask him do you want to enter  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=356) paradise you want to achieve salvation  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=358) do you want to achieve you know allah's  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=360) pleasure through your good actions or  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=362) through the mercy through the grace of  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=364) allah yeah the mercy of allah  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=368) and you know he thought that he's done  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=370) all the good actions that would be  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=372) sufficient and so  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=374) he then said okay through my good  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=375) actions and then allah weighs  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=378) all the good actions that he's done  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=381) with the  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=382) the uh the mercy and the buttock and the  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=385) blessings of just his eyesight yeah i  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=387) think in some narrations he says one of  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=389) his eyes  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=390) and that one you know blessings from  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=393) that one aspect that allah has given to  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=395) human beings i'll wait all of his good  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=397) actions and then the man realizes that  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=400) by your mercy yeah so we're taught by  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=403) the prophet sallallahu alaikum that good  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=406) actions on their own are not sufficient  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=408) so what do we mean by belief well belief  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=410) obviously is the correct belief the the  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=414) very on the basis of the islamic which  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=417) is the six pillars of the islamic faith  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=420) or iman you know belief in allah the  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=422) angels the books the prophets the day of  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=425) judgment and al-qaeda the good and the  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=427) bad of which is from allah these are the  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=430) fundamental pillars of islam and when it  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=432) comes to the good actions it's the  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=434) sharia  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=435) abiding by what allah has ordained for  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=438) us was established within the quran  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=440) within the sunni of the prophet  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=441) sallallahu alaihi wasallam  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=443) and that means you know in terms of our  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=446) relationship with allah how how we  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=448) worship our eberdah  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=450) how we relate to other people  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=453) and how we uh relate to ourselves  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=455) through our  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=456) yeah our morality in good manners so you  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=459) know ibadah means worship is that direct  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=462) relationship with allah that we have  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=465) uh  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=466) means how we interact with other people  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=469) and then obviously how we how we clothe  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=471) ourselves the morals the manners that we  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=473) have is what we mean by  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=476) these all of these things follow within  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=478) the sharia within  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=479) um righteous actions and then obviously  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=483) it's a case of staying away from evil  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=485) staying away from sin and if we commit  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=487) sin to constantly seek repentance before  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=490) allah  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=492) and  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=493) you know maybe we can talk about what  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=495) what it means when it goes to repentance  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=497) within the islamic paradigm but then we  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=499) seek repentance before allah and hope  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=503) for allah's forgiveness and mercy and  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=505) overlooking our bad deeds so that's just  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=507) i think that's quite clear i think it's  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=510) not that complicated  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=512) i think if we do have the right beliefs  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=515) we perform the good actions then we are  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=518) uh  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=519) then we have the the ability to gain the  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=521) mercy of allah yeah so i think that's  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=524) that's the issue  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=526) right yeah because  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=527) for people who don't know  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=529) salvation basically is when we're  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=532) talking about how how do you get  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=533) salvation we're talking about how does  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=535) one  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=536) make it to paradise or heaven how are  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=539) you in right standing with god and saved  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=542) from um you know damnation and hell and  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=545) things like that so just want to be  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=547) clear on the terminology because some  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=548) people may not know what salvation even  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=551) really means so that's what we're  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=553) referring to and and sharif was  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=555) explaining all that  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=556) now  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=558) you know specifically is  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=561) what comes up  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=562) is some people may wonder well who's  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=565) actually accountable  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=567) uh for their beliefs and actions when  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=570) when it comes to these things um and so  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=572) from an islamic perspective  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=574) uh who is held accountable for their  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=577) beliefs and actions  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=579) what would you say to that sharif and  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=581) then i'll come and give my two cents  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=583) uh yeah so uh we say isn't it that the  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=586) the one in islam we say the mukallif is  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=589) the one who's well held responsible  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=592) so much is the one literally means the  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=594) one who's responsible and so we say  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=597) there are basically three people who are  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=599) not held responsible  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=601) the first is a child so until they reach  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=604) the age of maturity yeah the second is  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=608) the one who's insane or has doesn't have  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=610) rational capacity  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=612) you know until he either he regains  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=614) conscience regains his sanity  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=616) and the third one is the one who either  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=619) you know basically he forgets or he over  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=621) sleeps basically is a period of  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=623) non-conscious awareness of what he's  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=625) doing until he remembers or until he  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=628) gains consciousness so anybody of those  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=630) three categories are basically  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=633) not responsible before the sharia yeah  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=636) so anybody who  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=638) is other than those three people  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=641) will in generality as human beings would  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=644) be considered responsible now some  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=646) people will talk about okay what about  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=649) the one who is unaware of islam never  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=652) come across islam  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=655) what's his  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=657) salvation what's his responsibility  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=659) and in origin there is differences of  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=662) opinion amongst the scholars so there's  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=664) verses of quran in which allah says that  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=666) he does not punish a people until he  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=668) sent a messenger to that to that town so  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=672) the idea is that you have to have  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=673) received the message so some scholars  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=676) say well that means that person has to  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=679) receive the message before they're held  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=681) accountable and then this question about  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=683) whether what's the level of  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=685) responsibility that's required yeah  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=688) what's the uh  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=690) uh it's like another level what's the  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=692) level of the message that he needs to  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=694) receive yeah uh you know does it have to  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=696) be just hearing that islam is true does  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=699) it have to be more than that does it  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=700) have to be like being clearly convinced  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=703) you know given the clear evidences and  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=705) proofs of islam you know so there is  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=708) over the level but ultimately we believe  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=711) that all human beings who have a  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=712) rational sound capacity who reached age  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=715) of maturity  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=716) are under  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=718) a certain level of responsibility to  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=721) seek out guidance  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=722) yeah  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=723) whether they achieve or not that's a  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=726) separate issue in terms of whether they  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=727) become muslim but if they're in earnest  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=729) they're sincere uh but they've just not  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=732) heard the message of islam or it's been  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=734) tainted for them or it's not clear in  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=736) terms of the evidences then we believe  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=738) allah dies merciful but obviously in  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=740) that situation there is  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=742) various scholarly differences of opinion  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=744) on that it's a bit of an academic point  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=746) of view uh in in generality  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=749) right right  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=750) yeah  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=751) and the way i understand it is  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=754) basically what you're saying that uh  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=757) people are going to be judged on their  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=759) capability what they had the ability to  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=762) know  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=763) and learn and be able to implement  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=766) actions uh behind it as well because  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=768) obviously if you're  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=769) um well let me not even go into that but  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=772) so it's going to be based on your  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=774) capability what you're able to as far as  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=777) rationally and physically be able to  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=779) know and understand and also put those  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=782) actions in um  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=784) you know put those deeds you know  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=786) forward  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=787) but at the same time  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=790) uh what you were mentioning about uh  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=793) receiving the message that's very  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=795) important too because if they didn't  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=796) receive the message at all  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=798) then  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=799) what are they going to be held  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=801) accountable for well some people think  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=803) well at the very least they can know  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=805) that there's a creator uh that created  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=808) everything  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=809) and um and then maybe even some  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=813) moral principles but that's a little bit  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=815) especially in islamic tradition that's a  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=817) little bit more  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=818) contested  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=820) um but imam ghazali actually even talks  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=823) about that if somebody hears about islam  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=826) but is such a distorted  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=828) version of it and it's not even really  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=830) accurate then they're not actually  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=832) rejecting islam they're rejecting  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=834) a caricature of it and see so it's very  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=837) important um from a muslim paradigm  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=840) that you're first you have the ability  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=843) to be able to know and implement action  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=846) and also  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=847) that uh you received the message and to  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=850) what capacity was it tainted in any way  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=852) so there's it's all sorts of  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=855) distinctions that we can raise and it's  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=856) very difficult you know because a lot of  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=859) times christians want sort of a neat  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=861) answer to these things and not just them  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=863) shouldn't say just them but people in  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=865) general and they want to be asked about  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=867) specific people oh what about this  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=870) person or about this person when islam  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=872) we don't make  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=875) declarations of certainty about the  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=878) afterlife  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=879) about individual people we can talk  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=882) about beliefs and actions and if you do  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=885) those type of things where it sort of  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=887) leads to but we don't make proclamations  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=890) on individuals other than the ones that  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=893) are specifically mentioned in the quran  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=896) and the sunnah for example we have the  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=898) hadith of the prophet  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=901) where he mentions certain people that  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=903) he's guaranteeing paradise for for  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=905) example or in in the quran certain  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=908) people like the pharaoh is mentioned as  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=911) he's going to be in hell  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=913) so  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=914) other than these small number of  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=917) exceptions we do not make proclamations  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=920) about individuals and that's very  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=921) important  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=923) because a lot of times  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=925) people um  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=927) sometimes out of ignorance or maybe even  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=930) frustration they go a bit too far and  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=932) make these kind of statements that we as  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=935) muslims we're just we're not allowed to  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=936) say those kind of things so interesting  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=939) because what's interesting here because  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=941) i know what the uh general contention or  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=943) one not general but one of the key  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=945) consensus oh so you don't have a promise  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=948) that you're going to go to you're going  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=950) to achieve salvation we do yeah so so  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=953) there'll be christians out there saying  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=954) well we have yeah  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=956) uh we've got this promise all we have to  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=959) do is accept jesus died for us and  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=961) that's it we're transformed we've  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=963) received grace  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=965) but what i find interesting is okay well  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=968) what about that christian who at that  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=970) moment accepts it and then maybe a few  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=972) years later  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=973) he becomes an apostate he leaves  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=975) christianity  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=977) what would the christians say then well  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=978) christian would say well he never really  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=980) achieved grace so they're really  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=982) actually in the same position how do  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=984) they know that they're going to die upon  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=986) their christianity  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=987) yeah because how do they know that they  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=990) are the elect for you yeah i don't know  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=993) if you want to see yeah they they yeah  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=994) they don't know in reality it's it's the  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=996) same result they don't know what their  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=998) end state is gonna be  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1000) and it's the same thing in the quran is  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1003) that  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1003) not only about the people  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1006) um of hell but the same of paradise we  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1009) don't say oh yeah that guy he's  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1011) definitely going to paradise  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1013) we you know we ask a law that that  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1015) happens especially after after the  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1017) person is dead  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1019) but  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1020) the people of paradise their beliefs and  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1023) their actions are described in the quran  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1026) and the same is true for the people of  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1027) hell so we can see the overall but we  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1031) don't  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1032) and another important thing to keep in  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1034) mind as well is the intention in islam  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1036) intention is very important  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1038) and allah  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1040) only allah knows the intentions of  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1042) people we don't know what's in the  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1043) hearts and minds of individuals we we're  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1046) to judge by the apparent  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1048) but we don't know what's in the hearts  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1050) and minds of people so we don't really  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1051) make those individual proclamations but  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1054) we do have promises in the quran we have  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1057) promises in the quran that if you do x y  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1060) and z and if you believe x y and z then  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1062) you will be in paradise right because he  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1065) he does make those promises  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1067) um  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1068) quite clearly and likewise the same same  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1071) goes for hell you if you you believe  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1073) this you you don't believe this uh you  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1077) do this and you don't do that  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1079) yeah that type of person  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1082) all things being equal they're they're  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1084) gonna go to hell but we don't know  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1086) because there's so many different  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1087) variables at play in the person's life  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1090) and their intentions that we just can't  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1092) say about individual people you see  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1095) so anyway you wanted to come in and say  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1097) no no i was going to say yeah no so it's  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1098) like like for example even in surah 13  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1101) yeah i can't remember which chapter  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1103) number of the  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1104) of the quran but it mentions isn't it it  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1107) says mentions that you know humans will  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1109) be a base to lose of law as philosophy  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1112) and then he says  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1118) you know except those who believe and do  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1119) righteous actions and for them there is  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1122) an unending reward an unfailing reward  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1124) so there's a clear promise yes  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1127) well what you're basically saying jake  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1128) is this is that well okay you've got  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1130) this very clear promise just like maybe  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1134) somebody from another faith like  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1135) christianity has this so-called  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1137) obviously we don't believe it but their  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1138) clear promise that if you accept uh  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1141) jesus died for your sins then they'll  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1143) say you do you're going to be  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1146) accepted but just like us we don't know  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1150) we don't have a magic wand in terms of  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1153) knowing what's going to happen to us in  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1154) the future or what's going to happen to  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1156) another person in the future so it keeps  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1159) us in essence from an islamic paradigm  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1160) it keeps us very grounded yeah very  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1164) self-aware  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1166) even you know aware of the actions that  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1168) we perform so there's a there's a famous  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1170) quote from imam shafi who said all  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1173) hearts are dead yeah except those with  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1176) knowledge and all those with knowledge  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1179) are asleep except those who perform  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1181) actions and all those who perform  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1183) actions are deceived except those with  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1185) sincerity and all those with sincerity  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1188) in a constant state of anxiety what he  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1190) means by that he's they're constantly  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1192) addressing why they perform the action  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1195) the sincerity behind the action you know  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1198) the the desire to want it to be accepted  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1200) before allah because they're thinking  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1203) you know have i done it with the right  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1205) intention you know constantly looking at  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1207) the bad actions that they do and that  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1209) they're trying to repent from that so it  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1211) creates this very grounded very  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1214) uh you know humility  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1216) yeah  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1218) this person with humility that actually  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1220) thinks to himself actually you know what  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1222) i have to really  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1223) concentrate upon what i'm doing and why  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1226) i'm doing like like when we do these  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1227) streams isn't it we we have to  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1229) constantly remind ourselves that okay  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1231) why are we doing are we doing it for  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1232) fame are we doing it for fortune  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1235) obviously not fortune but you know or  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1238) even fame but but obviously you know we  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1240) have to remind ourselves because the the  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1242) ego the enough the whispers of straight  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1245) on you know these things can start to  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1247) move us away and we think we're doing  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1249) something good but actually we're doing  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1252) it for our own selves  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1253) right yeah that's right um i think we  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1255) have uh abdirahman here yeah  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1259) salaam  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1259) thanks salaam  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1266) yeah so we're just talking about uh the  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1268) topic here salvation in islam versus  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1271) christianity  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1272) and uh we're going through the islamic  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1275) conception  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1277) so we talked about salvation generally  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1279) we talked about who's accountable for  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1280) their beliefs and who's not talked about  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1283) promises of people  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1286) so now we're at the point in the  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1288) questions i have here  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1290) what happens to muslims that commit  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1293) heinous sins  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1294) um because this may be a question  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1296) because in christianity you know uh at  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1299) least certain versions of it make it  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1301) seem like well you just got to believe  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1302) in jesus and that's the end of the story  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1304) i know that's a caricature of it but and  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1306) we'll get into that in a little bit  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1309) but some people may be wondering well  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1311) what about muslims that you know do bad  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1314) things that they commit heinous sins

[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1365) um  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1366) mine looks okay i don't know  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1370) am i coming in clearly for you sharif or  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1373) yeah yeah find him  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1374) okay anyway we want to just  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1376) go on yeah can you because i don't i'm  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1378) not seeing anything  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1380) in the chat that people are complaining  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1383) so yeah so yeah so really muslims that  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1385) commit these bad sins  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1387) okay so  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1388) uh  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1390) so the person who commits a sin he has  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1392) the opportunity  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1394) uh well it's a major sin and the  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1395) opportunity to repent yeah even the one  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1399) who commits shirk yeah so the one who  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1401) commits what we call the unforgivable  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1404) unfavorable sin and i'll explain how it  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1406) fits in within the context of what i'm  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1408) saying because we believe that if a  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1411) person turns in repentance before  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1413) allah's panel died before he dies and he  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1416) will be forgiven in terms of the fact  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1417) that he's actually uh you know very  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1419) sincere in the fact that if he was to  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1422) replay the situation again he wouldn't  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1425) commit the same error and same mistake  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1427) now if a person  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1429) doesn't repent or you know  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1431) his sins outweigh his good deeds or you  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1434) know  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1435) he was doing for the wrong intentions  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1438) uh things like that then the person is  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1440) liable to punishment yeah and you'll be  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1443) able to share they're saying it's you  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1444) who's lagging  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1447) yeah  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1449) i don't i'm i see abdul clear as day  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1452) yeah  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1453) sharif yeah yeah sharif you are lagging  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1455) i think for everybody so maybe  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1457) maybe  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1458) turning i can hear you but it's like  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1461) lagging it's breaking in and out maybe  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1463) okay let me try turning your video off  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1466) yeah  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1467) let me come back one second i'll come  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1469) back  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1472) um abdul i don't know if you heard the  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1475) question if you want to weigh in at all  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1476) yeah something about heinous sins and  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1478) what really happens to to muslims and  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1480) yeah muslims that basically commit sins  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1482) and and sharif was going into  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1484) um  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1486) let me see sharif was talking about um  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1489) repentance and he said that even for  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1492) shirk which is the unforgivable sin  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1494) people can repent for that up until they  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1497) die  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1497) so um yeah i mean i mean really it's  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1500) it's a question of um um of of  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1504) what does count as as uh you know  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1508) retribution or or or as as you know  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1512) making up for a sin whether you know  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1513) what's going to be punishment  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1515) or whether it's going to be a  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1518) repentance i mean there are a lot of  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1520) philosophical underpinnings there i  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1522) don't know if you guys touched upon it  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1523) but  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1524) like  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1526) i think from an islamic perspective it's  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1527) either like sincere repentance right uh  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1531) doing good that wipes away the bad  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1534) right um the the sincerity is just a  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1537) crucial factor and changing your ways is  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1540) so so so i mean that's kind of par part  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1543) of what it means to sincerely repent  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1546) uh it should be sufficient i mean some  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1548) muslims they may uh have sins that  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1551) aren't forgiven maybe they  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1553) their repentance hasn't been accepted  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1554) they weren't sincere whatever well  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1556) there can be punishment for that so um i  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1559) think it's pretty straightforward the  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1560) way the way i'm seeing it  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1563) yep and sharif's not here so uh yeah i  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1567) think it's  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1568) pretty stroke for straightforward though  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1571) one thing i do want to add which may be  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1574) slightly different than christianity  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1577) is that in islam  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1578) for some people for some  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1581) muslims that is  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1583) they may have to go to hell temporarily  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1587) um and i don't want to say it's the same  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1588) thing as purgatory but they may go to  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1590) hell temporarily where they have to pay  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1593) for their sins  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1594) and they will eventually be taken out  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1597) and be brought to paradise so that also  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1599) is  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1600) a possibility that i want to uh just  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1603) introduce and for people to keep in mind  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1605) um that's what i meant by the punishment  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1607) part so it might be the case that a  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1609) muslim dies and it's like still has sin  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1611) and stuff like that and maybe his  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1613) repentance hasn't been accepted he  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1615) hasn't repented or whatever it is i mean  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1617) they're there it's possible for a muslim  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1619) to be  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1619) accountable and punishable for their  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1621) sins  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1622) yeah  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1623) yeah and then actually sharif hinted at  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1625) this earlier  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1626) which uh  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1628) when he was just talking in broad  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1630) strokes about salvation but uh  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1633) the question is do muslims achieve  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1635) paradise without allah's mercy  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1638) because this is a common critique  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1641) of um  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1644) christians or skeptics usually  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1645) christians let's just be quite honest  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1648) where they say oh well your deeds are  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1650) what's meriting everything and you just  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1652) go it's all about you and you just yeah  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1654) so um yeah the question is do do muslims  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1657) achieve paradise without allah's mercy  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1660) so if you want to comment on that  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1663) no i mean of course not we don't we  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1664) don't we don't think anybody achieves  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1666) paradise without allah's mercy  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1668) and and the idea that we are accountable  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1670) for our sins  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1672) is not uh like does not negate the fact  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1675) that  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1676) if we were to  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1678) make it to to heaven and attain  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1679) salvation that would only be by allah's  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1682) mercy so the fact that your allah looks  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1685) at your deeds and and that the fact that  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1689) you are accountable for your acts does  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1691) not negate the the other uh  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1694) you know side of it which is very  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1695) important the allah's mercy and allah  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1697) accepting you into his mercy  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1700) right  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1701) um  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1702) so one second here okay sharif's still  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1705) not here uh  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1707) he's here he's here

[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1719) i moved to a new room  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1726) yeah  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1727) so um  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1728) yeah  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1729) i don't know if you wanted to tag  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1731) anything on but uh abdul kind of just  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1733) picked it up where you left off  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1735) okay i don't know where abdul told  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1739) yeah we might as well just move on right  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1741) because and we're already a half hour in  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1742) so and we got so we still got the  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1744) christianity stuff to go so then the  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1746) last question on islam and people can  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1749) ask their questions later when you guys  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1751) come on we'll put the link out in maybe  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1753) another 15-20 minutes and um and then  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1756) you guys will come on shortly after that  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1759) but uh last question is can non-muslims  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1763) go to paradise so what do you guys think  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1765) about that  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1767) no  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1769) sure yeah  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1771) so so so that i need to qualify that  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1774) i mean so  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1775) so by now so so what we mean by  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1778) non-muslims would basically be a um  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1782) and and and uh what what  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1784) what what's important here is that you  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1786) if you are a mushrik or you are a cafe  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1789) you will end up in hell that's the  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1792) islamic position however in order to  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1794) determine who truly is the mushrik and  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1796) who  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1797) truly is the kafir  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1799) aside from the legislative  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1801) factors that we do know in this dunya  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1803) the ultimate judgment is for allah and  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1805) he knows you know he he he judges by all  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1807) the factors that influence a a a  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1810) person's like you know belief formation  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1812) and stances on these things  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1815) and so many things play a role in that  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1817) so we're not in a place to judge  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1819) individuals but generally speaking  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1822) you know all things being equal  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1824) a outright state of uh rejecting and  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1828) denying the one who is the cause of your  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1831) very existence  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1833) makes you worthy of hell  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1836) yeah so i'm just going to add as well so  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1838) obviously the term non-muslim is a very  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1840) vague term from an islamic perspective  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1844) we use the word cather  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1846) and kafir  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1847) obviously linguistically comes from the  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1850) word  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1851) uh kafara or kuffer  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1853) which means to cover up and the idea is  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1856) that is to cover up or conceal the truth  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1858) that they know but they try to conceal  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1861) it in one way or another yeah they try  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1863) to lie uh even to themselves about it  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1867) so the question and i think we touched  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1869) upon this at the beginning uh of the  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1871) show with in terms of who is responsible  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1874) so the question is well what about the  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1875) average non-muslim who's never heard  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1878) islam or has heard very little about  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1880) islam or has heard a very destroyed  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1883) version of islam and on that perspective  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1885) there is  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1886) like i said at the beginning a different  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1888) scholarly difference of opinion about  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1890) what that person's status is now some  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1893) scholars they say that  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1895) people who have not heard about islam  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1897) and they come across  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1899) on the day of judgement that they will  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1901) be presented  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1902) by allah will present himself and tested  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1905) them on the day of judgment and if they  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1908) pass the test and they enter genna if  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1910) they don't pass the test  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1912) then they enter hellfire so there will  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1914) be a test for them  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1916) and that's what some scholars  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1917) they argue  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1922) right so  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1926) maybe maybe someone needs to touch also  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1928) on the idea of what muslim means so um  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1932) i mean yeah if you can you can or jake  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1934) you could touch upon that yeah  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1936) yeah i mean muslim in in terms of what  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1938) it just means linguistically someone who  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1941) submits himself to god  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1943) um obviously it has a certain  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1945) connotation being associated with the  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1947) religion of islam so to speak  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1950) but yeah technically  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1952) um  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1954) somebody  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1956) because the quran does mention in other  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1958) places and this is where it gets a  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1960) little tricky about the  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1962) there are certain people from people of  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1964) the book  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1965) um that are mentioned favorably  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1968) and so  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1970) could they be construed of as muslim in  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1973) a certain sense  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1974) in that they submit themselves to god  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1978) they do good they believe in god they  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1980) don't believe in trinity and all these  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1982) other false doctrines that we we go  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1985) through here  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1986) um  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1988) i mean that i guess that's kind of the  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1989) debated question right and as sharif  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1992) said certain people who didn't even hear  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1994) the message of islam at all  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1997) they will be presented with a test um  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=1999) it's not like they're just going to be  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2001) automatically going to heaven or  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2003) automatically going to hell it doesn't  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2005) work like that  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2006) so i don't know if you wanted to add  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2008) anything else on the term muslim abdul  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2011) well okay can i just uh really quickly i  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2014) was going to mention obviously in the  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2015) quran it mentions islam and muslim  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2018) both in a linguistic sense and also a  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2020) charity sense yeah shari basic means  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2024) legislative or has a divine meaning to  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2027) it yeah or a a technical meaning that  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2029) allah on the part  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2032) described to the particular meaning so  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2034) we mentioned about ibrahimovic a muslim  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2037) but it's used in a linguistic sense in  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2039) in the context of  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2040) linguistically as jake mentioned it  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2042) means the one who submits to the will of  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2044) god  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2045) so ibrahim alaihissalam islam jesus  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2048) abraham noah they're all muslim from the  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2051) islamic paradigm and the people who  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2053) followed them yeah  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2054) they're all considered muslim uh from a  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2057) linguistic point of view  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2058) but there's also a technical meaning of  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2060) the word muslim which is an islam which  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2062) is also mentioned within the quran and  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2065) the sunnah which basically means the one  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2067) who follows the message of the prophet  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2069) muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2071) he normally is used within the  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2074) definite article to differentiate uh  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2076) from the indefinite to the definite  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2078) article to differentiate whether it's  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2079) being used linguistically or in a  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2081) technical sense so so yeah so this is a  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2084) person who's a muslim so that's why on  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2087) the day of judgement the one who's not  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2089) heard islam some scholars say they'll be  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2091) tested to some hadith that talk about  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2093) this as well that they will be tested  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2096) and that if they pass that test meaning  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2098) that they submit to the will of god that  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2100) therefore they will be considered  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2102) quote-unquote a a muslim even though  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2105) they're not from a  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2107) the ones who understood or followed the  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2109) revelation of the prophet sallallahu  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2110) alaihi wasallam in that technical sense  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2114) right uh sharif  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2116) did you  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2117) see my message on whatsapp there i don't

[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2130) final thoughts because they're kind of  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2132) wrapping up the muslim  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2134) section and move over to christianity  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2137) yeah yeah i think it's fine i'm okay  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2139) cool so jake  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2142) as soon as you uh  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2145) our resident experts on christianity  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2147) let me ask you the question now  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2151) so uh what about christianity how so  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2153) from an exciting point of view  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2155) uh belief good actions allows you to  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2158) gain the mercy of god you seek  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2160) repentance of the sins that you do  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2163) and uh and as muslims with promise  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2165) therefore  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2167) we do these things we fulfill these  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2168) conditions we gain salvation from  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2171) christianity how does it work  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2173) yeah so  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2176) again this is a broad stroke and then  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2178) we're going to go into detail so i'm  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2180) going to ask answer it as general as i  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2182) can but  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2183) the common christian understanding is  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2186) look jesus christ who they also believe  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2189) was the messiah many of them also  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2191) believe that he's god most of them in  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2193) the trinitarian sense right  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2196) uh he died for your sins and this is  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2199) explicit in  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2200) um  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2201) in the new testament you'll see it and  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2203) this is a bit controversial but  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2207) some scholars think that for example the  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2209) gospel of luke doesn't actually  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2212) support this doctrine because the new  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2214) testament  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2216) which is a large portion of what  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2218) christian doctrine is based on  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2220) has different authors the reality is  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2222) some of them have different ideas  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2225) so some of them think that the doc the  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2227) gospel of luke doesn't actually support  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2229) this idea of  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2231) atonement for sins  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2233) in the way that somebody like paul does  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2235) in his  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2237) writings in the new testament or even  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2239) mark or matthew  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2241) so  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2243) but  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2244) in christianity in the religion of  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2247) christianity and the way that it's  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2249) taught  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2250) most of the time it's going to be  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2252) presented as  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2253) jesus christ who's god on earth came  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2256) down and he died for your sins now what  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2259) that means is  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2260) that  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2261) um  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2263) and this is where we get into the sort  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2265) of the  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2266) more details about it there are  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2268) different theories of what christ's  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2270) death burial and resurrection actually  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2274) means and and and we're going to get  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2275) into that in a little bit  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2277) but the the basic idea is that okay  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2281) christ came to die for our sins because  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2284) we couldn't live up to the law of the  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2286) old testament it was so difficult for  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2289) people to actually live up to that law  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2292) and nobody can do that nobody can  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2294) perfectly  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2296) live up to the law and to be in god's  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2298) presence we have to be made perfect so  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2301) christ had to come and die for our sins  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2304) in order to put us in a right standing  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2306) and relationship with god  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2309) also he had to come and defeat death  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2312) because christians have this idea of  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2314) original sin with adam and eve that when  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2316) they committed that sin in the garden  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2319) that that is what brought uh death into  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2322) the world and so that you don't die  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2325) because of natural causes or something  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2327) like that you you literally die because  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2330) of sin sin is why people die right so  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2333) christ also had to come and conquer  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2335) death  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2336) he also had to come and conquer the  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2339) corrupt human nature that we now possess  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2342) in light of original sin this this  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2345) doctrine that because adam and eve  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2347) sinned and it gets passed down through  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2349) the lineage and the human natures that  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2351) everybody possess are corrupted christ  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2353) had to come to perfect that human nature  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2356) so there are many different aspects of  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2358) it but in general the idea is that we  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2361) are right with god  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2363) if we confess that jesus christ is our  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2366) lord and savior and we repent of our  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2368) sins then we're we're basically going to  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2371) go to heaven this is their basic idea so  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2375) let me just try to understand this so  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2377) from this what you're saying is a number  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2380) of things there's a number of aspects in  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2382) terms of how they view sin first one is  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2385) you can't fulfill  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2388) your your standards your ability to get  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2391) right with god is impossible because god  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2394) is perfection and you're imperfect yeah  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2396) you just can't get there yeah there's  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2399) that inability  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2401) and the second thing you're saying is  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2404) that  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2404) death is the punishment for sin  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2408) so you've got this like you know  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2410) according to christians they believe  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2412) that  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2413) you know uh adam alice  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2416) and eve that uh that they committed sin  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2419) that's it  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2420) if you commit sin the only punishment uh  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2423) the only the only  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2424) uh yeah the only punishment you're going  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2426) to receive is death there's no way  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2428) you cannot get out of this this is it  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2430) god has said punishment for sin is death  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2433) and so as a result then there's this  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2437) the christ figure  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2439) which fits in so how does this christ  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2441) figure then bridge these two gaps it  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2444) just reminds me of these two key gaps  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2447) isn't it  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2448) you can't get right with the infinite  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2449) perfect god  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2451) and the punishment for sin is death  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2454) therefore we're all sinners  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2457) because of we're all born sinful  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2459) therefore there's no way of escaping  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2461) death so therefore we need  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2464) this was it substitutionary  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2466) atonement yeah is this where it comes in  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2469) yeah  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2470) yeah um  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2472) so  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2473) one example of this idea is in you can  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2476) find it in second corinthians  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2479) chapter 5 verse 21  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2482) where it says i'm reading from the  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2483) english standard version says for our  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2486) sake he made him  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2488) and speaking it's it's speaking of god  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2490) made him speaking of uh  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2493) jesus christ  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2495) uh to be sin who knew no sin  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2498) so that in him we might become the  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2501) righteousness of god so this idea that  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2505) jesus who was sinless  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2508) he didn't know any sin  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2509) he became sin meaning that he took on  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2512) the sins of the world  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2514) so that in him in christ we might become  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2518) the righteousness of god so this idea  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2520) that christ  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2522) took on the sins  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2524) of humans  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2526) right a perfect man took on the sins of  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2529) humans so that we would be able to  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2532) become and have  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2534) the righteousness of god or for the sake  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2536) of this discussion be able to have that  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2538) ability to have salvation with god so  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2541) that's the idea um and part of it for  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2544) them very importantly is the idea that  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2547) christ was sinless he wasn't a sinner  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2550) and for many of them he was god on earth  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2552) right so it's actually god coming and  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2556) dying for sins so that we don't owe this  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2559) debt or payment  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2563) to god himself  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2567) so uh abdul rahman if you want to jump  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2569) in just feel free to jump in and show  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2571) that yeah so i'm just trying i'm trying  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2572) to understand this now so  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2575) uh  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2576) so basically you've got this idea that  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2581) god had to be the only one that could  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2584) sacrifice that could pay the debt god is  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2587) perfect so he needed a perfect sacrifice  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2590) and that's impossible for a human being  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2593) so therefore it'd have to be god himself  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2594) that had to come to earth to sacrifice  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2597) himself  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2598) in order to pay for the debt of humanity  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2600) is that right  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2601) yeah yeah that's the basic idea but  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2603) obviously there are caveats and  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2607) their different understandings of  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2609) christ's death but  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2611) that's the basic idea and the one that's  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2613) you're going to find uh  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2615) most when he's when you speak to  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2617) christians and then the second aspect of  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2619) that is that because god did this  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2622) perfect sacrifice  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2624) of death  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2626) took on the punishment of death  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2628) that therefore god could fulfill the his  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2631) promise that sin  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2633) the the the punishment for sin is there  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2636) god could actually punish sin  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2640) by death  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2641) by  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2642) uh reincarnating onto this earth  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2646) dying for the sins of people and  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2648) therefore says right okay that's payment  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2650) is that right yeah  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2651) yeah yeah i mean  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2654) and early on people don't actually know  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2657) uh uh there was a theory held  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2660) um in which  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2662) the payment was actually not made to god  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2665) it was actually made to satan to the  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2666) devil you see but that's a whole nother  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2669) can of worms but let's just say that  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2670) it's made to god  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2672) god himself is dying because  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2675) it's like you can think of it like this  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2677) in modern terms it's like everybody's  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2679) got a negative bank account  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2681) and no matter what you do  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2684) you can't even get to a zero balance  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2687) forget about getting to a million  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2689) dollars you can't even get to a net of  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2692) zero everybody's in the negative so god  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2695) needs to come along  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2696) and die for us in order to get us to  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2700) that you know positive balance or at  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2702) least to a net of zero  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2705) everybody's in the negative  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2707) but  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2708) in this case and i know it's kind of a  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2710) crude way of saying it but he's paying  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2712) himself  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2713) um  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2714) because unless you want to say that he's  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2716) paying the devil or somebody else but  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2718) that's  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2718) even worse you see so um but yeah that's  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2722) the idea  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2723) okay so  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2724) are there different theories regardless  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2726) of this issue of atonement then because  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2728) you said obviously the issue of paying  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2730) the devil you said that jesus became sin  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2734) yeah he actually had then had the sinful  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2737) nature what  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2738) what's the particular model sorry  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2741) oh yeah so  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2742) no i don't think that um people  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2746) understand it in that literal sense of  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2748) that he literally took  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2750) you know he literally became sinful  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2753) um not christians don't understand it  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2755) that way but what they do  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2757) they understand it more in a in a  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2760) metaphorical sense that  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2762) he took on the sins of people basically  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2766) that um  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2768) not that he literally became guilty  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2771) um  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2772) he became a representation of the scene  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2774) yeah yeah he's basically a  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2775) representation to to stand in between  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2779) he's a mediator you see because you have  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2781) that in the new testament where it says  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2784) that christ jesus is the one mediator  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2786) between god and men so he sort of steps  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2789) in between and plays that role  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2792) but speaking on the different theories  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2795) not everybody understands christ's death  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2797) as a substitutionary atonement you also  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2800) have other models and unfortunately we  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2802) don't  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2803) we don't have a lot of time to go into  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2805) detail but i just want people to know  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2808) that there are other conceptions of  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2810) christ's death that are not necessarily  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2812) this common understanding that we hear  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2815) of substitutionary atonement one example  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2818) and this is just one example is this  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2820) idea that's called the christus victor  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2823) model  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2824) and the christus victor model  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2826) really doesn't have much to do with  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2829) christ's pain  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2831) a penalty for our sins or this or that  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2834) or this substitutionary atonement that  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2836) we were guilty so he had to die for us  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2839) no this idea of christus victor mainly  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2843) is that  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2844) in christ's self-sacrificial act  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2848) he became a paradigm of  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2851) what it was like for somebody to be  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2854) merciful and to be loving and  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2856) self-sacrificial  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2858) and he became that figure that  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2860) christians should look at  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2862) and  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2864) implement into their life you see but it  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2867) was not in the same sense as how we  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2869) understand it or many christians portray  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2872) today  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2872) as this substitutionary atonement is  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2875) it's totally different  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2877) so i want just want people to keep in  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2879) mind that there are other models like  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2881) this christus victor model or ransom  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2884) theory  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2885) are governmental theory and all these  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2887) different other theories to have  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2889) slight differences between them uh but  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2892) actually the christus victor model was  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2894) very  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2895) i would say very influential and  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2897) somewhat popular on in the early church  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2900) and later especially through the  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2902) protestant reformation  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2904) a lot of these ideas kind of became  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2907) filtered out and what we hear commonly  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2910) today is  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2911) uh what's called penal substitutionary  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2914) atonement uh and that's that's just one  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2917) theory of christ's death  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2919) and um so yeah anyway we unfortunately  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2921) don't have time  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2924) yeah so it is substitutionary atonement  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2925) the standard like mainstream i mean i  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2927) know it is today maybe but uh like when  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2930) we're speaking about orthodoxy is there  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2932) like a particular model or are these  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2934) like later philosophical  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2936) considerations that that  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2938) that are derived from orthodox beliefs  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2942) um  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2944) so i mean the question of orthodox is  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2947) tricky because it depends who you ask  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2949) but  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2950) for protestants definitely  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2952) penal substitutionary atonement  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2955) is the most um  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2957) most popular  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2959) and would be considered orthodox for  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2961) them  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2962) for  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2963) uh catholics  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2965) um  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2967) it's a little bit different some of them  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2969) like to hold to this governmental theory  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2973) and then eastern orthodox is a little  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2975) bit different as well  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2977) but what you'll see is that a lot of  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2979) times it's not so  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2982) it's not that they contradict one  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2984) another these theories but many times  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2987) they  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2988) choose to emphasize  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2990) one particular point over another you  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2992) see so um for example  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2996) eastern orthodox really emphasized this  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=2999) idea of theosis or this idea that um  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3003) basically humans are going to become  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3005) gods or godlike  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3007) and that is achieved through the death  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3010) burial and resurrection of christ  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3012) and it's a lot about um  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3015) sort of  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3016) uh taking over and um  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3020) not a payment to the devil but basically  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3023) this notion that their jesus came to  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3026) conquer death and restore our human  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3029) nature  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3030) so it's a bit it's very restorative in  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3034) the fact that christ came to restore the  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3037) human nature to the original state that  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3039) adam was  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3040) before he sinned it's not so much as  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3043) much about paying for the sands and this  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3046) idea of  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3047) of christ is punished because of us  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3050) type of deal and it's not as much about  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3052) that it's more restorative in nature  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3056) so just as so  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3058) how does this relate because obviously  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3060) you've got  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3062) jesus dying for people sins  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3064) yeah the penal substitutionary theory or  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3067) atonement  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3068) how does that relate to an ordinary  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3071) person or ordinary christian self uh  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3073) seeking salvation does he have to do  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3075) anything does he  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3077) does he have to do works does he have to  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3079) have beliefs what is it what's the  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3080) relationship between the two  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3083) yeah so  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3084) for for catholics and again this is  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3086) gonna be because there's some diversity  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3088) in christianity  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3090) for catholics they do have this idea of  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3094) works not that the works necessarily  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3097) merit  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3098) the salvation because they still believe  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3100) that it's through grace and through  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3103) christ's death on the cross  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3105) but at the same time  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3107) the the the works are important so they  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3110) go to and you can look up you'll see  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3112) debates between chris um like  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3114) protestants and catholics they go to the  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3116) book of james  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3118) where  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3119) james actually says that faith without  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3122) works is dead you see and  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3125) this was such a problem for protestants  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3128) like martin luther that he didn't even  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3131) like the book of james he actually  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3133) doubted its authenticity it was such a  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3136) it was such a big problem for him uh the  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3138) book of james and so  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3139)Music 
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3141) yeah for some for some people like  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3143) catholics and this is why they have all  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3145) these different  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3146) sacraments and and things that they have  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3149) to do  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3150) because  
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3151) in reality  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3153) uh and also that's why they have i think  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3156) it ties in this idea of purgatory which  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3160) is a place  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3161) not the same as heaven because they have  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3163) this division i know i'm kind of mixing  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3166) a lot of these things together but they  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3167) have this division of sins of sins that  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3170) basically  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3172) are are deadly sins so to speak and then  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3174) ones that are minor sins  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3177) if you commit those are if you are  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3179) committing those deadly sins just  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3181) because christ died doesn't mean oh  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3183) you're you're just going to go to  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3184) paradise they don't believe that  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3186) but for protestants it even though they  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3189) want to deny that maybe in word uh as  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3193) well in reality i think that's what  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3195) their position results in reality is  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3197) christ died for you all of the sins that  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3199) you committed if he tru if you truly  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3202) believe in him  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3203) all those sins are  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3206) metaphorically nailed to the cross  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3208) and so there's nothing that god can  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3210) really hold you accountable for because  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3212) christ paid the penalty for all of them  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3215) you see so there is a division between  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3218) how the protestants understand it and  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3220) how the catholics and orthodox  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3222) understand it they're a little bit more  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3224) work related whereas the protestants um  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3227) not so much it's almost like this uh  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3230) what you call anti-nomian doctrine which  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3233) is basically you can do whatever you  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3235) want and i know some people are going to  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3237) say well jake you're misrepresenting and  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3239) blah blah blah but honestly i think  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3241) that's the reality of it  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3243) so okay so from what i understand really  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3246) quickly then so for an ordinary  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3248) christian they have to believe in  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3251) jesus being god jesus as god coming down  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3255) onto the earth jesus dying for the sins  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3258) of human beings if they don't believe in  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3260) that  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3261) you know then that says  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3262) irrespective what they do and what else  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3264) they they believe in they're not gonna  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3267) be saved yeah yeah you're done yeah yeah  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3270) and then there's there's two groups  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3274) there are two general camps within  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3275) christianity  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3276) one which is related to uh works  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3280) uh  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3280)Applause 
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3282) i think from my understanding what  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3283) protestants basically say is that there  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3285) is a transformation in the individual  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3287) yeah the individual transforms because  
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3290) he's accepted jesus now  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3292) uh you know who's god and died on the  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3294) cross he transforms into this  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3296) you know angelic type character yeah  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3299) this you know this godly like character  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3302) yeah and so his good actions are just a  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3306) manifestation of god transforming him  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3309) and then with the catholics and the  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3311) protest the orthodox they believe that  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3314) there is some sort of transformation but  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3316) they also believe that you're still  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3317) going to be held accountable for your  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3318) actions and you therefore need to focus  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3320) upon your actions  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3322) and i think that's probably why we sort  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3324) of see within catholics and orthodox  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3326) christians there's a lot more emphasis  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3329) on adhering to tradition whereas for the  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3332) protestants it's like it pretty much  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3334) seems like anything goes really in terms  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3337) of  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3338) you know how they worship and what they  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3339) do  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3340) you know what they eat all these such  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3342) things just you know  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3344) they don't really have a you know  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3346) laws or regulations in that context and  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3349) even within the catholics and orthodox  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3351) there's  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3352) relatively minimal aspects relate to  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3355) that yeah so if i got that sort of  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3358) yeah and i think i mean  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3360) obviously it's an over generalization  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3362) but i think  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3363) we can kind of see that play out is that  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3366) um  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3367) the relations between i think anyway  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3371) muslims and uh catholics tend to be a  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3374) bit better than with protestants and i  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3376) think it does have something to do  
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3378) um with this idea but  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3381) yeah so okay so this  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3384) so sometimes what christians try to do  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3386) is they try to present the penal  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3388) substitutionary atonement  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3391) as though it's a necessary rational  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3394) just thing and that what they then argue  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3396) is they argue that the muslim position  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3399) is actually a logically incoherent  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3401) position  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3402) that god how could god just forget  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3405) they're like how could god just forgive  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3406) your sins  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3408) yeah you sinned against an infinite  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3410) creator there's no way that that would  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3412) be unjust for god  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3414) to say you know that he's he's he's just  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3417) he's  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3418) obviously they don't use the word idol  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3420) but he's just yeah so therefore how  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3422) could god being just simply forgive a  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3426) person of their sins so they said they  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3428) try to present it as though it's just a  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3430) rational position  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3432) that they you know it's just a logical  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3434) rational position  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3436) yeah and the question is is it rational  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3440) and just i don't think it is i mean to  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3442) say that and you have to understand what  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3444) i just described how they view christ  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3447) they view him as a sinless innocent man  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3450) he didn't do anything wrong in order to  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3452) even die from the beginning he died for  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3454) everybody else well is it rational and  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3457) just  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3458) for an innocent man to die for the sins  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3462) of all the guilty  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3464) well in what world in what world does  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3466) that make any sense not to me at least  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3469) so i mean i'm happy to hear what you  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3470) guys have to say about that but i don't  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3472) think  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3473) that an innocent person  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3475) dying for the sins of all of the guilty  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3479) i don't think that's rational i don't  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3480) think that's just if if somebody and we  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3482) can think of this in  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3485) our court system if somebody kills  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3488) somebody else do we say oh you know what  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3490) his buddy feels bad for him so he said  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3493) you know what there's something wrong  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3494) with this guy why don't you kill me  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3496) instead of him no nobody's going to go  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3499) for that nobody's going to be  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3501) happy with that we're not gonna give the  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3502) death penalty or life sentence to this  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3505) other guy just because he felt bad for  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3507) his friend who went out and shot all  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3510) these people no it doesn't work like  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3512) that and so i don't think from an  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3514) intuitive perspective it makes any sense  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3517) for a an innocent person  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3520) to be put to death  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3521) for everybody the else that is guilty of  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3523) these crimes and sins against god but  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3526) jay what i i had a thought there  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3529) could i just push jake on the point yeah  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3531) yeah yeah go ahead i i i i don't mind if  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3533) you want to come in before yeah jake is  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3535) a no no no okay well go for it first but  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3537) the issue is this is that  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3539) god has to punish sin  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3542) yeah god this is what the argument would  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3544) be god has to punish them to be just you  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3547) can't just arbitrarily say okay well you  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3549) know this person who committed the exact  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3551) same sin  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3553) it's another person that that person  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3555) will be forgiven without facing any  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3557) punishment but this person will face  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3559) punishment surely that's problematic  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3562) this is what their argument would be  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3566) yeah i don't think that's what happens i  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3568) don't think god just arbitrarily says oh  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3571) i like sharif you know  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3573) he  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3574) he looks nice today so he's going to go  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3576) to heaven i don't think  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3577) i don't think that's what happens  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3579) but  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3581) i do what i do think is happening i  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3584) think god is judging people justly  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3587) and he's not saying well okay let's take  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3591) this innocent person and we're going to  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3593) punish him  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3595) because this other guy committed a  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3597) heinous act or a crime no i don't see  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3600) how that makes any sense but in the same  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3603) sense each individual person  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3606) everybody's going to be judged uh justly  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3608) it's not going to be this arbitrary  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3610) thing and the idea that sin needs to be  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3613) punished well where do you get this idea  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3615) from you have and and this is kind of  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3617) skipping ahead but we have so many  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3619) things and even in the bible in the old  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3621) testament specifically in which god  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3624) forgives people who repent he doesn't  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3627) require a sin sacrifice whether it be a  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3630) human or an animal people repent and  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3634) turn to god and say wow we really messed  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3637) this up and we want to get right with  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3639) you and they turn and they change their  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3641) lives around and they start doing the  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3643) right thing  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3644) and what what happens god forgives them  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3647) in fact there are many places in the old  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3649) testament where he says i don't delight  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3651) in sacrifice i don't even like this  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3653) stuff i appreciate a repent heart that's  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3656) what i really want  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3658) and even with the animal sacrifices in  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3660) the old testament it wasn't just the  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3662) animal sacrifice that was more symbolic  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3665) representation of what was supposed to  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3668) be happening if the person actually did  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3671) not turn and repent correctly with their  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3674) heart and god knows that whether they  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3676) did or not  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3677) it wasn't accepted it wasn't efficacious  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3680) the the animal didn't do anything  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3682) it's like if somebody uh performed the  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3686) sacrifice uh for example whether it be  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3688) on yom kippur or another type of sin  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3691) sacrifice  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3692) if the person didn't accept it or they  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3694) said they did but they actually didn't  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3696) repent and turn away from their from  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3699) their wicked ways it was of no good it  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3701) didn't do anything you see so god  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3704) doesn't need to punish somebody whether  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3706) it be an animal in our place or another  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3709) human that's not what it's about it's  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3712) about repenting to god and turning  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3714) around and doing good deeds that's what  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3717) it is  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3718) so so i think  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3719) what what i sort of sense when  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3721) christians talk about this issue of  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3723) being being rational and you know you've  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3725) got this logical incoherencies that  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3727) they're smuggling in a lot of  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3729) presuppositions  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3731) and they're using this as a way to sort  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3733) of  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3734) superimpose this upon  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3736) as though this is a rational idea like  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3737) for example the punishment of sin is  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3740) death well nothing in islam says that in  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3742) fact the opposite it says that  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3745) every person who commits sin if they  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3748) don't repent they're punished the idea  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3751) is that there's a caveat that there is  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3753) still opportunity to repent  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3756) the second issue is that well okay  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3759) just because you accept god it's like  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3762) incarnated and sacrificed  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3765) and therefore you're given this grace or  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3767) mercy  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3768) you know it does you're still a finite  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3771) limited sinful human being that has been  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3773) you know forgiven quote by god because  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3776) of a particular set of beliefs well okay  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3778) yeah but we're saying the same thing but  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3780) not because of this particular idea of  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3782) believing that god incarnated but rather  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3785) we believe that you know you know the  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3787) correct set of islamic beliefs and  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3789) righteous actions that that gives us the  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3791) ability to gain uh gain the salvation  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3794) and the reward so  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3796) you know there's a lot of things that it  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3798) sounds like that the christians are  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3799) smuggling in to try to make it sound as  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3801) though it's a rational that you know god  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3804) can't you know forgive uh without um  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3808) you know without some sort of punishment  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3810) being enacted  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3812) that that only comes  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3814) i could accept it if in the islam if in  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3817) islam it says in the quran it says god  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3820) has to punish or god makes a promise  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3822) that he will punish every single sin  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3825) yeah  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3826) irrespective of whether you repent or  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3828) not  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3829) then then you've got a logical  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3830) incoherency here isn't it but it never  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3833) says that within within islam so to  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3836) superimpose a christian doctrine upon  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3838) islam and then say that you're being  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3841) irrational then that's just simply  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3843) you know smuggling in their own  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3845) presuppositions regardless of this i  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3846) know you've touched upon it but i just  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3848) wanted to uh just you know ask the  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3851) question about you know this this idea  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3853) of salvation is it really in conformity  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3856) with  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3856) the old testament the torah  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3859) jewish understanding  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3860) you know that this idea that you know  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3863) because again some christians what they  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3864) do is they always point to this idea of  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3866) animal sacrifice that this is the only  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3868) way  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3869) that the people prior to jesus were able  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3872) to get forgiven so there's always a  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3874) sacrifice that took place this is now  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3876) the perfect one  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3879) yeah no i i don't think it's in  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3881) conformity with the old testament you  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3882) can look at uh and i'm just going to  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3884) rattle some of these off because we are  
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3886) we come in going on for an hour and we  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3888) got a couple more questions you can look  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3890) at ezekiel chapter 18 you also can find  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3893) in the book of deuteronomy i think it's  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3895) chapter 24  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3897) where it mentions that the sons for  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3899) example shall not be put to death for  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3902) the fathers and vice versa every man  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3905) shall be put to death for his own sin  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3907) which means what the people are punished  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3910) for what they do people are not punished  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3912) for what other people did instead of  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3914) them also you find in the old testament  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3917) that it rails against human sacrifice  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3920) this idea of human sacrifice  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3922) is just absolutely abominable to the god  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3925) of the old testament  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3927) also even the  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3929) sacrificial system of animals in the old  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3931) testament jews understood that as being  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3934) for unintentional sins for those sins  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3937) that they committed unintentionally or  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3940) didn't even know about this is what  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3942) these sacrifices were for it wasn't for  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3944) murder if you went out and killed  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3946) somebody or you stole something from  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3948) somebody or you committed adultery with  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3951) somebody's wife you didn't just kill an  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3954) animal and everything was all good it  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3955) doesn't work like that so that's that's  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3958) another thing also  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3960) you find numerous examples in the old  
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3962) testament of god forgiving people  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3965) without the need of a sacrifice for  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3967) example the whole story of jonah and we  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3970) know  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3970) muslims what happened with the story of  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3972) jonas somewhat similar  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3975) that what everybody actually repented  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3979) and god forgave them when jonah went  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3981) back  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3982) god forgave them because they repented  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3985) an entire nation or people were forgiven  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3988) without a sacrifice and we we can go on  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3991) and on there are numerous examples where  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3994) sacrifices are not not only not uh  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=3997) necessary they're not even um  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4000) uh  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4001) liked like god talks about in the old  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4003) testament that i don't delight in these  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4006) sacrifices i don't even want them what i  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4008) want is a repent and contrite person i  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4011) don't care about these sin offerings  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4014) so no i do not think that it is in  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4016) conformity with the old testament  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4019) just to remind also the audience just  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4020) really quickly we're going to be going  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4022) shortly we just got a couple of more  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4024) points that we want to raise before we  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4026) go to the audience we get people to call  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4027) in  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4029) you know if you disagree with what we're  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4030) saying you want to challenge it  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4031) inshallah you'll have the opportunity  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4034) so  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4035) but uh just to quickly move on are we  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4038) jacob we addressed uh was jesus's death  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4040) necessary for salvation  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4042) yeah i do want to make one point on that  
[1:07:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4044) the on because there's really there's  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4046) only one other question here  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4048) the the other question about do all new  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4050) testament authors agree on soteriology i  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4054) said earlier that  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4057) scholars say that  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4059) paul has this idea of how we  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4062) you know how christ died for our sins so  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4064) does for all appearances mark and  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4067) matthew and john seem to as well  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4070) but luke on the other hand does not seem  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4074) to endorse this doctrine of  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4077) atonement that christ dies literally had  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4080) the substitutionary atonement that he  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4082) dies for our sins the reason that they  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4085) think this is because  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4087) uh most scholars believe that mark was  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4089) the first gospel written in which  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4092) matthew and luke  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4093) used as a source for writing their  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4096) gospels and we're able when we line  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4099) these three gospels up side by side and  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4101) that's why they're called the synoptic  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4102) gospels because they're more or less in  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4105) sync whereas john is the seen to be the  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4108) final gospel that was written and  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4111) it's a bit different it has totally  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4113) different stories  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4114) uh seemer seemingly higher christology  
[1:08:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4117) and theology when it comes to christ  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4120) any but anyway  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4121) um  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4122) matthew and luke  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4125) we can see because they're using mark as  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4127) a source we then compare how they tell  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4130) the same stories that mark had and we're  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4132) able to see that there's an editing  
[1:08:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4134) process that sometimes goes on for  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4137) whatever reason luke did not seem to be  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4140) down or have the same understanding of  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4143) this idea of atonement that mark and um  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4148) matthew's gospel did matthew seems to be  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4151) holding more closely to uh mark's  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4154) theology in that regard and luke edits  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4157) out  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4159) some of the sayings in mark's gospel  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4161) that portray that and he does not uh  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4164) tell the story the same way he leaves  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4166) them out all the time so um that was  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4168) just a quick remark on that that uh and  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4171) i can give quotes maybe later if need be  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4174) from scholars saying that luke doesn't  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4176) appear to have this idea of  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4178) substitutionary atonement going on in  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4180) his gospel  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4182) um  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4183) and then on the last point here about uh  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4187) death being necessary for salvation or  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4189) not i actually want to share my screen  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4192) and read a section here  
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4195) from uh  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4197) thomas aquinas who's the doctor of a  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4199) chur of the church of the catholic  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4201) church that is  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4203) where he answers this question because  
[1:10:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4205) what happens is many christians say  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4208) christ needed to come and die for our  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4210) sins it was absolutely necessary there's  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4212) no other possibility there's no other  
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4215) way that god could have done that well  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4217) in actual fact there's what muslims call  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4220) ektilaf on this issue even amongst  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4223) christian theologians and scholars some  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4225) believe that it was absolutely necessary  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4227) some believe that it wasn't thomas  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4229) aquinas answers the question uh quite  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4232) directly and he says no that it wasn't  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4234) so um let me just pull it up here i  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4237) think my screen is sharing now right  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4241) um  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4241) so this is in the summa which is he  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4244) of the third part question number 46  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4247) uh you'll see here was it necessary for  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4250) christ to suffer for men's deliverances  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4253) and you'll see on he's got objections  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4255) here and responses to them  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4258) now  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4259) he says here  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4261) um  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4263) objection number one look it would seem  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4265) that there was no uh was was there  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4268) article two let me start here actually  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4270) whether there was any other possible way  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4272) of human deliverances besides the  
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4274) passion of christ meaning besides christ  
[1:11:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4276) dying  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4277) it would seem that there was no other  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4280) possible way this is an objection of  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4282) human deliverance is besides christ's  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4284) passion for our lord says john 12 24  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4288) amen amen i say to you  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4291) unless the grain of wheat falling into  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4293) the ground dieth  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4295) itself remaineth alone but if it die  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4299) it bringeth forth much fruit and it goes  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4302) on and lists other objections so the way  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4304) that this book is constructed for those  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4306) who don't know uh he'll bring a question  
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4309) he'll bring what people uh were  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4312) either hypothetically or maybe they're  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4314) real people who are actually saying  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4315) these things and then he'll respond to  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4318) the objections so he responds to this  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4320) question where somebody is seeming to  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4322) assume this he says  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4324) on the contrary augustine says  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4327) and he quotes augustine here and he does  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4329) this many times he quotes augustine  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4331) we assert that  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4334) uh we assert that the way whereby god  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4337) ordained to deliver us by the man jesus  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4340) christ who is mediator and i brought up  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4343) this concept before mediator between god  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4345) and men  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4346) is both good and befitting the divine  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4350) dignity but  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4352) let us also show that other possible  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4355) means we're not lacking on god's part to  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4358) whose power all things are equally  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4361) subordinate so he's saying there is  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4363) another possibility even though it was  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4365) good and be fitting for god to do this  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4367) there let's not get it confused there  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4369) are other possibilities he says i answer  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4371) that a thing may be said to be possible  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4375) or impossible in two ways  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4377) first of all simply and absolutely or  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4380) second from supposition therefore  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4382) speaking simply and absolutely it was  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4385) possible for god to deliver mankind  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4388) otherwise than by the passion of christ  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4391) because quote  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4392) no word shall be impossible with god and  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4395) he cites luke 1  
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4397) so he's quite clear  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4399) on answering this question  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4401) that uh christ there could have been  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4403) another way that god could have  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4405) reconciled man with god  
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4411) just like look at uh jake should we uh  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4414) jump to any guests

[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4526) maybe kind of  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4527) i didn't know hey go ahead yeah i i put  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4530) it in the chat in the beginning but you  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4531) know when the chat it's hard to see you  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4533) won't you're limited to what like 200  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4534) characters so i'm just going to like put  
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4536) it out here now what y'all think about  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4537) it and whatnot and whatnot oh my  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4540) goodness  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4543) so  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4544) when we were talking about like shirt  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4546) being the unforgivable sin  
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4548) so going back like pretty far in the  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4550) beginning what i always understood was  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4553) that  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4554) the shirt by definition by associating  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4556) partners with god it's essentially  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4558) calling him not absolutely powerful or  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4560) not absolutely forgiving not absolutely  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4562) and then in any in every sense  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4564) essentially that's what shirk is and so  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4566) implicitly that means that the person is  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4569) uh saying that god uh hasha is unable to  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4573) forgive everything and so therefore  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4576) removes the uh  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4578) the uh  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4579) the the you know  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4581) how can i put that he removes that  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4584) notion that  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4585) he negates the notion that god can  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4587) forgive or anything and therefore puts  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4588) himself in the position of not asking  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4589) god to forgive everything of him and  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4592) that's in a sense why it's unforgivable  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4594) it's  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4595) unforgivable from the uh person who  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4597) commits shirk's perspective  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4601) yeah no jesus i think that was a point  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4603) where i had to come off the stream  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4604) because i was lagging but i i wanted to  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4606) mention uh one or two points regardless  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4608) of the issue of shuriken in origin if  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4610) you don't  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4611) seek repentance from shirk  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4614) then you never forgive it yeah this is  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4616) the the origin within islam but  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4618) obviously regards to the other sins that  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4621) if you don't seek repentance from the  
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4622) major sins  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4624) then you will be punished  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4627) for it and punishment may be hellfire  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4629) for a period of time but then the idea  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4632) is that if you still have the  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4633) fundamental belief in tahit that you'll  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4635) be ultimately forgiven  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4636) yeah but i think let's just move on to a  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4639) tangelo because i think he's been  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4640) waiting for  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4642) for a while so  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4645) angelo how are you hello guys uh  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4648) yeah  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4652) uh you're choppy on my end i don't know  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4655) for everybody else a little bit choppier  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4657) here as well but we can assume  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4659) yeah but we can i think we can sort of  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4661) get  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4662) understand most of what you're saying  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4666) angelo  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4668) yeah try to say something now buddy  
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4670) yeah i try yeah i try to change hide  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4673) here okay that's all about unfortunately  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4675) yeah it's better that's better actually  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4677) yeah you're coming clearly now okay  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4681) okay so um i think you guys are talking  
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4684) about the very central and very  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4686) important topic  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4688) which is forgiveness and of course we  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4690) all aim to be forgiven as uh as muslims  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4694) believe in allah we christians also  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4696) believe that god is real but the big  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4700) question here of course is how can we  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4702) actually expand eternity but  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4706) and i think we both based on what  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4709) we fear very different  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4711) views  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4713) and um  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4715) uh  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4716) i i i see it like a transaction  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4720) that  
[1:18:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4721) is very clear in 1 corinthians 6  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4723) 20 where it says  
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4725) for you were both at the price  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4729) therefore glorify in your body and in  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4731) your spirit which are gods and with both  
[1:18:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4735) what it means what this means by that  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4738) this acts 20 28 therefore take heed to  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4741) yourselves and to all the flock among  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4743) which the holy spirit has  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4746) made you overseers to shepherd the  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4749) church of god which he purchased with  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4751) his blood  
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4753) okay and in matthew 20 28 just as the  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4756) son of man did not come to be served but  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4759) to serve and to give his life a ransom  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4763) for many  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4764) so  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4765) um this is very clear  
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4768) here it speaks about the transaction  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4770) where god  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4773) is for our sins  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4775) he takes what other  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4777) effects  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4781) okay carry on  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4783) you're back yeah so  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4786) i got  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4787) to stop pay the price  
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4794) giving that  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4796) as a gift from god that we can be saved  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4799) so this is very clear  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4804) it is very strange to me it is as if um  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4806) for example um  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4809) giving  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4810) um someone  
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4812) tortures  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4814) rapes and kills your daughter  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4819) to you you are the father of that  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4821) daughter and then he whines and says oh  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4824) i am so sorry for what i did and that  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4827) the father will say oh you are sorry  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4829) well  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4836) yeah so  
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4838) it's a good question and i think we want  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4839) to address some of the key points we're  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4842) going to keep you on so you can respond  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4843) as well  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4844) so but i just want to understand a few  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4846) few  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4847) quick issues  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4848) do you believe that the  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4851) the the salvation the the theory of  
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4854) salvation within christianity is  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4856) rational what i mean by rational is that  
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4858) even without christian text  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4861) it would be logically necessary or do  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4864) you think it's just something that's a  
[1:21:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4866) scripturally  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4867) uh based  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4872) view um i think that sorry  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4876) you're breaking up sorry you're breaking  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4878) up slightly  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4882) is it better than that yes but no yeah  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4887) second you're saying okay so  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4891) okay so i quote you from uh  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4894) first corinthians it says for the  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4896) message of the cross  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4897) is foolishness to those who are  
[1:21:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4900) perishing  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4901) but to us who are being saved it is the  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4905) power of god  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4906) so  
[1:21:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4907) um  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4910) which  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4911) is not a christian  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4914) but you understand  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4919) you're breaking up really really bad  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4921) it's very difficult to make up what  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4922) you're saying so  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4924) yeah you're breaking up but from what i  
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4925) understand what you what you're  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4926) basically saying is  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4928) that the idea of salvation for a  
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4931) non-christian would seem foolish  
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4934) but it's not foolish  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4936) but would the idea of salvation within  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4940) the christian paradigm  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4941) would it be something that's  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4943) you could come to you could arrive at  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4946) prior to any religious  
[1:22:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4949) basically prior to the  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4950) new testament would you be able to  
[1:22:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4953) understand it prior to maybe jesus  
[1:22:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4955) coming would the early you know uh  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4959) with the the jewish followers of the old  
[1:22:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4961) testament would they  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4963) be aware of this idea of salvation or is  
[1:22:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4966) it something that's they weren't aware  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4968) of and it only came about  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4970) after jesus's uh appearance on earth  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4976) well  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4977) i am not sure if they  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4979) knew that their sacrifice system  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4983) was just a shadow  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4985) of what  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4989) was but  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4991) i mean uh let's suppose that you have  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4994) someone  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4995) which transgresses um a red light and is  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=4998) brought  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5012) and then  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5016) will be condemned to go to jail  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5019) and the judge feels compassionate about  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5022) it and pays the price and pays fine for  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5025) that person and that person goes free  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5028) is that is there something irrational  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5030) unjust  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5034) in the church doing that  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5036) okay so a good really good question i  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5038) wanna you know get jake bring jake in  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5040) and just what is i'm just trying to  
[1:24:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5041) understand your particular positioning  
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5043) so  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5044) in origin you're saying that the jews  
[1:24:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5046) who followed the old testament wouldn't  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5048) really have known anything about  
[1:24:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5051) how to achieve salvation prior to jesus  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5054) they may have had some sort of  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5055) foreshadowing but they would have had  
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5056) this notion that if you seek repentance  
[1:24:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5060) you could be forgiven like the people of  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5062) jonah  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5063) that  
[1:24:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5064) uh you know if you're  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5066) trying to get right by god that you try  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5068) to do it you know through being sincere  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5071) and having correct belief and do good  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5073) righteous actions are you upholding the  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5075) law uh for the jews they would  
[1:24:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5078) understand it from that perspective then  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5079) there was a there was a there was a  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5081) change  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5082) yeah in terms of or an addition  
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5085) from your perspective which is obviously  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5087) not actually no this is the real way of  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5090) achieving salvation uh regardless the  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5093) the the final question i was going to  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5095) ask you before bringing jake to respond  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5097) to two of your key points  
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5100) is what about um  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5103) a baby who dies  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5105) and therefore doesn't have the ability  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5107) to acknowledge that  
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5109) jesus died for their sins  
[1:25:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5113) would they be saved or would they not be  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5115) saved  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5116) yes of course  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5118) mercedes will be saved and i am not the  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5120) calvinist which believes that  
[1:25:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5123) um  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5124) all people are predestined and that we  
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5127) cannot actually uh uh  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5129) do anything in regards of our eternal  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5132) destination i don't believe that  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5134) and i think the if if god would  
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5138) um  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5140) predestine a baby which cannot make any  
[1:25:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5143) moral judgment to eternal hell that  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5147) would be an absolutely atrocious and  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5150) understand  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5152) deity  
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5153) and i would i don't believe that yeah so  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5155) i'm going to bring in jake here so i  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5156) don't know if jake you want to respond  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5158) to maybe that particular point or some  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5160) of the questions that you also asked the  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5161) question real quick  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5163) because i think the jake exchange is  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5164) going to go on for a while i just  
[1:26:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5167) because uh  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5168) let's hang along confused me a bit there  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5170) when he said that um  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5172) the doctrine is gonna seem confusing uh  
[1:26:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5174) or  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5175) you know foolish to to the unbelievers  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5179) uh but then but then you came  
[1:26:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5181) on the call here with the intent of of  
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5184) uh demonstrating that it's reasonable by  
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5186) saying that for example the uh the whole  
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5189) rapist analogy that you gave and his  
[1:26:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5191) forgiveness was seemed to be an attempt  
[1:26:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5194) to  
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5195) demonstrate the reasonableness of your  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5198) position  
[1:26:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5199) so  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5200) but how could you do that if the bible  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5202) is already telling you that it  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5204) necessarily is going to be foolish to us  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5206) i mean  
[1:26:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5207) what's the point yes if you listen yes  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5209) if you if you listen to richard dawkins  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5213) and he um  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5215) he rejects uh women  
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5222) it's very difficult to hear yo tangelo i  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5223) don't know if you can do something about  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5225) the connection but it's impossible to  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5226) hear you but i heard richard dawkins  
[1:27:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5228) there and i'm  
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5231) i'm i'm for for unbelievers too so it's  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5233) not just richard dawkins um so  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5236) i guess the point is kind of cut out too  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5238) abdul and it seems like everybody's  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5240) having connection problems man what's  
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5242) going on  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5244) it's weird i'm sorry yeah  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5246) so  
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5247) guys  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5248) what you were saying basically was that  
[1:27:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5250) richard dawkins denies the cross  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5252) therefore all of this would seem  
[1:27:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5253) ridiculous to him but for versus no i  
[1:27:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5256) just gave an example yeah so i just gave  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5258) an example but we i mean you guys deal  
[1:27:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5262) often with atheists and you know  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5264) um  
[1:27:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5265) that they they think that the entire  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5268) um  
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5269) gospel is nonsensical so we see many  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5272) many people which reject it it's not  
[1:27:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5275) just richard dawkins i just mentioned  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5277) him because he is a prime example and he  
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5280) is very outspoken against the decision  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5283) of the  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5285) of  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5285) the gospel but i think the first of what  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5288) abdul rahman is saying is that you gave  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5290) two or you attempted to give two  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5293) rational or reasoned arguments to try to  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5297) justify without an appeal to scripture  
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5299) per se  
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5300) one was to say well would a father  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5303) forgive the rapist of his daughter and  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5305) the second one was related to the fact  
[1:28:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5307) that well if a judge brings a person who  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5310) can't afford it he may pay the money  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5313) to him so that he can then pay it uh pay  
[1:28:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5316) the particular fund that seemed quite a  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5318) reasoned  
[1:28:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5319) uh position now we can obviously explore  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5322) that a bit further to see if it is  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5323) reasoned but it's an attempt on your  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5326) part at angelo to present your position  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5330) that this is a reasonable position and  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5332) then say well the other position is  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5334) actually not reasonable yeah the slime  
[1:28:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5336) position no i'm not saying it's not i'm  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5338) not saying it's not reasonable what i  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5340) say  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5341) is that what the bible says  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5344) be what we  
[1:29:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5346) see  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5347) that  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5348) um the gospel  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5350) listen to me  
[1:29:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5353) but based on what i explained i think it  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5356) is not  
[1:29:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5357) unreasonable and it is also not unjust  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5361) i think that all kinds of sins  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5365) has to be punished in order to have  
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5367) justice okay i'll bring in jk jake  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5373) yeah i i just want to address the  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5375) question because he read that text  
[1:29:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5377) earlier but if you read a few verses  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5379) down  
[1:29:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5380) in  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5381) first corinthians chapter  
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5384) this is chapter 1  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5386) says in verse 23 it says but we preach  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5389) christ crucified onto the jews a  
[1:29:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5393) stumbling bl block and onto the greeks  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5397) foolishness  
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5399) so for the jews it's a stumbling block  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5401) towards them them it doesn't make any  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5403) sense it's not something that they saw  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5406) in their old testament texts as being  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5408) prophesized and for the greeks who  
[1:30:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5411) actually seek out after wisdom the text  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5414) says it's foolishness why because it  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5416) doesn't make any sense  
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5418) and so that's what we're i mean i don't  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5420) know about want to represent everybody  
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5421) but that's what i'm saying i'm saying  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5423) yeah it is foolishness to say that an  
[1:30:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5426) innocent person should die for the sins  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5428) of all guilty people is irrational it is  
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5432) foolishness and the fact that the author  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5435) of the text is actually anticipating  
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5438) that and admitting that to me is very  
[1:30:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5440) telling  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5443) yeah i mean  
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5445) as i said  
[1:30:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5447) to god it's not foolish it is the way  
[1:30:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5449) that he established in order to grant us  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5453) forgiveness  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5454) when christ was in gethsemane  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5457) and he said to the father father if  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5459) possible let it this cup  
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5463) go that i don't have to drink it  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5466) then  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5467) the father didn't grant his prayer  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5470) so christ had to go through it and he  
[1:31:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5473) went through it  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5475) and  
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5477) he was tortured and crucified in the  
[1:31:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5479) most  
[1:31:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5483) so  
[1:31:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5485) in the most painful way  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5488) so basically  
[1:31:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5489) in the new testament that  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5491) for god that was necessary in order to  
[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5495) be able to forgive us  
[1:31:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5497) so  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5498) um who are you or  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5501) who are you  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5514) why  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5516) it just seems like an assumption  
[1:31:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5519) you're just saying that god can't you're  
[1:32:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5521) saying that god can't forgive sin  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5523) without a punishment but he does it all  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5525) the time in the old testament so why was  
[1:32:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5527) he doing it  
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5529) i would i would say it is not just that  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5532) it would be not just  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5535) but the bible is very clear that we are  
[1:32:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5538) sinners  
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5539) and um if we die and come to god  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5544) then he will say okay  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5546) the price of your sins is death and that  
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5549) is very clear in the bible god cannot  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5551) have  
[1:32:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5559) do community what is wrong what is evil  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5562) so  
[1:32:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5563) there had to be a high spate  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5566) and christ paid it and it was as it as i  
[1:32:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5570) as i wrote it was a transaction for you  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5573) were both at the price  
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5576) therefore glorify god in your body so  
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5578) christ he paid the price on the cross  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5581) paying for our sins and we were  
[1:33:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5584) purchased through his own blood so  
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5588) to me that is  
[1:33:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5597) you you cut out at the end i think i got  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5599) most of it but uh i still don't see why  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5603) it's necessary when as i said  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5605) in the old testament god forgives sins  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5609) without requiring a sacrifice and  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5613) without requiring jesus as a sacrifice  
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5616) so i just don't see where you get this  
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5617) idea i mean i mentioned earlier all of  
[1:33:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5620) the people of jonah what where was the  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5621) sin sacrifice for them they were  
[1:33:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5623) forgiven because they repented  
[1:34:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5643) yeah we have another person here we have  
[1:34:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5645) another person here waiting  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5647) um you can try to speak maybe one more  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5650) time buddy but it's it's just  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5652) it's not even intelligible at this point  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5656) okay we can't hear so um the the the  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5659) sacrificial system in the old testament  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5663) where animals animals were killed  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5666) they did not actually remove sins  
[1:34:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5669) what they did is they covered sins in  
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5672) the way that god didn't see them  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5675) but they were actually paid when christ  
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5678) died on the cross so that christ didn't  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5680) pay only for the  
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5682) of the people that came after him but he  
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5686) paid also the price for the same  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5688) things of the people he lived before him  
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5692) in the old testament the forgiveness  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5695) became effective to his sacrifice  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5700) yeah but that's a back projection that's  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5703) anachronistically looking back on the  
[1:35:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5705) text of the old testament and making  
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5707) that claim but from the jews perspective  
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5710) they were forgiven in fact god says they  
[1:35:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5713) were forgiven  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5714) and he says in numerous places and you  
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5717) have in psalms chapter 50 you have in  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5719) numerous places where god says i don't  
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5721) delight in sacrifices i delight in a  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5724) contrite heart he doesn't he doesn't say  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5726) he needs this sacrifice  
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5728) and i even read from thomas aquinas  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5730) there where he doesn't say it's  
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5732) necessary he says that if god wanted to  
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5735) he could have done it in another way he  
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5736) just chose to do it this way  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5739) well it was good and fitting but he  
[1:35:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5741) didn't have to do it that way  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5743) yeah the thing that he says that he does  
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5745) not delight in sacrifices sacrifice that  
[1:35:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5749) doesn't mean that it is not necessary  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5754) if he would not see it as necessary  
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5756) christ would not have come to suffer on  
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5759) the cross  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5760) for our sins  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5764) yeah but again that's just begging the  
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5765) question because you're that's the very  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5767) thing that's in question you're just  
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5769) assuming it already and what you  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5771) mentioned earlier actually about mark uh  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5773) not mark but it's mentioned in  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5776) several different gospels the story when  
[1:36:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5779) jesus went and prayed to the father  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5782) you have in uh you have in mark's  
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5784) version  
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5785) where he doesn't ask the question  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5788) it's actually a command he said in mark  
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5791) chapter 14 verse 36 and he said abba  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5794) father  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5796) all things are possible onto you  
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5800) take away this cup from me  
[1:36:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5802) nevertheless not what i will but what  
[1:36:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5805) that will but the point is he makes the  
[1:36:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5807) statement to the father he says all  
[1:36:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5810) things are possible for you and then he  
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5812) doesn't ask him he gives a command he  
[1:36:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5815) says take away this cut from me so if  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5818) jesus had to do this and you also  
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5821) believe that jesus is god how did he not  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5823) know that he was supposed to die in the  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5825) cross  
[1:37:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5826) why was he telling the father to take  
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5828) the cup away from him  
[1:37:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5830) well that was his human desire because i  
[1:37:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5833) knew that what was in front of him would  
[1:37:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5836) be big suffering  
[1:37:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5838) but then in the end he said not my but  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5840) you will  
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5842) shall happen and it was the will they  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5844) have the same will  
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5847) well christ he was in  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5850) human nature and  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5851) of course um he had the  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5854) desire not to go through this suffering  
[1:37:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5857) but um the father  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5859) and they knew that's not as human  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5862) it's not his human nature doesn't talk  
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5864) he says not what i will i is referring  
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5868) to the person  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5869) it's the person of christ who's saying  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5871) this  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5873) yes but he was in flesh he was also  
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5875) human  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5876) and he was subdued to  
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5879) human suffering and that was an  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5881) expression of the suffering that he was  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5884) going through  
[1:38:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5885) knowing that he would have to go all  
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5888) through this pain  
[1:38:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5890) yeah but if he knew that he was going to  
[1:38:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5892) have to do it why is he  
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5894) complaining about it  
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5897) well because i mean it was an expression  
[1:38:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5899) of his human situation where he knew  
[1:38:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5902) that he would have to go through big  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5904) suffering and of course he he didn't  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5906) want it but he know  
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5908) it was necessary in order to pay the  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5911) price for ourselves  
[1:38:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5914) to save us if christ was god and god  
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5917) wants to reconcile all men to himself  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5920) why didn't he want it  
[1:38:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5921) because he knew it what it was going to  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5924) be big suffering which he in his human  
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5927) situation um he i mean nobody wants to  
[1:38:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5931) be tortured like he was so he didn't  
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5934) want it but he had to go through it  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5937) the price for our sins and to pay uh to  
[1:39:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5940) pay the price in order to save us  
[1:39:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5943) yeah i just don't see how in the world  
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5946) you can say  
[1:39:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5947) that it's only christ's human nature  
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5949) when he is saying in the text abba  
[1:39:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5952) father all things are possible unto you  
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5955) take away this cup from me and then he  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5958) says i not my will but your will he's  
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5961) using personal pronouns and there's only  
[1:39:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5964) one subject or person in christ so can't  
[1:39:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5967) be just merely ascribed to his human  
[1:39:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5970) nature it's a scribe to the person of  
[1:39:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5972) christ who was also god  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5976) yes as you know i believe in the trinity  
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5978) in three persons one substance so  
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5982) he was expressing a desire to the father  
[1:39:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5986) which was not granted because it was  
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5988) necessary that he would die on the cross  
[1:39:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5990) in order to save all  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5992) uh  
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5993) humanity and that was necessary and  
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=5996) that's why he went through it  
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6001) yeah i don't know if you guys want to  
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6002) come in if you have any comments because  
[1:40:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6004) we got two other people waiting  
[1:40:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6007) uh yeah i was just gonna just um  
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6011) i just wanted to ask so are you saying  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6013) that  
[1:40:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6014) prior to  
[1:40:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6016) uh jesus  
[1:40:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6018) the uh  
[1:40:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6020) the people followed the old testament  
[1:40:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6022) would have understood that repentance  
[1:40:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6024) would have been sufficient or even  
[1:40:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6026) animal sacrifice would have been  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6027) sufficient or do you think that they  
[1:40:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6029) wouldn't have  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6033) well if they follow the law of the old  
[1:40:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6036) testament then they  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6039) they will be they are safe they will be  
[1:40:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6040) saved and  
[1:40:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6042) there is a system of  
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6044) sacrifice in the old testament that they  
[1:40:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6046) had to obey  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6048) and if they did obey it then their  
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6050) salvation was granted but as i said  
[1:40:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6053) previously i think that the animal  
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6056) sacrifices do not remove sins  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6059) the only sacrifice which removes sin is  
[1:41:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6062) christ's uh dying on the cross yeah but  
[1:41:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6065) angela i'm trying to understand that  
[1:41:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6066) you're trying to say that  
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6068) the  
[1:41:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6069) original  
[1:41:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6070) so the people prior to jesus who  
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6072) followed the torah  
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6074) they were saved by following the law  
[1:41:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6076) they were saved by repentance they were  
[1:41:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6078) saved by animal sacrifice  
[1:41:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6080) yeah they weren't saved because they  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6082) believed that jesus died for their sins  
[1:41:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6085) is that correct  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6086) yes that's yes that's correct they they  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6089) were saved because they obeyed the  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6091) mosaic class so then the question then  
[1:41:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6092) becomes  
[1:41:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6093) well if  
[1:41:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6095) if then you're now saying  
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6097) but in origin they weren't actually  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6100) saved  
[1:41:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6101) they're all that's not what i said no no  
[1:41:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6103) no that's not what i said i said that  
[1:41:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6105) animal sacrifices  
[1:41:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6107) they are just a symbol of what were to  
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6111) come god basically he covered the sins  
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6114) of these people he didn't see them  
[1:41:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6117) because there were these animal  
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6119) sacrifices which were a symbol  
[1:42:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6122) of the real sacrifice which was  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6125) to come which was christ dying on the  
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6127) cross for all humanity yeah but angela  
[1:42:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6130) did they understand did they know do  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6133) they think no actually this isn't  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6135) sufficient what we need is god to  
[1:42:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6137) incarnate himself upon the earth and  
[1:42:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6139) then kill himself or he'll be sacrificed  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6142) you know and then me believe in it in  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6144) order for me to  
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6146) be saved do they they did they  
[1:42:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6148) understand that  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6149) yeah you know i believe in um  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6152) in a incremental  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6154) revelation of god which  
[1:42:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6157) connected with christ becoming man with  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6160) god himself becoming men yeah but angela  
[1:42:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6163) you seem to be sort of evading the point  
[1:42:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6165) the question would be not did it  
[1:42:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6167) progress  
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6168) later on but did those original people  
[1:42:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6171) be prior to jesus who followed this one  
[1:42:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6174) would they have understood exactly what  
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6177) you believe now is absolutely necessary  
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6180) for all of humanity past present and  
[1:43:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6183) future to be saved  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6185) would they have believed that  
[1:43:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6188) well i am not sure if they understood  
[1:43:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6191) what i just explained now  
[1:43:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6193) what i believe nonetheless is that if  
[1:43:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6196) they uh obeyed and followed the mosaic  
[1:43:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6199) law  
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6200) then they were saved okay so  
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6203) why is it then considered illogical and  
[1:43:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6206) unreasonable for the islamic position  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6208) because that's what you initially said  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6210) because in essence what the prior  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6213) position was is very much closely  
[1:43:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6215) aligned to the islamic position which is  
[1:43:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6218) that if you are following the law  
[1:43:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6221) you have the correct belief yeah you  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6224) yeah i believe in one god you  
[1:43:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6227) uh you know sacrifice when it's  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6230) necessary for you to do like for example  
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6232) we have sacrifices on the day of hajj  
[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6235) and  
[1:43:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6236) even throughout the year as well you can  
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6238) do as well and you repent to your lord  
[1:44:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6241) that that is sufficient for  
[1:44:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6243) for salvation that would have been the  
[1:44:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6245) exact same position  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6248) as those people who followed the old  
[1:44:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6250) testament and the old testament prophets  
[1:44:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6252) so if it wasn't illogical for them or  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6255) irrational for them it wouldn't be  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6257) logically rational for a muslim either  
[1:44:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6259) would it  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6260) well  
[1:44:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6262) for instance is that  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6264) christ already came he gave the  
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6266) sacrifice which by  
[1:44:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6269) this very clear is the one which is  
[1:44:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6270) necessary that we accept that  
[1:44:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6274) he surrendered christ and he said i am  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6276) the truth  
[1:44:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6278) the way  
[1:44:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6279) and life  
[1:44:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6280) nobody comes to the father then through  
[1:44:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6283) me and that means  
[1:44:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6285) that his sacrifice is essential it is  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6288) his sacrifice that paid the price for us  
[1:44:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6292) to be saved  
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6294) now  
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6295) it's not necessary anymore that you do  
[1:44:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6298) what you just  
[1:45:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6302) my point is this is my point is this is  
[1:45:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6305) that  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6306) that your position is a position based  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6309) upon what you possibly presume to be  
[1:45:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6311) divine scripture that's fine you can  
[1:45:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6314) hold that particular position we can  
[1:45:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6315) have a discussion later on about that  
[1:45:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6318) but initially what you were trying to  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6320) argue is that it was irrational  
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6323) to hold the position that the islamic  
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6325) position was  
[1:45:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6326) which is different when you're saying  
[1:45:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6328) it's irrational means that there's a  
[1:45:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6330) standard which is logical and rational  
[1:45:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6333) which all human beings whether they  
[1:45:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6335) lived prior to the revelation given to  
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6338) jesus or jesus's life  
[1:45:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6340) or after jesus that they would have  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6342) understood that they would have  
[1:45:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6343) understood that repentance  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6345) you know belief in one god  
[1:45:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6348) doing fulfilling the law that these  
[1:45:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6350) things would have been sufficient that's  
[1:45:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6352) not irrational for them you can turn  
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6355) around and say well now we have the  
[1:45:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6357) scripture that we believe is divine that  
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6360) therefore says we need to now believe in  
[1:46:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6362) you know x position x belief  
[1:46:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6365) you know and if you don't do it that's  
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6367) fine but you can't say that our position  
[1:46:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6368) is irrational you can just simply say  
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6370) goes against my  
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6372) presuppositions about what i believe is  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6374) scripturally correct  
[1:46:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6376) well the difference sheriff is that  
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6378) there is always a sacrifice involved  
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6382) also in the old testament muslim  
[1:46:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6384) sacrifices  
[1:46:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6386) muslim sacrifice every year muslim  
[1:46:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6388) sacrifice and uh on the day of dave  
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6392) david  
[1:46:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6395) okay i i don't understand your  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6398) religion sufficiently in regards if  
[1:46:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6401) these sacrifices somehow  
[1:46:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6403) um  
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6404) should should  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6406) be something that allah looks upon and  
[1:46:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6408) then say grants you salvation because of  
[1:46:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6411) these sacrifices but what i know  
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6414) is that these sacrifices  
[1:46:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6417) they are in my understanding not  
[1:47:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6420) necessary anymore because god already  
[1:47:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6423) gave  
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6424) himself through christ as the perfect  
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6426) sacrifice which removes the sin of all  
[1:47:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6430) humanity and yeah  
[1:47:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6432) that's fine you can say it's not  
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6433) necessary now i the law has been  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6436) abrogated according to your particular  
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6438) position you can say that that's fine  
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6440) but that's a scriptural argument you're  
[1:47:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6442) you're arguing that you know your  
[1:47:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6444) scripture says x  
[1:47:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6446) yeah and therefore  
[1:47:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6448) b if look if i turn around and i say my  
[1:47:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6451) scripture says this and then i can't  
[1:47:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6453) turn around and say you're irrational  
[1:47:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6455) and illogical in your position i can  
[1:47:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6457) only say that if you accept my scripture  
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6461) yeah and then that we have an argument  
[1:47:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6462) and discussion and debate about which  
[1:47:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6464) scripture is correct and he's a divine  
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6466) authority if you if you don't accept it  
[1:47:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6469) then you're holding on to your  
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6470) particular tradition and scriptural  
[1:47:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6472) tradition i'm holding on to my  
[1:47:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6473) particular tradition in scriptural  
[1:47:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6475) position and that's fine you can have  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6477) that but i can't turn around and say  
[1:47:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6479) just because you don't adopt my  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6481) particular scriptural position that  
[1:48:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6483) you're being irrational or illogical if  
[1:48:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6487) we've not had the discussion about why  
[1:48:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6489) the scripture is correct in the first  
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6490) place  
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6491) i i just don't see i i look you gave the  
[1:48:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6494) analogy you gave the analogy of the  
[1:48:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6496) father who forgives uh the rapist or  
[1:48:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6499) murder of his daughter or son  
[1:48:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6501) and you're saying well that's irrational  
[1:48:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6503) well it's not irrational because that's  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6504) exactly how  
[1:48:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6506) the jews who followed the old testament  
[1:48:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6508) prior to jesus understood how god would  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6511) forgive you know secondly you give the  
[1:48:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6514) example about the judge and again you're  
[1:48:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6516) saying well this is reasonable well it  
[1:48:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6518) wasn't reasonable because that's not how  
[1:48:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6520) the jews who followed the old testament  
[1:48:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6522) understood  
[1:48:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6524) so both of those positions they don't  
[1:48:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6526) seem to be grounded upon rationality  
[1:48:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6529) they just seem to be look i have a  
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6531) scriptural presupposition  
[1:48:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6533) therefore i'm trying to  
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6535) uh you know that's the reason why i  
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6536) believe it  
[1:48:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6539) well i disagree with you here i think i  
[1:49:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6542) understood that  
[1:49:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6544) um salvation  
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6547) comes through obeying the mosaic law  
[1:49:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6552) okay um what else did you say  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6556) yeah but we we we would say we would say  
[1:49:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6558) as muslims we would say  
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6560) four yes yes  
[1:49:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6564) oh god  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6567) yes i'm sorry  
[1:49:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6568) and the other thing is that i hear jake  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6571) very clearly saying  
[1:49:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6573) that allah can simply  
[1:49:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6576) forgive  
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6577) a muslim  
[1:49:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6578) without sacrifices just one thing comes  
[1:49:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6581) to allah and says okay i repent for my  
[1:49:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6584) sins  
[1:49:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6586) and say okay come into heaven it's all  
[1:49:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6588) right  
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6591) and angelo at angelo jake gave the  
[1:49:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6594) example of jonah  
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6595) and the people of jonah  
[1:49:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6597) to say that what was their sacrifice  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6600) were they forgiven just for repentance  
[1:50:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6604) that's what i am talking about yeah but  
[1:50:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6606) then he's given the answer of saying  
[1:50:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6608) christ died and everything is going to  
[1:50:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6610) be back projected onto people in the  
[1:50:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6613) past so it's really an unfalsifiable  
[1:50:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6615) theory because anything you appeal to  
[1:50:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6617) into old testament even if there was no  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6619) sin sacrifice you're going to say christ  
[1:50:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6622) took care of that and it's back  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6623) projected so you you really can't get  
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6626) anywhere with that comment  
[1:50:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6629) okay but i would like to have a  
[1:50:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6631) clarification here can you come to to  
[1:50:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6635) allah when you die  
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6637) and then be forgiven with an with any  
[1:50:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6640) precondition and any anything whatsoever  
[1:50:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6644) you did no you need to simply say to you  
[1:50:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6647) okay you are forgiven no you need  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6648) repentance  
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6650) okay so you can just say oh i am sorry  
[1:50:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6652) for what i did and then he says come  
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6654) here  
[1:50:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6656) do you think repentance doesn't come  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6658) after death  
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6659) yeah and also angelo do you think  
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6662) repentance is just simply somebody  
[1:51:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6663) turning around saying oh  
[1:51:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6664) i'm sorry judge you know please let me  
[1:51:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6666) up and just say okay then finally i will  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6668) let you off no of course it's not the  
[1:51:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6671) idea of toba the idea of repentance  
[1:51:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6673) within the islamic paradigm is that a  
[1:51:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6675) person feels absolute regret for what  
[1:51:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6678) they did that if they were to be placed  
[1:51:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6681) in the exact same position  
[1:51:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6683) yeah that they would not repeat the same  
[1:51:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6685) mistake yeah that they are seeking as  
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6688) best as possible to recompense the  
[1:51:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6691) mistake that they made through righteous  
[1:51:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6694) actions through repentance and that  
[1:51:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6696) therefore god knowing what is within the  
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6698) intention in the heart of a human being  
[1:51:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6700) would know that if he was placed in that  
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6702) same position he would not repeat it he  
[1:51:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6705) is therefore being sincere  
[1:51:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6707) yeah this idea so what happens yeah okay  
[1:51:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6710) so what happens with the the sins that  
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6714) that person has committed on that moment  
[1:51:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6716) of repentance well the sin is sin is  
[1:51:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6719) upon whom who is he sinning against  
[1:52:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6724) god allah right so god is forgiving it  
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6727) is he facing it  
[1:52:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6729) god doesn't have to punish every single  
[1:52:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6731) sin  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6733) so you are confirming exactly what i am  
[1:52:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6735) saying  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6737) no it's not that  
[1:52:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6740) what it is is that look at angelo you  
[1:52:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6741) believe that god has to punish all sins  
[1:52:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6743) yes  
[1:52:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6745) yes  
[1:52:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6746) why  
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6748) because it's just why is it just  
[1:52:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6752) because  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6753) um  
[1:52:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6754) could god not just forgive a person who  
[1:52:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6756) repents just forgives a person who  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6759) sincerely repents  
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6762) the question is would it be just a  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6764) tangible could you forgive a person can  
[1:52:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6767) you forgive a person without exacting  
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6770) punishment for that person can you do it  
[1:52:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6772) yes  
[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6773) yes i can do it now the question is  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6776) you're just person  
[1:53:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6781) i'm sorry  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6782) you broke up there  
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6784) yeah now the question is even if i can  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6787) do it is it just  
[1:53:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6789) are you so you're saying it's not just  
[1:53:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6791) for you to forgive people  
[1:53:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6794) that's not what i'm asking i am asking  
[1:53:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6797) is it just that someone  
[1:53:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6800) rapes tortures and kills your daughter  
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6804) for fun  
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6805) and then you say and then he comes to  
[1:53:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6807) you and says  
[1:53:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6808) sharif i am very sorry and he will whine  
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6811) in front of you and then you will say to

[1:53:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6817) do it again  
[1:53:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6819) what you're saying is another guy comes  
[1:53:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6822) in and says you know what i'm sorry  
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6824) about your daughter my friend you know

[1:53:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6828) want to take the punishment instead of  
[1:53:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6831) him even though i had nothing to do with  
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6833) it so i'm going to go to jail for him  
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6835) what are you going to say to him  
[1:53:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6839) well that is that is not what i am what  
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6842) we are talking about your doctrine no

[1:54:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6852) killed my daughter that's what you're  
[1:54:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6854) saying  
[1:54:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6856) shifting the girl you're saying somebody  
[1:54:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6858) has to be punished but guess what it has  
[1:54:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6859) to be an innocent person has to be  
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6862) punished  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6864) you are shifting the goal post jake what  
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6866) the hell oh that's what you're doing  
[1:54:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6869) now listen what i want to to know from

[1:54:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6874) yeah if someone does what they just  
[1:54:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6876) described and he comes to you and just  
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6879) whines and says oh i am very sorry for  
[1:54:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6882) it it's a person okay so angelo if a  
[1:54:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6884) person comes to me yeah and he's done  
[1:54:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6886) all these heinous crimes and he whines  
[1:54:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6888) to me they're not i'm not that's not  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6891) repentance though is it  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6893) yeah and there are by the way there are  
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6895) a tangent i don't know if you know but  
[1:54:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6897) there are cases yeah where a person has  
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6901) murdered somebody's family members  
[1:55:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6903) and the person the family member the  
[1:55:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6905) closest family member has turned around  
[1:55:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6907) and forgiven the murderer because they  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6909) believed that the murderer was sincerely  
[1:55:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6912) repentant yeah there are christians who  
[1:55:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6914) have done this  
[1:55:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6915) yeah are you saying that the christian  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6917) who did who forgave their murder the  
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6920) person who murdered their daughter or  
[1:55:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6922) their son was wrong to do so  
[1:55:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6925) was being unjust  
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6928) well all i can give you is very clear  
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6930) from the bible and i will quote here  
[1:55:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6932) from first timothy 2 5-6 for there is  
[1:55:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6936) one god and one mediator between god and  
[1:55:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6939) man the man jesus christ who gave  
[1:55:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6942) himself as ransom  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6945) for all  
[1:55:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6946) to be testified in due time  
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6949) okay and knowing that you were not  
[1:55:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6952) redeemed with corruptible things like  
[1:55:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6955) silver and gold  
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6957) from your aimless conduct received by  
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6959) tradition from your fathers but with the  
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6962) precious blood of christ as a lamb  
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6965) without blemish  
[1:56:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6967) and without spot  
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6969) so these are all terms used to describe  
[1:56:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6972) a financial transaction  
[1:56:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6977) i'm trying to understand though  
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6979) are you trying to make an argument say  
[1:56:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6981) this is what my scripture says  
[1:56:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6983) therefore i that's the reason why i  
[1:56:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6984) believe it are you trying to make a  
[1:56:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6986) rational argument are you're trying to  
[1:56:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6987) say no it's rational to hold on to this  
[1:56:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6989) particular position meaning independent  
[1:56:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6992) of scripture i can justify this  
[1:56:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6994) particular position using rationality  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=6997) and logic and reason  
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7000) because if you're just simply saying  
[1:56:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7001) this is my scripture then that's fine  
[1:56:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7003) okay that's your scripture i don't think  
[1:56:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7005) it's rational because of what jake said  
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7007) because it doesn't seem reasonable to me  
[1:56:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7010) that if a person commits sin that you  
[1:56:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7012) punish another person who hasn't  
[1:56:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7013) committed that sin it seems reasonable  
[1:56:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7015) to me that if the person commits sin he  
[1:56:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7018) bears the responsibility either he will  
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7020) be forgiven through his repentance and  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7023) say repentance because we believe god is  
[1:57:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7026) the most merciful and the most forgiving  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7029) yeah not human beings but god himself or  
[1:57:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7033) you know he will be punished by god yeah  
[1:57:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7036) and all of this would be considered uh  
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7038) justice for us whether god chooses to  
[1:57:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7043) uh forgive the person due to god's  
[1:57:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7046) knowledge of the person's sincere  
[1:57:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7048) repentance and therefore if he was  
[1:57:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7050) placed in that same situation he  
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7052) wouldn't do it or the fact that if god  
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7054) knows that this person is not being  
[1:57:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7056) sincere in his repentance or hasn't  
[1:57:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7058) sought repentance and that he will be  
[1:57:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7060) punished and that would also be  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7061) considered justice for us but the idea  
[1:57:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7063) that you know an innocent person has to  
[1:57:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7067) be  
[1:57:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7068) punished for the sins that somebody else  
[1:57:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7070) commits just it doesn't make sense to me  
[1:57:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7073) and a lot of muslims find it very  
[1:57:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7075) difficult and problematic  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7078) well i go with the revelation i believe  
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7081) that the new testament is true i believe  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7084) that jesus christ is the messiah  
[1:58:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7087) which was prophesied in the old  
[1:58:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7089) testament that would come it is also  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7091) very clear in josiah 53  
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7094) which says that christ would be  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7098) suffering the lamb would suffer for our  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7100) sins so that was foretold that it would  
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7103) happen so it is not about what i think  
[1:58:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7106) is rational it is about what god reveals  
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7110) to us  
[1:58:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7112) yeah i believe  
[1:58:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7115) that the new testament the bible is out  
[1:58:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7118) of brief that it is god's revelation and  
[1:58:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7121) that  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7122) we are  
[1:58:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7123) all to believe okay  
[1:58:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7125) let's read what the bible says let me  
[1:58:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7127) read for you what the bible says okay  
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7130) psalm 51  
[1:58:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7132) verse 16  
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7135) and 17  
[1:58:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7136) for thou disiest not sacrificed else i  
[1:59:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7141) would give it  
[1:59:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7142) thou delightest not in burnt offering  
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7146) the sacrifices of god  
[1:59:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7148) are a broken spirit a broken and  
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7152) contrite heart o god thou will not  
[1:59:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7155) despise  
[1:59:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7156) so what is he saying there the psalmist  
[1:59:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7159) is saying look god you don't care about  
[1:59:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7162) these sacrifices you don't want  
[1:59:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7163) sacrifices you want a contrite heart  
[1:59:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7166) this is the muslim position this is what  
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7168) the muslim is saying  
[1:59:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7170) so you're talking about scripture but  
[1:59:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7172) you're using a new testament lens to  
[1:59:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7175) back projected onto the old testament  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7177) when they're not in conformity you have  
[1:59:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7179) the same thing this is not just one  
[1:59:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7181) verse or jake uh cherry-picking you have  
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7184) the same thing in hosea chapter 6 verse  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7187) 6 what for i desire mercy which is what  
[1:59:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7191) we're saying muslims interestingly  
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7193) enough are our god i would argue is more  
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7197) merciful than yours for i desire mercy  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7201) and not sacrificed and the knowledge of  
[2:00:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7204) god more than burnt offerings so you  
[2:00:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7208) want to say oh you stick to the bible in  
[2:00:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7210) scripture but then when we quote these  
[2:00:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7212) things you have no answer for it you  
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7214) just go back to the new testament and  
[2:00:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7215) these things that paul said or  
[2:00:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7218) other people you're not dealing with  
[2:00:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7220) these texts  
[2:00:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7224) tv  
[2:00:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7225) the people of the old testament had an  
[2:00:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7228) understanding about what was to come i  
[2:00:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7231) can quote here you say 53 it is very  
[2:00:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7235) clear it says i'm surely here it's not  
[2:00:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7239) jesus our okay it surely he took up our  
[2:00:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7244) pain and pour our suffering yet we  
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7247) considered him punished by god stricken  
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7250) by him and afflicted but he was pierced  
[2:00:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7254) for our transgressions  
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7258) isaiah 53 when no because i'm responding  
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7261) we let you go on long enough actually  
[2:01:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7264) i'm gonna pull the plug on you at this  
[2:01:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7266) point because we've let you go on for  
[2:01:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7268) long enough you say that god cannot  
[2:01:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7271) forgive without sacrifice he can't do  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7273) this it's unjust if he doesn't forgive  
[2:01:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7275) without sacrifice and you say you want  
[2:01:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7277) to appeal to scripture which is not  
[2:01:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7279) you're not really presenting a rational  
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7281) point of view you're just appealing to  
[2:01:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7283) scripture then when i appeal to biblical  
[2:01:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7285) texts now you're going into the old  
[2:01:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7287) testament and trying to bring up isaiah  
[2:01:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7289) 53 which is a hotly contested supposed  
[2:01:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7293) prophecy of the messiah who was not god  
[2:01:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7296) in that text who was not who was  
[2:01:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7298) supposed to actually have a lineage and  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7300) all these things that  
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7302) prove that it wasn't actually jesus  
[2:01:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7304) christ which the author himself says  
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7306) that it was israel and other places but  
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7308) the whole point is when i just read  
[2:01:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7311) those two verses you didn't actually say  
[2:01:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7313) okay jake i hear what you're saying and  
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7315) then respond to them you just went to  
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7318) something totally different that had  
[2:01:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7319) nothing to do with it  
[2:02:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7321) jake i responded in regards of that  
[2:02:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7323) already god he was he is not pleased  
[2:02:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7327) in regards of sacrifices he wants that  
[2:02:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7330) people are just but that doesn't remove  
[2:02:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7334) the need for sacrifices to punish sins  
[2:02:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7338) it does it does he says i desire mercy  
[2:02:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7341) and not sacrifice  
[2:02:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7344) he is expressing his desires he is not  
[2:02:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7347) expressing necessity he's talking about  
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7350) his own mercy if his mercy is better  
[2:02:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7354) than sacrifice why would he choose if  
[2:02:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7357) god is to do the most perfect action and  
[2:02:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7360) require what is best why would he want  
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7362) something that is less than what he  
[2:02:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7364) desires why would he want to sacrifice  
[2:02:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7366) if he desires mercy god doesn't get what  
[2:02:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7369) he desires  
[2:02:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7370) yeah he is merciful he is graceful and  
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7374) he can  
[2:02:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7375) be that  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7376) because there is a punishment for sins  
[2:03:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7380) so he can be judged  
[2:03:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7382) and merciful  
[2:03:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7383) at the same time and before  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7386) i'd just like to quote here  
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7389) um josiah 53 if you permit and then i  
[2:03:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7392) will um leave time for others to to come  
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7395) in and interact is that okay  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7399) uh yeah if you quickly okay so yeah  
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7402) quickly so surely he took up our pain  
[2:03:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7406) and bore our suffering  
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7408) yet we considered him punished by god  
[2:03:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7411) stricken by him and afflicted but he was  
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7414) pierced for our transgressions he was  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7418) crushed for our inquities the punishment  
[2:03:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7422) that brought us peace was on him and by  
[2:03:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7426) his wounds we are healed we all like  
[2:03:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7430) sheep have gone astray each of us has  
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7433) turned to our own way and the lord has  
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7436) laid on him the inquity  
[2:03:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7439) of us all he has oppressed and afflicted  
[2:04:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7442) he was oppressed and afflicted yet he  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7445) did not open his mouth he was led like a  
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7448) lamp to the slaughter and as a sheep  
[2:04:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7451) before its shearers is silent so he did  
[2:04:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7456) not open his mouth  
[2:04:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7457) by oppression and judgment he was taken  
[2:04:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7460) away yet who of his generation protested  
[2:04:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7464) for he was cut off from the land of the  
[2:04:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7467) living  
[2:04:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7468) for the transgression of my people  
[2:04:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7471) he was punished  
[2:04:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7473) so i think this is very clear and it is  
[2:04:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7477) a one of the most powerful prophecies  
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7480) which was fulfilled in the messiah which  
[2:04:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7483) is jesus christ christ  
[2:04:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7488) yeah i think it's so obviously not jesus  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7490) christ also considering the fact that  
[2:04:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7492) there are what's uh called other servant  
[2:04:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7494) songs in isaiah in chapter 42 and  
[2:04:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7498) chapter 49 in which he explicitly states  
[2:05:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7502) that the servant who is mentioned  
[2:05:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7505) is israel  
[2:05:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7506) but we're just gonna throw that out the  
[2:05:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7508) window even though he just said it three  
[2:05:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7510) chapters earlier it has nothing to do  
[2:05:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7513) with it so anyway appreciate you coming  
[2:05:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7515) on but we're gonna have to move on to  
[2:05:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7516) the next person here

[2:05:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7532) neil castro jake that means that the  
[2:05:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7535) whole idea of jesus becoming a sacrifice  
[2:05:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7537) is completely a failed idea based on the  
[2:05:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7540) ver that verse of the book of prophet  
[2:05:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7543) isaiah  
[2:05:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7544) um  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7546) well i re i think you might be confused  
[2:05:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7548) with the one i was reading from hosea  
[2:05:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7551) uh hosea was the one i read but  
[2:05:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7554) yeah  
[2:05:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7556) so thank you for the super chat neil  
[2:05:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7559) um oh we've got john fisher 2.0 here  
[2:06:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7563) hey jake how was your time in morocco  
[2:06:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7566) that was good thank you  
[2:06:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7568) not too bad uh glad here so uh  
[2:06:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7571) yeah um soteriology is the topic of  
[2:06:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7573) discussion  
[2:06:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7575) yeah that's right  
[2:06:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7577) okay so as you know i don't take the  
[2:06:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7580) line that the sacrifice is strictly  
[2:06:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7582) necessary i do think that god could  
[2:06:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7584) forgive if he wanted to  
[2:06:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7586) or you know just take on a different  
[2:06:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7588) means of doing it but um  
[2:06:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7591) i do want to say one thing though i do  
[2:06:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7594) think that you could still make a  
[2:06:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7596) probabilistic claim or a claim that the  
[2:06:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7599) sacrifice that god does undergo with the  
[2:06:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7601) crucifixion is a more fitting one and  
[2:06:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7604) basically that's pretty much why it came  
[2:06:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7606) here to run that so if you guys want to  
[2:06:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7609) go down that path that's all good  
[2:06:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7612) yeah that sounds interesting yeah and  
[2:06:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7615) also um what your theory of atonement is  
[2:06:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7618) would be nice okay so the theory of  
[2:07:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7620) atonement that i take is  
[2:07:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7622) um  
[2:07:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7623) so it's the moral governance view um but  
[2:07:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7626) i take a a line where it's more centered  
[2:07:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7629) around the kingship of christ so  
[2:07:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7633) basically the idea is that god forms  
[2:07:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7636) covenants with his people  
[2:07:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7638) and these covenants are done  
[2:07:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7641) by means of having some kind of central  
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7646) sign of the covenants so the central  
[2:07:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7648) sign of the old testament was  
[2:07:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7649) circumcision that's how you entered into  
[2:07:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7651) the people  
[2:07:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7652) in the new covenant that is through  
[2:07:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7654) baptism and of course you have the other  
[2:07:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7656) sacraments as well  
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7658) in the old covenant you had other  
[2:07:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7660) sacraments or rights so basically animal  
[2:07:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7663) sacrifices in the temple were one sort  
[2:07:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7665) of  
[2:07:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7666) sacraments you also had marriages as  
[2:07:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7669) well in the new covenant you have  
[2:07:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7671) marriages you have other things but they  
[2:07:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7674) all but the difference between the first  
[2:07:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7676) and the second is  
[2:07:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7677) in the first they're forensic that means  
[2:08:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7680) that they only work by the means of  
[2:08:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7684) god not punishing people for sins so it  
[2:08:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7688) would be a sort of forgiveness that  
[2:08:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7689) would be exacted by god withholding  
[2:08:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7692) punishment or retribution  
[2:08:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7694) in the new testament the sin is actually  
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7696) cleansed from you by means of his grace  
[2:08:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7698) given through the sacraments by means of  
[2:08:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7701) the atonements so  
[2:08:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7703) going so  
[2:08:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7704) that's how it's done uh the sacrifice  
[2:08:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7707) done at cavalry its main purpose is  
[2:08:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7711) as a sign of two things the first is it  
[2:08:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7715) shows god's  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7717) hatred of sin in providing a just  
[2:08:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7719) punishment uh to jesus christ and christ  
[2:08:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7723) is  
[2:08:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7724) worthy of taking on this punishment  
[2:08:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7726) because he takes on the office of  
[2:08:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7728) king of all of humanity and the king and  
[2:08:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7730) the head of the church and the same way  
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7732) a king can be punished for the crime  
[2:08:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7735) of a nation so too can christ by  
[2:08:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7738) voluntarily taking up that position be  
[2:09:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7740) punished on our behalf as well and this  
[2:09:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7743) would be a second office that he takes  
[2:09:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7745) in addition to being the moral governor  
[2:09:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7746) of the universe  
[2:09:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7747) as god himself  
[2:09:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7749) and by doing so um  
[2:09:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7752) uh god in his  
[2:09:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7755) god inflicting this form of  
[2:09:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7757) punishment  
[2:09:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7758) removes the sin of everyone who has  
[2:09:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7760) binded themselves onto christ by their  
[2:09:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7762) baptism and through participating in the  
[2:09:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7765) sacraments themselves and that's what  
[2:09:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7768) makes this  
[2:09:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7769) a fitting  
[2:09:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7771) form of punishment  
[2:09:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7772) for one's sins so our understanding is  
[2:09:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7775) god does this because of its fittingness  
[2:09:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7778) because on the one hand he gets to  
[2:09:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7780) exercise the virtue of mercy  
[2:09:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7782) by means of  
[2:09:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7784) providing an alternative form of  
[2:09:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7787) of punishment for the person to undergo  
[2:09:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7789) rather than hellfire but on the other  
[2:09:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7791) hand it's done in proportion to the  
[2:09:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7794) crime um because the head of the church  
[2:09:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7797) or of the nation is punished instead of  
[2:10:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7800) the members so  
[2:10:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7801) um so you get both virtues actually  
[2:10:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7804) shown  
[2:10:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7806) and also you bind yourself to the church  
[2:10:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7809) you have a visible way of showing that  
[2:10:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7811) you are part of this community and  
[2:10:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7814) you also get god's grace as well and  
[2:10:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7817) it's also and it's fitting for two  
[2:10:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7819) reasons one it shows god's uh hatred of  
[2:10:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7822) sin in a visual way  
[2:10:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7824) through the crucifixion and the second  
[2:10:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7826) reason is  
[2:10:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7827) because god gets to suffer on behalf of  
[2:10:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7830) his people this is considered to be the  
[2:10:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7832) highest thing someone who exhibits the  
[2:10:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7835) virtue of being a king can actually do  
[2:10:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7839) so in the islamic tradition god is  
[2:10:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7841) considered  
[2:10:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7842) to be king that's one of his 99 names  
[2:10:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7845) i believe  
[2:10:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7846) and in the christian religion god is  
[2:10:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7848) also considered the king as well  
[2:10:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7850) um in fact if you look at  
[2:10:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7853) other kings i believe cromwell ii was  
[2:10:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7855) beheaded um because of the fact that he  
[2:10:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7859) wanted to keep his title his monarchy  
[2:11:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7861) and so did the people of england  
[2:11:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7863) and the and cromwell executed him  
[2:11:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7866) because he considered cromwell  
[2:11:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7868) considered his role as king to be  
[2:11:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7870) something of divine decree he thought it  
[2:11:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7872) was not just a civil thing it was also a  
[2:11:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7875) religious thing and it was not just  
[2:11:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7877) considered to be an act of fidelity to  
[2:11:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7880) his people it was also considered to be  
[2:11:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7881) an act of martyrdom as well fulfilling  
[2:11:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7884) god's will  
[2:11:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7885) and  
[2:11:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7887) and ask a question if how how you so  
[2:11:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7890) true so you're when you when you're  
[2:11:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7892) saying the king can be like can take on  
[2:11:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7894) a punishment right yeah um what's what's  
[2:11:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7897) the  
[2:11:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7899) what's the justification behind that  
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7901) right  
[2:11:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7902) yeah so god yeah so vicarious punishment  
[2:11:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7905) is something god can exact in both  
[2:11:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7906) religions i'll appeal to the islamic  
[2:11:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7909) texts so in the quran for example god  
[2:11:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7911) can actually request of abraham to give  
[2:11:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7913) up his son  
[2:11:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7915) um what i don't know isaac it's some i  
[2:11:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7918) think some minorities say isaac but the  
[2:11:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7919) majority is  
[2:12:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7921) ishmael he asks  
[2:12:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7923) of abraham to give up his son now if god  
[2:12:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7925) can ask of that on behalf of somebody  
[2:12:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7928) else who who himself has no sin afortier  
[2:12:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7931) i don't know why he couldn't ask the  
[2:12:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7932) guilty to hand over a king for example  
[2:12:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7936) so like i could just appeal to special  
[2:12:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7938) revelation there but  
[2:12:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7940) just i don't under i don't understand  
[2:12:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7942) the the link so  
[2:12:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7943) so so god asked  
[2:12:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7945) yeah yeah if you could if you could  
[2:12:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7947) elaborate on that i don't understand so  
[2:12:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7949) is right so god asked abraham to give up  
[2:12:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7953) his son isaac uh for death right in the  
[2:12:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7955) quran  
[2:12:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7958) oh yeah yeah okay  
[2:12:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7960) was god just was god being unjust in  
[2:12:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7962) doing that  
[2:12:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7965) um no no he was could  
[2:12:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7971) yeah could god have could abraham have  
[2:12:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7973) said um sorry god that is beyond what  
[2:12:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7976) you can ask of me you can't ask me to  
[2:12:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7978) turn over an innocent person to you  
[2:13:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7982) yeah so if god can ask um  
[2:13:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7985) if god can ask abraham to turn over his  
[2:13:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7987) son i don't i i'm not sure why god could  
[2:13:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7990) not ask you know entire people to hand  
[2:13:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7992) over their king uh for the sake of  
[2:13:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7994) punishment but why what's wrong i'm not  
[2:13:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7997) i mean what's  
[2:13:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=7998) where is the analogy like there's no  
[2:13:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8000) punishment in the king this is in the  
[2:13:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8001) case of adam uh sorry in the case of  
[2:13:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8004) ibrahim  
[2:13:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8006) so oh oh it's from oh it's an argument  
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8010) it's i think in mind it's called an  
[2:13:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8011) argumentum ad uh yeah an argumentum  
[2:13:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8015) afortyori so from the greater thesis so  
[2:13:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8018) if god can ask abraham to turn over an  
[2:13:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8021) innocent person  
[2:13:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8022) uh for death after tiara he can ask a  
[2:13:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8025) guilty people to turn over an innocent  
[2:13:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8028) uh person for death even if it is for  
[2:13:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8030) the case of punishment and  
[2:13:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8033) basically by justifying the stronger  
[2:13:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8035) claim i have justified the weaker claim  
[2:13:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8037) no but there's no punishment in the case  
[2:13:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8039) of ismail he's not being punished for  
[2:14:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8040) anything i mean god  
[2:14:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8042) god takes everybody's life i mean  
[2:14:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8043) there's no there's in in in the case of  
[2:14:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8046) prophet ismail  
[2:14:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8048) he's not being punished for anything and  
[2:14:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8049) prophet ibrahim killing him if it did  
[2:14:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8052) happen would be  
[2:14:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8053) by virtue of  
[2:14:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8055) ibrahim's knowledge absolute knowledge  
[2:14:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8058) of  
[2:14:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8059) you know the revelation that came to him  
[2:14:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8061) from allah so there's no difference  
[2:14:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8062) between allah taking the life of a  
[2:14:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8064) person and commanding a person and a  
[2:14:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8067) prophet in this case  
[2:14:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8068) to do that that's why  
[2:14:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8070) i just don't see how that can link to  
[2:14:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8075) the whole how you can make the jump from  
[2:14:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8077) that  
[2:14:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8078) to  
[2:14:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8079) justifying the punishment of an innocent  
[2:14:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8081) king on behalf of  
[2:14:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8083) his people  
[2:14:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8085) all right um so  
[2:14:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8087) right so  
[2:14:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8088) here's my question then one we're still  
[2:14:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8090) a bit confused actually about  
[2:14:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8093) the governmental theory in general um  
[2:14:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8096) all right i'll  
[2:14:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8098) just let me address abdul's thing first  
[2:14:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8099) then jake i'll get to your point second  
[2:15:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8101) all right so the fir all right so um  
[2:15:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8104) so abdul uh the question i would have to  
[2:15:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8106) ask you is why can god ask  
[2:15:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8109) an innocent person to turn over their  
[2:15:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8111) life  
[2:15:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8112) or an innocent person to turn over the  
[2:15:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8114) life of somebody else  
[2:15:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8117) because  
[2:15:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8118) all life belongs to god we don't think  
[2:15:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8120) death is a punishment all right does  
[2:15:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8122) christ's life belong to god  
[2:15:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8125) um yeah of course okay so you can  
[2:15:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8127) request that i don't really see any  
[2:15:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8129) i don't i don't okay so maybe you're  
[2:15:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8130) maybe i didn't hear the whole thing  
[2:15:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8134) but then that's um  
[2:15:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8136) that christ's life doesn't belong to god  
[2:15:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8138) and god can't take christ's life  
[2:15:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8140) right right so the question is whether  
[2:15:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8142) whether  
[2:15:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8144) substitutionary atonement makes sense in  
[2:15:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8146) the sense that does it really  
[2:15:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8148) you know render us um  
[2:15:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8151) you know pure and does it really do does  
[2:15:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8154) it really do justice in the case of you  
[2:15:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8157) know uh wiping away our sins and and and  
[2:16:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8160) uh you know retributing us for for for  
[2:16:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8162) whatever sense we committed that's why  
[2:16:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8164) i'm not trying to i want to get clear on  
[2:16:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8167) the the theory because i don't think it  
[2:16:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8169) actually says that  
[2:16:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8171) i don't think it's substitutionary in  
[2:16:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8173) that way  
[2:16:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8174) yeah i mean substitutionary in the sense  
[2:16:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8176) that uh christ takes on a punishment  
[2:16:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8179) um on behalf of the whole covenant on  
[2:16:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8181) behalf of the whole people so it's a  
[2:16:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8183) so basically i is an individual  
[2:16:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8186) um  
[2:16:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8187) yeah but i guess you should i guess you  
[2:16:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8189) should explain the difference between  
[2:16:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8192) governmental and penal substitution  
[2:16:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8194) because there's all right so government  
[2:16:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8196) difference yeah governmental views hold  
[2:16:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8198) that christ dies um for a collective or  
[2:16:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8202) for an institution or a nation because a  
[2:16:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8204) nation is more than just the sum total  
[2:16:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8206) of each individual member it's  
[2:16:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8208) considered to be its own sort of entity  
[2:16:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8211) god punishes entire nations for example  
[2:16:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8214) um so for ex so just as an instance when  
[2:16:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8217) god punished egypt it didn't mean  
[2:16:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8219) children or the innocent were spared or  
[2:17:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8222) when god punished evil people with noah  
[2:17:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8224) by sending the flood children were not  
[2:17:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8227) spared they were also taken up and  
[2:17:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8230) killed in that punishment for the sins  
[2:17:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8232) of their parents so  
[2:17:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8234) yeah but wouldn't the penal substitution  
[2:17:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8237) say the same thing i don't yeah yeah  
[2:17:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8241) yeah so the different right so the  
[2:17:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8242) difference is when god punishes a nation  
[2:17:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8244) he doesn't just punish the offenders the  
[2:17:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8246) people who committed the crimes he  
[2:17:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8248) punishes the entirety of the nation  
[2:17:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8251) whether it's the individuals or their  
[2:17:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8253) children or  
[2:17:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8254) even those who might not have committed  
[2:17:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8256) any crime themselves personally but have  
[2:17:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8258) just or would have just been among them  
[2:17:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8261) so  
[2:17:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8262) so that would be the main difference  
[2:17:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8264) there yeah i don't see the difference  
[2:17:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8266) because in penal substitution  
[2:17:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8269) the the underlying  
[2:17:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8271) a presupposition is that everyone has  
[2:17:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8273) sinned and fallen sure the glory of god  
[2:17:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8276) anyway so it's  
[2:17:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8277) it amounts to the same thing i don't  
[2:17:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8279) really see the difference the difference  
[2:18:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8281) is the effects are only given to people  
[2:18:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8283) who are a member of the nation  
[2:18:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8285) themselves if you don't have christ as  
[2:18:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8287) your king you do not get the benefits of  
[2:18:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8290) the sacrifice so for example i don't  
[2:18:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8293) understand how if penal substitution is  
[2:18:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8295) true  
[2:18:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8296) on that model why you know and christ  
[2:18:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8299) dies for the world  
[2:18:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8300) that everyone isn't just forgiven their  
[2:18:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8302) sense i understand it on this model  
[2:18:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8304) because it only extends to the covenant  
[2:18:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8306) those who are tied into his life death  
[2:18:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8309) and resurrection well it's conditional  
[2:18:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8311) upon the acceptance that's what most  
[2:18:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8313) people are going to say yeah it's  
[2:18:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8315) conditional upon the acceptance but the  
[2:18:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8316) acceptance brings you into the covenant  
[2:18:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8319) itself  
[2:18:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8320) so calvinist also bring up the issue of  
[2:18:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8322) if christ dies once for you and you  
[2:18:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8324) apostasize and you come back in it seems  
[2:18:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8326) like he has to die twice it's like a  
[2:18:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8328) sort of double jeopardy but my  
[2:18:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8330) understanding is christ only dies for  
[2:18:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8332) the church whether or not you are a  
[2:18:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8334) member of the church is a different  
[2:18:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8336) issue when we say christ dies for the  
[2:18:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8338) church we are saying that he's dying for  
[2:19:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8341) an institution or a covenant and whether  
[2:19:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8343) or not you are a member of it is tied  
[2:19:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8346) into whether or not you participate in  
[2:19:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8348) the rights of the church so  
[2:19:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8350) baptism  
[2:19:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8352) uh  
[2:19:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8353) so baptism confirmation um all the all  
[2:19:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8356) the sacraments  
[2:19:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8357) basically are ways of participating in  
[2:19:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8359) god's grace in this church  
[2:19:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8362) and you get those graces by  
[2:19:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8364) uh by first the baptism and then the  
[2:19:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8366) others usually tend to follow from there  
[2:19:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8368) and those sacraments bind you  
[2:19:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8370) to the life death and resurrection of  
[2:19:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8372) christ himself on the cross  
[2:19:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8374) and the reason why and the reason why  
[2:19:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8376) kings can often take the place of their  
[2:19:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8378) people  
[2:19:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8379) is because they're their head they're  
[2:19:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8382) their leader  
[2:19:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8383) and when they accept the office they  
[2:19:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8385) also accept those various  
[2:19:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8387) responsibilities punishments  
[2:19:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8390) and and so forth you're tied in very  
[2:19:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8392) heavily to the to the person otherwise  
[2:19:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8395) uh the monarchy just becomes a sort of  
[2:19:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8397) despotism and i don't really consider  
[2:20:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8400) and so that's the first thing the second  
[2:20:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8402) thing is often when god punishes nations  
[2:20:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8405) he doesn't just punish the people who do  
[2:20:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8407) who commit the crimes children are often  
[2:20:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8410) punished as well  
[2:20:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8411) um as well as others they're i don't  
[2:20:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8414) like not i'm not i mean we don't we  
[2:20:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8416) don't believe that in the sense that  
[2:20:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8417) like the children aren't being  
[2:20:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8419) punished in in that sense but i mean in  
[2:20:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8422) the flood of noah we're kill where there  
[2:20:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8424) are no children killed  
[2:20:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8425) but i mean i don't know but um  
[2:20:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8428) what no they think i think i think a  
[2:20:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8430) fair reading would say that even  
[2:20:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8432) children suffered no no what i'm saying  
[2:20:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8434) is i don't know to the specific question  
[2:20:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8435) i'm not saying that no no children i  
[2:20:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8437) mean so children die i i'm just saying  
[2:20:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8439) that i wouldn't see that as necessarily  
[2:20:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8442) a punishment for say yeah like like per  
[2:20:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8444) se like the like the the event itself  
[2:20:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8447) was a punishment however there could be  
[2:20:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8449) individuals who you know happen to be  
[2:20:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8452) uh uh you know victims of the same event  
[2:20:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8455) that aren't necessarily  
[2:20:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8457) punished by that in the sense that they  
[2:20:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8459) are liable for the crime  
[2:21:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8462) but uh  
[2:21:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8463) because everybody's gonna die anyway so  
[2:21:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8464) it could have been a flood  
[2:21:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8466) the person could have died like drowning  
[2:21:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8468) or something without it necessarily  
[2:21:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8470) being a punishment  
[2:21:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8472) so although  
[2:21:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8474) i'm just confused i don't i'm confused  
[2:21:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8476) by that response because i don't see how  
[2:21:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8478) uh two people can suffer from the same  
[2:21:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8481) thing namely a flood and it'd be a  
[2:21:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8483) punishment for one person and not be a  
[2:21:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8485) punishment for another person  
[2:21:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8487) well from the islamic paradigm that's  
[2:21:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8489) really works perfectly because the idea  
[2:21:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8491) i don't see it i don't i don't so so  
[2:21:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8493) both of you so let's let me  
[2:21:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8495) ground both of us can die drowning in  
[2:21:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8497) the sea right  
[2:21:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8499) right and and  
[2:21:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8500) one of it can be considered as  
[2:21:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8503) and in one instance it you you could  
[2:21:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8505) conceive of it being a punishment  
[2:21:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8507) from god  
[2:21:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8509) uh for something you did or whatever  
[2:21:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8510) right  
[2:21:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8511) i drowned in the same sea it's not  
[2:21:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8513) necessarily a punishment  
[2:21:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8514) that's the point so it's the same thing  
[2:21:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8516) it's it's like the same it's it's god's  
[2:21:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8519) creation and and it's god allowing both  
[2:22:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8521) things to happen i just don't see why it  
[2:22:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8523) has to be  
[2:22:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8525) the same like you have to attach to it  
[2:22:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8527) the same kind of like purpose it doesn't  
[2:22:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8529) have to be like that  
[2:22:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8530) so if i'm understanding this properly  
[2:22:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8535) a couple of things one  
[2:22:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8537) in the first instance if me and you are  
[2:22:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8539) out in sea and god destroys the boat as  
[2:22:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8541) punishment for sin  
[2:22:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8542) and he has the power to save me but  
[2:22:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8544) doesn't and i don't commit any sin of my  
[2:22:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8546) own but it still  
[2:22:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8548) warrants the taking of my own life  
[2:22:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8551) i think i'm the unfortunate victim here  
[2:22:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8554) rather than your life is going to be  
[2:22:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8556) taken anyway the point is that the point  
[2:22:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8558) for sin like everyone else that's how  
[2:22:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8559) original that's what that's that's the  
[2:22:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8561) presupposition that's your side that's  
[2:22:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8563) the pre-sale position you don't know  
[2:22:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8565) what i'm saying yeah it's a  
[2:22:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8566) presupposition i have to make sense of  
[2:22:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8569) it i don't understand how everyone's  
[2:22:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8570) life can be taken from them without sin  
[2:22:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8573) in islam because islam lacks original  
[2:22:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8575) sin so i'm not sure how you can so yeah  
[2:22:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8578) to say that you have to assume that  
[2:22:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8579) death is a punishment we don't we don't  
[2:23:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8582) see death as a punishment if it's not a  
[2:23:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8584) then i don't really understand how you  
[2:23:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8586) can give me that scenario where god  
[2:23:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8589) kills a guilty person  
[2:23:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8591) kills an innocent person it's a  
[2:23:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8592) punishment for the guilty person but not  
[2:23:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8594) a punishment for an innocent so okay so  
[2:23:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8597) okay okay so so let's let's so for  
[2:23:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8599) example in islam there's there's uh  
[2:23:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8601) there's the idea of a kaffara or  
[2:23:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8603) something that's like a penance for that  
[2:23:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8605) your your um  
[2:23:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8608) something that elevates the muslim like  
[2:23:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8610) a a let's say an illness you go through  
[2:23:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8612) that elevates you in ranks right  
[2:23:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8615) we wouldn't say that's a punishment per  
[2:23:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8617) say it's it has a purpose and you you  
[2:23:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8620) through  
[2:23:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8621) patience and perseverance and stuff like  
[2:23:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8623) that you pat pass the test and it  
[2:23:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8625) elevates you in ranks well but that same  
[2:23:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8627) illness to a wicked person  
[2:23:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8630) can be a punishment i mean what's it's  
[2:23:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8632) the same it's the same thing but you can  
[2:23:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8634) conceive of them  
[2:23:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8636) having different purposes i don't see  
[2:23:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8637) what's wrong with that  
[2:23:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8639) okay so  
[2:24:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8641) so it's like a pandemic like a pandemic  
[2:24:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8644) a pandemic is going to affect good and  
[2:24:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8646) bad people  
[2:24:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8647) but we would say for the good person  
[2:24:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8650) it affects it affects him in a way which  
[2:24:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8652) wipes away his sins  
[2:24:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8654) raises his rank he demonstrates the  
[2:24:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8657) courage and the patience and  
[2:24:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8659) perseverance so he shows them soul  
[2:24:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8661) building characteristics but for the bad  
[2:24:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8663) person it's a punishment  
[2:24:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8665) yeah what what okay but what soul  
[2:24:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8667) building characteristics can you give to  
[2:24:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8669) an infant who dies  
[2:24:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8672) there is no soul building no that's not  
[2:24:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8674) yeah but  
[2:24:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8675) i think you're no  
[2:24:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8676) challenge back into the  
[2:24:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8678) analogy  
[2:24:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8680) and even and also to the drowning  
[2:24:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8682) analogy because because no no no so let  
[2:24:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8684) me give you  
[2:24:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8686) what i was saying was that death john  
[2:24:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8688) death  
[2:24:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8689) we were not assuming death is a  
[2:24:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8690) punishment and i was just giving you and  
[2:24:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8691) you're saying well how can this one  
[2:24:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8693) event  
[2:24:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8694) that you call a punishment  
[2:24:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8696) uh you know  
[2:24:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8698) cause the death of of of certain people  
[2:25:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8701) without it being a punishment for them  
[2:25:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8702) and i was just and so what i'm doing is  
[2:25:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8704) i'm giving you an analogy to show you  
[2:25:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8706) that  
[2:25:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8707) the same thing can be used for two  
[2:25:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8709) different purposes in a similar way  
[2:25:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8711) death so so so when when when the people  
[2:25:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8714) when the people who  
[2:25:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8716) a lot of those uh people the past who  
[2:25:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8718) sinned and they were destroyed or  
[2:25:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8719) whatever  
[2:25:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8720) if they didn't sin it's not like they  
[2:25:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8721) weren't gonna die that's not that's not  
[2:25:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8723) an islamic point of view the point isn't  
[2:25:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8724) that oh you sinned therefore you're  
[2:25:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8726) gonna die it's like  
[2:25:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8728) the way you die and what's waiting for  
[2:25:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8730) you after death i mean uh the the the  
[2:25:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8733) point here is that what  
[2:25:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8736) what you want to say is that well the  
[2:25:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8738) concept of death in and of itself  
[2:25:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8742) is  
[2:25:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8742) uh  
[2:25:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8743) you know can only be made sense of in  
[2:25:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8745) light of it being a punishment i don't i  
[2:25:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8748) don't see why that has to be the case  
[2:25:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8750) so you're just we're just moving from  
[2:25:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8752) one world to another yeah it's like  
[2:25:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8754) somebody who's who's martyred it's not  
[2:25:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8756) well i wouldn't say it as a punishment  
[2:25:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8759) i mean i mean if i kill your child it's  
[2:26:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8761) and i tell you well he's just going from  
[2:26:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8763) one world to another i think you would  
[2:26:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8766) take a lot of umbrage with that sort of  
[2:26:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8767) perspective like death has this very  
[2:26:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8770) heaviest thing it's called the last of  
[2:26:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8771) the enemies for a reason in our religion  
[2:26:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8773) but even  
[2:26:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8774) so you equate you equate the murdering  
[2:26:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8777) of a child with god causing the death of  
[2:26:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8779) children that's the so that you see  
[2:26:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8781) those two is the same thing  
[2:26:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8782) what i'm saying is death isn't something  
[2:26:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8784) to take lightly that i'm not taking it  
[2:26:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8786) lightly i'm just i'm just saying you  
[2:26:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8788) guys were sorry  
[2:26:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8789) no so so so so somebody murdering a baby  
[2:26:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8793) versus god causing the death of a baby  
[2:26:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8796) do you see those two as the same thing  
[2:26:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8798) because clearly if someone kills my  
[2:26:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8800) child  
[2:26:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8801) yeah but then but then do i see god  
[2:26:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8803) taking the life of a child in the same  
[2:26:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8805) way i see a person killing a child  
[2:26:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8808) god has a right to take away from my  
[2:26:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8810) perspective or paradigm and i know that  
[2:26:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8812) word period i'm shifting i get it but on  
[2:26:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8815) my paradigm god has a right to take the  
[2:26:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8817) life of everyone because it is  
[2:26:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8819) precisely a punishment but i don't  
[2:27:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8821) understand what it is precisely because  
[2:27:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8823) it's what sorry i didn't it's considered  
[2:27:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8824) a punishment  
[2:27:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8825) precisely death is considered a  
[2:27:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8827) punishment visited upon humanity so  
[2:27:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8830) so  
[2:27:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8831) if humanity was sinless hold on i i  
[2:27:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8834) understand god taking away having the  
[2:27:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8836) power to take away human life on that  
[2:27:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8838) regard regardless of the age  
[2:27:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8840) but not but any individual person  
[2:27:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8842) doesn't have that right to take away the  
[2:27:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8844) life of my child because that is not a  
[2:27:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8847) his life  
[2:27:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8848) and b that is also and b he my child has  
[2:27:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8851) done nothing as a transgression against  
[2:27:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8854) any other person  
[2:27:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8855) um  
[2:27:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8856) and not and thus they don't have that  
[2:27:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8858) right okay so if humanity if humanity  
[2:27:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8860) was sinless god wouldn't have the right  
[2:27:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8864) to take away anybody's life  
[2:27:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8866) no  
[2:27:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8867) death would not even be in the world if  
[2:27:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8869) human beings didn't send it just  
[2:27:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8870) wouldn't exist no no  
[2:27:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8872) no it's not my question my question is  
[2:27:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8874) assume a state of affairs where humanity  
[2:27:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8876) is sinless or only angels existed would  
[2:27:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8879) god have the right to take away their  
[2:28:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8881) lives  
[2:28:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8882) uh would god have the right to take oh  
[2:28:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8884) but god have a right to take away the  
[2:28:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8885) life of like an angel or yeah yeah or a  
[2:28:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8888) soul uh no because existence is no i  
[2:28:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8892) would say not existence so god cannot  
[2:28:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8895) kill angels god can does not have the  
[2:28:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8897) right to  
[2:28:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8898) you know just  
[2:28:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8899) you know  
[2:28:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8900) just eliminate the existence of angels i  
[2:28:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8903) mean why doesn't he just eliminate the  
[2:28:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8904) existence of satan or any other evil i'm  
[2:28:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8906) asking why he wouldn't asking whether  
[2:28:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8908) you think he has the right too  
[2:28:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8911) hold on let me just explain well the  
[2:28:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8913) reason i bring up that um the reason i  
[2:28:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8916) bring that up as just one example is it  
[2:28:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8919) is on my understanding it makes sense  
[2:28:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8921) why god wouldn't take away the life or  
[2:28:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8923) even why he wouldn't just annihilate  
[2:28:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8925) souls in hell it's because every soul  
[2:28:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8928) that exists  
[2:28:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8930) is  
[2:28:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8931) at base existent and existence and  
[2:28:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8934) goodness and truth are all what are  
[2:28:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8937) called transcendentals and all of those  
[2:28:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8939) things are considered to be goods onto  
[2:29:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8942) themselves and god doesn't create things  
[2:29:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8945) without a purpose everything that god  
[2:29:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8947) brings into existence god sustains and  
[2:29:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8949) maintains in existence and that includes  
[2:29:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8952) angels and human souls and anything else  
[2:29:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8956) which is essentially immortal and  
[2:29:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8958) because that's the question  
[2:29:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8959) you're just saying that it doesn't  
[2:29:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8963) you're just saying that doesn't exist  
[2:29:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8964) because you're saying that so the souls  
[2:29:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8966) that are in hell for example you can't  
[2:29:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8968) you're not going to kill them but  
[2:29:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8969) they're sinful  
[2:29:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8971) yeah he punishes them forever  
[2:29:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8973) yes and so death is irrelevant here and  
[2:29:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8976) and persons are and persons are still  
[2:29:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8979) death is irrelevant  
[2:29:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8982) no because the law okay but then you see  
[2:29:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8984) that you see that  
[2:29:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8986) you see that an implication or a  
[2:29:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8988) consequence of your position is that god  
[2:29:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8990) literally cannot take away the life of  
[2:29:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8992) angels he can't do that he's he cannot  
[2:29:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8995) right he brings them into existence  
[2:29:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8998) he cannot take  
[2:29:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=8999) okay so once god brings creatures into  
[2:30:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9002) existence he cannot take them out of  
[2:30:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9004) existence yeah just like he can violate  
[2:30:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9006) the laws of logic or  
[2:30:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9010) there's no contradiction  
[2:30:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9012) there's no contradiction with like  
[2:30:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9015) no no there's no contradiction there's  
[2:30:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9017) no con yeah so what you want to say is  
[2:30:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9019) it's metaphysically impossible because  
[2:30:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9020) it contradicts his nature so what you  
[2:30:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9022) want to say is that god taking something  
[2:30:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9025) out of it taking an agent out of  
[2:30:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9026) existence  
[2:30:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9028) is immoral  
[2:30:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9029) some taking something which is  
[2:30:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9030) essentially immortal out of existence is  
[2:30:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9033) immoral  
[2:30:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9034) yes why why  
[2:30:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9036) he created it  
[2:30:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9038) it's his  
[2:30:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9039) it's quite simple it's because it's  
[2:30:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9041) because existence is considered to be  
[2:30:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9043) one of the three transcendentals along  
[2:30:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9045) with goodness and truth and for god to  
[2:30:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9047) eliminate something  
[2:30:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9049) like a soul or an angel which is  
[2:30:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9052) essentially existent is the same thing  
[2:30:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9054) as him eliminating something which is  
[2:30:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9056) which is good or which has or which is  
[2:30:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9059) true it's just something that god does  
[2:31:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9061) not do at that level uh  
[2:31:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9063) something which is considered form is by  
[2:31:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9066) nature  
[2:31:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9067) immortal and by and god doesn't violate  
[2:31:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9070) something's essence like that  
[2:31:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9072) okay so i mean so you're just adding  
[2:31:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9074) layers to the theory that just making it  
[2:31:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9075) seem much much more implausible but then  
[2:31:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9078) so what so what you're saying is that  
[2:31:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9080) you know the the the these these uh  
[2:31:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9083) these souls or or or whatever it is you  
[2:31:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9086) want to call it are uh by nature okay  
[2:31:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9091) could  
[2:31:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9091) so just to ask you a question to maybe  
[2:31:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9093) elucidate this could god tell you a lie  
[2:31:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9096) no i'm not saying could god let you fall  
[2:31:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9098) under deception can god tell you a lie  
[2:31:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9100) no no no okay yeah and is there a  
[2:31:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9102) contradiction with someone telling you a  
[2:31:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9104) lie  
[2:31:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9105) no but you see i already see i already  
[2:31:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9106) granted that i already said you don't  
[2:31:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9107) have to give me a contradiction but it  
[2:31:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9109) just seems very counterintuitive what  
[2:31:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9111) you're saying is that well telling a lie  
[2:31:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9113) clearly that seems immoral right but  
[2:31:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9115) what you're saying is that god  
[2:31:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9118) cannot take a being that he brought into  
[2:32:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9120) existence out of existence a being that  
[2:32:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9122) he owns  
[2:32:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9123) i'm not telling you torturing him for no  
[2:32:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9125) reason or whatever i'm just saying  
[2:32:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9126) taking a being that he brought into  
[2:32:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9128) existence out of existence on your view  
[2:32:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9130) that's immoral  
[2:32:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9131) i don't see that all the time  
[2:32:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9133) in the same way i see a lie  
[2:32:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9135) because it's absurd  
[2:32:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9137) just sorry really quickly john i just  
[2:32:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9139) want to understand you're saying that  
[2:32:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9140) anything that god creates  
[2:32:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9142) he cannot remove from existence and he  
[2:32:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9144) can't like let's say say conscious be  
[2:32:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9146) like like i'll say i saw i said an angel  
[2:32:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9147) so a sinless  
[2:32:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9149) is it just a conscious being john  
[2:32:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9152) because you're you said that existence  
[2:32:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9154) is one of the transcendental positions  
[2:32:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9156) so that's what i'm trying to understand  
[2:32:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9163) so what does god make in his image he  
[2:32:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9165) makes in genesis men in his image and he  
[2:32:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9168) makes angels in his image let us make  
[2:32:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9170) man into our own image that's what  
[2:32:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9172) revelation tells us is in his image and  
[2:32:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9174) for god to destroy something in his own  
[2:32:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9176) image would be  
[2:32:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9178) um in essence to go against who he is  
[2:33:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9181) what is that has a reflection you don't  
[2:33:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9183) mind explaining what is what does it  
[2:33:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9185) mean will you understand it oh it means  
[2:33:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9188) base so the rational soul of a man and  
[2:33:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9191) of angels is considered to be a  
[2:33:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9192) reflection of god himself which it who  
[2:33:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9196) himself is basically the source of all  
[2:33:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9199) reason truth etc  
[2:33:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9201) so basically our ability to reason about  
[2:33:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9203) the world to  
[2:33:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9205) uh have knowledge of things anything  
[2:33:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9207) like particulars or universals that's  
[2:33:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9209) something only angels and human beings  
[2:33:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9211) have not any lower animals and hence for  
[2:33:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9214) god to destroy that would be essentially  
[2:33:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9216) or bring it totally out of existence  
[2:33:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9218) would hence be to attack his own very  
[2:33:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9222) image so he doesn't do that that's why i  
[2:33:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9225) how is it attacking his image he can  
[2:33:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9226) just create new images  
[2:33:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9228) i mean  
[2:33:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9229) you see  
[2:33:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9230) his images  
[2:33:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9231) is eternal immortal it's something no no  
[2:33:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9234) yeah i get that  
[2:33:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9235) creation no no i'm talking about the  
[2:33:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9237) creation the reflection so you're saying  
[2:33:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9239) the reflections of his image so he  
[2:34:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9241) cannot take it out of existence well he  
[2:34:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9242) well it didn't exist before he brought  
[2:34:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9244) into existence so well then  
[2:34:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9246) that that's not a a perfect mirror of  
[2:34:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9249) his image because he was never out of  
[2:34:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9250) existence these mirrors were out of  
[2:34:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9252) existence so he could just bring new uh  
[2:34:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9255) creations into existence that mirror his  
[2:34:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9257) qualities i just don't see  
[2:34:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9259) it's just presupposition after  
[2:34:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9261) presupposition  
[2:34:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9264) forgive me because i think we're going  
[2:34:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9265) slightly off topic um on this particular  
[2:34:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9268) issue yeah we've gone way  
[2:34:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9270) out of the  
[2:34:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9272) what the topic is right yeah if we can  
[2:34:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9274) sort of reel it back into the original  
[2:34:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9276) yeah i'm still confused about how  
[2:34:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9279) governmental theory as you're  
[2:34:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9282) uh conceiving it is distinguished  
[2:34:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9284) between substitutionary atonement i  
[2:34:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9288) from my reading i just want to read you  
[2:34:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9290) something here  
[2:34:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9291) uh this is just on wikipedia to see if  
[2:34:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9294) you agree with it or not it says  
[2:34:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9296) governmental theory cannot incorporate  
[2:34:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9298) into itself  
[2:35:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9300) the main elements of two major theories  
[2:35:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9302) a satisfaction theory of atonement and a  
[2:35:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9305) penal substitutionary theory of  
[2:35:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9307) atonement however  
[2:35:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9309) it can incorporate different  
[2:35:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9310) understandings promoted in the other two  
[2:35:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9313) atonement theories  
[2:35:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9314) it incorporates notably  
[2:35:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9318) peter forsythes i'm not sure if i'm  
[2:35:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9321) pronouncing it maybe  
[2:35:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9323) not sure uh anyway his emphasis on how  
[2:35:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9327) the holiness of god figures in the  
[2:35:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9329) atonement  
[2:35:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9330) it incorporates uh em it incorporates an  
[2:35:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9334) emphasis on christ ransoming humans as  
[2:35:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9337) the classical ransom theory  
[2:35:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9340) of atonement it incorporates the  
[2:35:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9342) emphasis on god's love which is the main  
[2:35:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9344) point  
[2:35:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9345) uh and going on and on here then it says  
[2:35:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9347) the governmental view is similar to the  
[2:35:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9350) satisfaction view  
[2:35:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9351) and the penal substitution view in that  
[2:35:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9354) all three views see christ as satisfying  
[2:35:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9357) god's requirement for the punishment of  
[2:35:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9359) sin however  
[2:36:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9361) the governmental view disagrees with the  
[2:36:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9364) other two in that it does not affirm  
[2:36:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9366) that christ endured the precise  
[2:36:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9369) punishment that sin deserves or paid its  
[2:36:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9372) actual  
[2:36:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9374) or paid its sacrificial equivalent  
[2:36:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9376) instead christ's suffering was simply an  
[2:36:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9379) alternative to that punishment do you  
[2:36:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9381) agree with that i agree it was an  
[2:36:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9383) alternative to the punishment because  
[2:36:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9385) the punishment of your king or monarch  
[2:36:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9388) is a different  
[2:36:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9389) sort of punishment than the punishment  
[2:36:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9391) you yourself would undertake in hell  
[2:36:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9394) yeah but the difference is that your  
[2:36:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9397) punishment in hell is quantitative in  
[2:36:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9400) that it is eternal and ongoing and  
[2:36:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9402) without end whereas because of christ's  
[2:36:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9406) qualitative nature as being both god and  
[2:36:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9409) man and as being sinless  
[2:36:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9411) it was and of course being our perfect  
[2:36:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9414) head of government it is  
[2:36:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9416) a different sort of punishment  
[2:36:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9417) altogether  
[2:36:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9419) yeah but then it also says here in  
[2:37:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9421) contrast penal substitution holds that  
[2:37:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9423) christ endured the exact punishment or  
[2:37:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9426) the exact worth of of punishment that  
[2:37:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9429) sin deserved  
[2:37:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9431) so do you think that the exact the  
[2:37:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9433) punishment  
[2:37:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9434) on your view that christ  
[2:37:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9437) endured was worth the punishment of our  
[2:37:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9441) all of our sins  
[2:37:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9442) yeah i would say so i don't think that  
[2:37:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9444) female substitution is is actually yeah  
[2:37:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9446) i don't think penal substitution is  
[2:37:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9449) fully um  
[2:37:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9450) separate from the moral government's  
[2:37:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9452) angle my only point was it's stressful  
[2:37:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9454) well then that's what i'm saying and you  
[2:37:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9455) don't agree with the characterization of  
[2:37:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9457) this i know it's only wikipedia but  
[2:37:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9459) right i'm really struggling to see what  
[2:37:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9461) the difference is maybe it's just my  
[2:37:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9464) inadequacy i think the main difference  
[2:37:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9467) here is it's done well at least the main  
[2:37:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9469) difference here and why i characterize  
[2:37:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9470) it as a moral governance view is because  
[2:37:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9472) it stems from god as moral governor of  
[2:37:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9474) the universe and from his place as being  
[2:37:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9477) the head of the church and hence uh our  
[2:37:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9479) king or prince it stems from yeah but  
[2:38:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9481) substitutionary atonement uh proponents  
[2:38:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9484) would agree with all of that it just  
[2:38:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9485) seems like you're just emphasizing  
[2:38:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9489) different language but they would be on  
[2:38:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9491) board with that language anyway so  
[2:38:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9494) i mean if they're on board they're on  
[2:38:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9495) board but i think this is more of an  
[2:38:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9497) argument of testimony than whether or  
[2:38:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9498) not it holds true oh i'm not arguing  
[2:38:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9501) whether i hold true i'm just i'm still  
[2:38:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9503) trying to understand what it even means  
[2:38:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9506) okay  
[2:38:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9507) it basically means in distinction  
[2:38:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9509) between that this and the penal  
[2:38:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9511) substitution view i'm not worried about  
[2:38:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9513) it  
[2:38:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9514) i don't understand it so penal  
[2:38:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9515) substitutionary atonement theorists  
[2:38:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9517) would probably want to more argue  
[2:38:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9520) that a it was necessary  
[2:38:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9522) and b it was something which is rooted  
[2:38:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9525) in the sacrificial system of the old  
[2:38:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9526) covenant  
[2:38:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9527) my argument is it's more so rooted in  
[2:38:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9530) his status as the head of our covenant  
[2:38:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9532) and our church and b it wasn't strictly  
[2:38:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9535) necessary but it was  
[2:38:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9537) but it was um something god instituted  
[2:39:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9540) because it was fitting and because it  
[2:39:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9541) was worthwhile to go through and  
[2:39:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9544) worthwhile for a punishment for the  
[2:39:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9546) church to undertake before coming into  
[2:39:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9549) um god's mercy and of and  
[2:39:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9552) our repentance that's the main  
[2:39:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9554) difference if it's one of emphasis it's  
[2:39:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9556) one of emphasis and if you want to say  
[2:39:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9557) it's penal substitutionary then it's  
[2:39:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9559) penal substitutionary but that's not i'm  
[2:39:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9562) not really here  
[2:39:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9564) or i'm not really too concerned with the  
[2:39:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9565) taximoney of it  
[2:39:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9568) yeah i am only because i'm more  
[2:39:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9571) uh familiar with penal substitutionary  
[2:39:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9573) atonement and  
[2:39:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9574) if i don't know the relevant difference  
[2:39:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9577) then it's i'm not going to be able to  
[2:39:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9579) really offer a meaningful criticism  
[2:39:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9582) okay so  
[2:39:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9584) it so i mean it's fine all right i was  
[2:39:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9586) just getting critiquing the general idea  
[2:39:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9588) of substitutionary rights so do you  
[2:39:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9590) think any of your critiques of  
[2:39:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9592) substitution of substitutionary  
[2:39:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9593) atonement would hold up  
[2:39:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9596) yeah the same idea that i've been saying  
[2:39:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9598) the whole entire time that an innocent  
[2:40:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9600) person  
[2:40:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9601) dying for the sins of all the guilty to  
[2:40:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9603) me isn't unjust  
[2:40:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9605) is it all right how's  
[2:40:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9607) all right so a couple of things one  
[2:40:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9610) so i guess i would just want to go  
[2:40:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9613) and this is where the whole flood of  
[2:40:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9614) noah came in it's because we know that  
[2:40:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9616) there are instances where innocent  
[2:40:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9618) people die out of the fact that god  
[2:40:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9620) gives retribution to entire nations we  
[2:40:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9623) know that's the case in the old  
[2:40:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9624) testament we know it's the case  
[2:40:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9627) at least that's how it comes across in  
[2:40:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9628) some narratives that the quran takes up  
[2:40:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9631) from the bible  
[2:40:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9632) i just don't understand what it means to  
[2:40:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9634) say that oh yeah you know they were just  
[2:40:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9636) caught in the crossfire despite the fact  
[2:40:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9638) that god is powerful enough to let  
[2:40:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9640) innocent people go  
[2:40:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9642) but i don't understand why god can't  
[2:40:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9644) allow an innocent person to suffer  
[2:40:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9646) because of the evils of the guilty  
[2:40:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9649) that i don't understand how that can  
[2:40:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9651) follow i also he can i can he can he can  
[2:40:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9655) allow that to happen as clearly you're  
[2:40:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9656) saying it does uh in natural disasters  
[2:40:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9659) or what you're talking about with noah  
[2:41:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9661) but those people that are dying those  
[2:41:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9664) innocent people that are dying like the  
[2:41:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9666) baby the equivalent in that situation  
[2:41:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9668) would be that the baby dying because  
[2:41:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9670) he's innocent therefore somehow  
[2:41:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9674) it accounts for those evil parents that  
[2:41:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9676) he had and the sins that they did that's  
[2:41:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9679) the equivalent in the story which is not  
[2:41:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9681) present in any islamic story or the  
[2:41:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9683) flood of noah or anything else you can  
[2:41:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9685) bring up yeah i mean it works on the  
[2:41:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9686) christian paradigm because again all are  
[2:41:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9688) guilty and all suffer death as a  
[2:41:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9690) consequence of the mistakes of our  
[2:41:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9692) parents but again this is why it doesn't  
[2:41:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9695) really make sense to me on the islamic  
[2:41:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9697) paradigm because death seems really bad  
[2:41:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9700) no matter who you ask no matter how you  
[2:41:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9702) characterize it it's something that  
[2:41:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9705) when a child undergoes it despite their  
[2:41:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9707) pure innocence i don't understand why  
[2:41:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9710) what benefit could have to anybody there  
[2:41:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9713) i like it just doesn't really work out  
[2:41:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9716) for me i yeah real quick i don't i don't  
[2:41:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9718) want to go off on another tangent i just  
[2:41:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9719) want to say real quick the the problem  
[2:42:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9721) is because i think you're you're a  
[2:42:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9722) rationale for why you know god can't  
[2:42:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9724) like  
[2:42:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9725) uh kill or or or  
[2:42:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9728) remove the existence of  
[2:42:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9729) something that is sinless or something  
[2:42:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9731) that he created in his image  
[2:42:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9734) it almost seems like what you're saying  
[2:42:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9735) is that well it can't vanish out of  
[2:42:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9737) existence but that doesn't seem to be  
[2:42:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9739) what death is so so so think of it think  
[2:42:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9742) of a sinless human right  
[2:42:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9745) and their soul  
[2:42:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9746) just moving from this life to the next  
[2:42:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9748) given the rationale you're providing in  
[2:42:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9750) the fact that they're created in god's  
[2:42:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9752) image and they can't just cease to exist  
[2:42:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9754) they haven't ceased to exist they just  
[2:42:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9755) have moved on it looks bad for us  
[2:42:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9758) they're dying death seems bad how do you  
[2:42:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9761) know it's bad for actually like as a  
[2:42:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9763) theist i don't think you should like  
[2:42:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9765) just as a theist without your christian  
[2:42:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9767) uh  
[2:42:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9768) presuppositions coming coming into the  
[2:42:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9770) picture i don't see how why you should  
[2:42:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9772) see death as as necessarily bad just  
[2:42:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9776) depends on where you're going but it's  
[2:42:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9777) just moving from one place to another so  
[2:43:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9780) you don't cease to exist so the whole  
[2:43:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9782) rational ground you have for god not  
[2:43:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9785) being able to  
[2:43:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9787) take something out of existence that is  
[2:43:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9788) in his image is even preserved on the  
[2:43:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9791) muslim conception because he just moved  
[2:43:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9793) from one realm to another you're not  
[2:43:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9795) yeah i mean  
[2:43:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9797) but i don't know i think muslims hold to  
[2:43:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9799) that like i know you're confessing to  
[2:43:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9801) that but i've  
[2:43:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9802) i've experienced people losing their  
[2:43:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9804) children to natural disasters and  
[2:43:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9807) diseases they are  
[2:43:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9809) they are people who really bemoan the  
[2:43:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9811) loss of their children they don't just  
[2:43:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9812) see it as their kid teleporting from one  
[2:43:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9814) place to another they cry they wail they  
[2:43:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9817) take days to recover  
[2:43:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9819) it's a pretty hard channel  
[2:43:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9822) nobody's denying that but what about  
[2:43:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9824) people who actually want to die like  
[2:43:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9826) christian martyrs  
[2:43:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9828) what about them they're you're saying  
[2:43:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9830) that it's a bad thing well if it's so  
[2:43:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9832) bad why are there people who throughout  
[2:43:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9835) church history actually wanted to die  
[2:43:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9837) and be a martyr  
[2:43:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9839) the reason  
[2:44:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9840) no the reason martyrship is done is as  
[2:44:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9842) you said earlier it's a form of soul  
[2:44:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9844) building it's also a way of testifying  
[2:44:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9846) to the truth of the religion  
[2:44:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9848) and of itself is not bad  
[2:44:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9850) so can i real quickly therefore  
[2:44:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9855) you hear me  
[2:44:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9856) oh i hear you i just want to just make a  
[2:44:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9857) quick point before i wanted to real  
[2:44:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9859) quickly because you you with the islamic  
[2:44:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9861) and christian paradigms there's two  
[2:44:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9863) things i want to bring up one it said it  
[2:44:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9864) is not the christian paradigm you're a  
[2:44:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9866) catholic i assume by the iconic tree  
[2:44:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9869) around you but uh the orthodox would  
[2:44:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9871) disagree with you um about the original  
[2:44:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9874) sin second  
[2:44:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9875) about the  
[2:44:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9876) paradigm second about the islamic  
[2:44:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9878) paradigm  
[2:44:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9880) that's you're speaking about it  
[2:44:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9883) it's very clear that death is a creation  
[2:44:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9886) and  
[2:44:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9888) you know the one who created death death  
[2:44:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9890) is a creation it's  
[2:44:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9892) not non-existence so you are  
[2:44:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9894) misrepresenting  
[2:44:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9896) islam in that vein too i'm just going to  
[2:44:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9898) throw that out there there are other  
[2:44:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9899) things that i could pull out where you  
[2:45:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9901) were you know kind of uh shaky on your  
[2:45:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9904) logic and you're inconsistent but that's  
[2:45:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9906) for another time  
[2:45:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9907) okay a couple things one most of the uh  
[2:45:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9910) most of the attempts by most modern  
[2:45:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9912) orthodox about original sin  
[2:45:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9914) that comes from terrible 18th 19th  
[2:45:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9916) century russian orthodox theology  
[2:45:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9919) it's not actually what you find when you  
[2:45:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9921) look at much older stuff secondly um  
[2:45:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9924) most of the stuff i'm just regaling here  
[2:45:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9926) is from is what i'm hearing i just don't  
[2:45:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9928) think it really works out with how human  
[2:45:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9929) beings understand it in terms of their  
[2:45:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9931) own psychology third of all relating to  
[2:45:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9933) the martyrs yeah sometimes yeah  
[2:45:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9935) christians are called to undergo evils  
[2:45:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9937) for the sake of bringing about some  
[2:45:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9939) greater good like the testimony of the  
[2:45:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9941) church for example  
[2:45:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9943) that i have no problem  
[2:45:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9945) in understanding what i do have a  
[2:45:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9946) problem in understanding is why someone  
[2:45:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9949) who is completely innocent does not sin  
[2:45:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9952) at all  
[2:45:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9953) why would god just want to take their  
[2:45:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9955) life  
[2:45:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9956) in and of itself when he is powerful  
[2:45:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9958) enough to prevent it and when they you  
[2:46:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9960) know commit no sins against anyone else  
[2:46:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9963) i understand that so afghanistan  
[2:46:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9966) is that mentioned  
[2:46:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9968) i understand that in terms of  
[2:46:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9969) christianity because i understand so let  
[2:46:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9971) me that element yeah  
[2:46:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9973) so john let me let you know but the  
[2:46:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9975) difference is  
[2:46:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9976) the difference between that hold on the  
[2:46:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9978) difference between that the fundamental  
[2:46:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9980) difference between that and the theory  
[2:46:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9982) that you're proposing  
[2:46:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9984) is that the death of the innocent person  
[2:46:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9987) is somehow  
[2:46:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9988) accounting for the sins of the other  
[2:46:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9991) people in an eternal state  
[2:46:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9994) it has nothing to do you're talking  
[2:46:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9996) about oh somebody being an innocent  
[2:46:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=9998) bystander that died in a hurricane  
[2:46:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10000) because these other people were were  
[2:46:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10002) killing their children or doing bad  
[2:46:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10005) things that's not the same as an  
[2:46:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10007) innocent person dying in order to  
[2:46:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10010) restore that person  
[2:46:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10012) in right standing with god for eternity  
[2:46:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10015) those are two totally different things  
[2:46:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10018) yeah  
[2:46:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10019) the yeah yeah i agree they are two  
[2:47:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10021) different things the difference between  
[2:47:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10022) jesus christ is when he takes his place  
[2:47:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10025) as the head of our church and our  
[2:47:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10026) monarch that's a very intimate role  
[2:47:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10028) similar to a husband or a wife if if i  
[2:47:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10031) get married and she has a substantive  
[2:47:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10033) amount of debt i can pay it back i can  
[2:47:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10036) take it on to myself i could even help  
[2:47:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10038) her deal with that because  
[2:47:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10040) we have a closer bond and there's  
[2:47:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10042) considered some sort of and we  
[2:47:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10044) understand by virtue of law  
[2:47:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10046) that two people can share it likewise i  
[2:47:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10049) don't understand why a king couldn't  
[2:47:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10051) take on a role where he knows that a  
[2:47:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10054) certain people are responsible for a sin  
[2:47:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10056) or sins on a national level and in  
[2:47:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10059) voluntarily taking on that position or  
[2:47:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10061) that office he has to  
[2:47:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10064) pay back the debt of the entire nation  
[2:47:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10066) if jesus christ wants to he can become  
[2:47:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10069) incarnate take on that role and pay it  
[2:47:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10072) back there the difference at least on  
[2:47:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10074) paid to him  
[2:47:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10076) himself  
[2:47:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10077) yeah i mean so oh that's oh are you  
[2:47:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10079) doing that whole oh god kills himself to  
[2:48:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10082) pay back himself well he's paying  
[2:48:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10084) himself unless you want to say he's  
[2:48:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10085) paying the devil oh simple there are two  
[2:48:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10087) oh there are two offices god takes on  
[2:48:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10089) has the office by nature moral governor  
[2:48:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10091) of the universe but he also takes on a  
[2:48:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10093) secondary or additional office as being  
[2:48:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10095) the head of the church uh in the same  
[2:48:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10097) way you can in the same way we also have  
[2:48:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10100) the nation of canada which has a  
[2:48:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10102) specific debt to great britain but the  
[2:48:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10104) head of state there the one in canada  
[2:48:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10106) who pays back the debt to the head of  
[2:48:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10108) state in great britain is the queen of  
[2:48:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10110) canada paying back the debt to the queen  
[2:48:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10112) of great britain it  
[2:48:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10114) in legal matters this can happen god can  
[2:48:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10116) take on two offices bear two  
[2:48:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10118) responsibilities and those  
[2:48:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10119) responsibilities can be shared between  
[2:48:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10121) the two offices i really have no issue  
[2:48:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10123) with yeah to me it does make what you  
[2:48:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10126) just said is not analogous to god paying  
[2:48:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10129) the debt to himself it's not the same  
[2:48:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10131) thing i mean how to stay paying  
[2:48:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10133) questions in virtue of two distinct  
[2:48:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10135) offices i don't see an issue no john  
[2:48:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10137) fisher hold on hold on john fisher  
[2:48:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10139) canada although it may be part of  
[2:49:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10141) quote-unquote the commonwealth yeah and  
[2:49:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10144) it has a  
[2:49:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10145) uh how do you say a symbolic head being  
[2:49:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10148) the uh the queen yeah of england yeah or  
[2:49:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10151) queen of he's the head of state  
[2:49:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10153) yeah symbolic head we know canada we  
[2:49:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10157) know canada is in origin a separate  
[2:49:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10160) state with a separate set of laws a  
[2:49:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10162) separate set of legislators yeah and in  
[2:49:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10165) reality canada and britain operate as  
[2:49:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10168) two separate states  
[2:49:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10170) yeah they don't operate as though  
[2:49:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10171) they're one state  
[2:49:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10173) you know  
[2:49:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10174) the analogy would be the analogy would  
[2:49:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10176) be is i owe a debt to myself so i  
[2:49:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10179) decided to take that payment and pay  
[2:49:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10182) myself as though i paid and as i  
[2:49:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10184) fulfilled a debt that's that's that's  
[2:49:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10187) it's not an alligator the analogy is not  
[2:49:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10189) canada and britain  
[2:49:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10191) yeah and the fact that they share a head  
[2:49:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10192) of state called the queen yeah as though  
[2:49:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10195) the queen  
[2:49:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10196) and canada and britain are actually one  
[2:49:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10198) nation really they're not one nation  
[2:50:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10200) that's not how it works that's that is  
[2:50:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10203) virtually what my argument my analogy  
[2:50:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10205) relies on the fact that they are not one  
[2:50:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10207) nation just like how  
[2:50:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10209) the church is not the same thing as god  
[2:50:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10211) so it's not canada it's not the same  
[2:50:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10214) itself  
[2:50:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10215) yeah it's not the head of  
[2:50:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10217) paying the head of state the same head  
[2:50:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10219) of state it's not that because canada  
[2:50:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10221) and britain are two separate states  
[2:50:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10224) they're seen as separate states in the  
[2:50:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10226) united nations  
[2:50:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10227) they operate with separate set of laws  
[2:50:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10229) british law is not the same as canada  
[2:50:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10231) law you can't analogize between the two  
[2:50:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10234) and it is a bit frustrating uh john  
[2:50:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10236) because i know you know i'll you know  
[2:50:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10238) you're a nice guy and stuff but you you  
[2:50:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10240) give these analogies which just don't  
[2:50:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10242) make sense and you sort of give them as  
[2:50:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10244) though you know they're sort of you know  
[2:50:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10246) as though they're obvious and they're  
[2:50:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10248) not obvious and when you dig deeper i  
[2:50:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10250) don't think they really make them much  
[2:50:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10251) sense like for example you turn around  
[2:50:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10253) and say well you know  
[2:50:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10254) it makes sense under christianity why  
[2:50:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10257) little babies are killed because they  
[2:50:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10259) bear the sins of their fathers  
[2:51:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10261) yeah and that just that doesn't make any  
[2:51:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10263) sense to me makes more sense that god  
[2:51:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10265) created life and death to try people and  
[2:51:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10268) sometimes babies die in order to try  
[2:51:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10270) their parents and sometimes they are  
[2:51:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10272) prevent they're killed or that you know  
[2:51:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10275) god takes their life because he has  
[2:51:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10276) sovereignty to do so in order to save  
[2:51:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10279) them for something worse in the future  
[2:51:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10280) which may have been the sins that they  
[2:51:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10282) may have committed whatever it is god's  
[2:51:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10284) knowledge knows these things yeah that  
[2:51:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10286) makes more sense than to say yeah god's  
[2:51:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10289) punishing this little baby  
[2:51:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10291) you know this you know this is inception  
[2:51:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10294) within the uh mother's womb because it's  
[2:51:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10296) actually sinful  
[2:51:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10298) yeah  
[2:51:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10299) that just doesn't really make much sense  
[2:51:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10301) to me  
[2:51:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10302) sorry yeah paper round hey i mean i  
[2:51:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10305) don't i mean it doesn't really make  
[2:51:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10306) sense to me how god can kill sinners  
[2:51:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10308) kill their children say that it can be  
[2:51:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10310) soul building to children even though  
[2:51:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10312) they're they're dead or to their parents  
[2:51:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10315) their dad um that doesn't mean no i  
[2:51:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10317) didn't say that  
[2:51:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10318) i gave  
[2:52:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10324) the analogy was this was about the  
[2:52:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10326) pandemic how a pandemic  
[2:52:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10329) an illness can be for one set of people  
[2:52:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10332) a punishment and for another set of  
[2:52:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10334) people it could be a a soul building  
[2:52:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10336) could be a test it could elevate  
[2:52:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10339) i gave all of these things i didn't just  
[2:52:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10340) say so but i said it could elevate  
[2:52:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10342) remove their sins you know it could  
[2:52:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10345) grant them greater position within god  
[2:52:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10348) all of these things yeah so you know  
[2:52:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10350) please don't and now don't use what i  
[2:52:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10353) said as a way to directly analogize  
[2:52:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10356) based upon noah's flood that wasn't the  
[2:52:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10359) argument the argument was can one event  
[2:52:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10362) be applied as a punishment for one group  
[2:52:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10364) of people and yet not a punishment for  
[2:52:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10366) another group of people that was the  
[2:52:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10368) argument that was being brought forward  
[2:52:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10370) yeah so the argument  
[2:52:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10372) and  
[2:52:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10373) and i also  
[2:52:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10375) i also included a few other elements  
[2:52:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10376) there that were not addressed yes uh one  
[2:52:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10379) event can be used as a punishment for  
[2:53:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10380) one person and it could also be used in  
[2:53:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10382) it  
[2:53:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10383) to bring about some other and for some  
[2:53:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10385) other reason i'm not denying that what  
[2:53:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10387) i'm saying is does god have a right to  
[2:53:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10390) kill the innocent and i haven't really  
[2:53:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10392) heard a good response there you said  
[2:53:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10394) that he did with the old uh abraham and  
[2:53:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10398) ishmael  
[2:53:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10399) isaac thing that was your that's what  
[2:53:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10401) you came in with you you admitted that  
[2:53:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10403) at the very beginning  
[2:53:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10405) yeah that there is something no i  
[2:53:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10407) admitted that i don't know  
[2:53:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10412) right so a couple of things one in the  
[2:53:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10414) ishmael versus isaac one i use that in  
[2:53:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10417) the understanding of the quran in the  
[2:53:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10418) quran ishmael is an innocent person he  
[2:53:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10420) doesn't even have original son at least  
[2:53:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10422) them but you called him medic you used  
[2:53:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10425) you used the medeki as king and he had  
[2:53:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10427) the right and there was no no no you are  
[2:53:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10429) now  
[2:53:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10430) you're actually stronger which is  
[2:53:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10432) interesting but you know what's really  
[2:53:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10434) interesting is you're all over the place  
[2:53:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10436) because i made it very i'm not all over  
[2:53:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10438) the place  
[2:54:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10440) because hold on  
[2:54:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10441) hold on is did i say on christianity  
[2:54:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10444) when isaac was put and asked for his  
[2:54:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10446) life was he innocent  
[2:54:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10449) was he innocent john no  
[2:54:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10452) you don't believe he was innocent no  
[2:54:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10453) exactly everyone has original sin here  
[2:54:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10455) an islam is  
[2:54:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10457) is um is hot or is it or ishmael is he  
[2:54:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10461) innocent yeah he's innocent so i guess i  
[2:54:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10463) see that point but but yes but so  
[2:54:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10466) i'd ask because you're talking about  
[2:54:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10467) death so are animals innocent  
[2:54:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10470) are animals innocent yeah animals die  
[2:54:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10474) yeah animals don't have rights  
[2:54:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10477) what do you mean they don't have rights  
[2:54:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10479) they they're living beings you said life  
[2:54:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10481) itself was it was was  
[2:54:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10484) anything that existed  
[2:54:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10491) if the concept of death doesn't make  
[2:54:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10493) sense in the islamic world view for you  
[2:54:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10495) because it's not a punishment for sin  
[2:54:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10497) then how does the death of animals make  
[2:55:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10500) sense do you human beings have rights  
[2:55:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10504) what do you mean do you human beings  
[2:55:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10506) have rights in front of every everybody  
[2:55:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10508) has rights everything has rights animal  
[2:55:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10510) rights peta i don't i don't know  
[2:55:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10513) i don't think animals have rights so you  
[2:55:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10515) don't think the problem of animal  
[2:55:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10517) suffering is a problem yeah because when  
[2:55:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10519) you were talking before you don't think  
[2:55:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10520) it is  
[2:55:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10522) when the baby dies how do people have  
[2:55:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10525) right he doesn't i'm thinking he's  
[2:55:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10528) implying that they don't is that what  
[2:55:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10529) you're saying  
[2:55:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10530) persons have rights animals are not  
[2:55:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10532) persons  
[2:55:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10533) i don't care  
[2:55:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10535) yeah but but before you said oh well i i  
[2:55:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10538) don't think that would be satisfying  
[2:55:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10539) because when you know my neighbor's baby  
[2:55:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10542) dies they're upset and they cry for days  
[2:55:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10544) but well have you ever seen somebody  
[2:55:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10546) whose dog died i mean  
[2:55:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10549) they start crying like babies too they  
[2:55:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10551) they're oh my god they don't even bury  
[2:55:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10554) him in the backyard oh  
[2:55:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10556) poor charlie i guess john  
[2:56:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10560) just sort of bring this in there  
[2:56:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10563) is one second  
[2:56:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10564) vote yeah i'll all agree  
[2:56:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10567) on points appealing to you're appealing  
[2:56:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10569) to that but then when i appeal to you oh  
[2:56:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10571) you wanted to say that so it's just guys  
[2:56:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10573) i guess  
[2:56:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10574) john if i can just if we can just bring  
[2:56:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10576) this back to i guess it's like from my  
[2:56:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10578) perspective fine so you can have your  
[2:56:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10579) your your own like like perspective and  
[2:56:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10581) paradigm but i guess like if if we're  
[2:56:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10583) gonna look at it like like as as two  
[2:56:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10586) competing theories  
[2:56:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10587) it seems like you have to make  
[2:56:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10588) assumption after assumption i mean the  
[2:56:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10591) first of all i mean you're the man the  
[2:56:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10593) idea that death has  
[2:56:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10597) to be some kind of punishment that's i i  
[2:56:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10600) don't see why i need to assume that i  
[2:56:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10601) don't i don't see why i need to assume  
[2:56:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10603) that at all right and and you have to  
[2:56:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10605) make assumption after assumption about  
[2:56:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10607) god not being able or it being immoral  
[2:56:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10609) for god to take a being that he created  
[2:56:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10612) out of existence which is  
[2:56:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10614) very counterintuitive now it also seems  
[2:56:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10616) also seems like an added layer that  
[2:56:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10619) you're adding to your theory that's  
[2:57:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10620) gonna make it very implausible in  
[2:57:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10622) comparison to the very simple theory  
[2:57:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10625) that you know god created life and death  
[2:57:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10627) humans are accountable for their own  
[2:57:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10630) sins and god punishes people and  
[2:57:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10632) forgives people i mean that's that seems  
[2:57:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10634) simple  
[2:57:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10636) for you to say that probabilistically  
[2:57:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10638) what you're putting forward here is a  
[2:57:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10640) better deal  
[2:57:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10641) just overlooks  
[2:57:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10643) all the assumptions you have to add into  
[2:57:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10646) your premises in order for this to make  
[2:57:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10648) even in order for this to be even  
[2:57:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10650) intelligible it's just i i don't see how  
[2:57:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10653) uh  
[2:57:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10654) if if we're just if we're just comparing  
[2:57:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10656) competing theories i don't see how you  
[2:57:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10658) could say  
[2:57:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10659) that your one is more reasonable in any  
[2:57:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10662) way shape or form you have to make  
[2:57:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10663) assumption after assumption and just you  
[2:57:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10666) know the fact that you so you say things  
[2:57:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10668) like i don't see how death makes sense  
[2:57:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10671) under islam well  
[2:57:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10672) really i think it's just much more  
[2:57:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10674) obvious generally for human beings that  
[2:57:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10676) we don't see how an innocent person can  
[2:58:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10680) take on the punishment of other people  
[2:58:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10683) now you can give all these analogies and  
[2:58:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10684) appear appeal to different models of the  
[2:58:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10686) atonement and theories and try to  
[2:58:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10688) rationalize it but seriously which is  
[2:58:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10691) going to be a tougher task to do  
[2:58:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10693) that or rationalizing the idea to you  
[2:58:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10696) who thinks that death is inconceivable  
[2:58:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10698) the way it is on islam  
[2:58:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10700) is okay in the sense that it's just a  
[2:58:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10702) transition from one life to the other  
[2:58:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10704) and human beings are accountable for  
[2:58:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10707) their actions there's punishment and  
[2:58:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10708) there's reward it seems like just the  
[2:58:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10711) simple version  
[2:58:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10712) looks fine so you you you you just  
[2:58:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10715) giving it this this uh um you know look  
[2:58:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10718) of incredulity like how can that be the  
[2:58:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10720) case isn't gonna do enough work unless  
[2:58:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10722) maybe you give us like a contradiction  
[2:58:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10724) or something because intuitively really  
[2:58:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10726) it doesn't seem like it's a problem you  
[2:58:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10727) can say that it seems like that to you  
[2:58:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10729) but generally speaking i think most  
[2:58:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10731) people will agree that the idea of  
[2:58:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10733) substitutionary atonement or whatever  
[2:58:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10735) other model of atomic you're putting  
[2:58:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10736) forward here  
[2:58:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10737) is is not going to a really seem  
[2:59:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10741) in line with with what with the way we  
[2:59:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10743) see these things i find it kind of funny  
[2:59:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10744) that i'm expected to give a logical  
[2:59:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10746) contradiction but i've seen no attempt  
[2:59:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10748) at a logical contradiction in saying an  
[2:59:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10750) innocent person could pay the penalty  
[2:59:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10752) for a guilty person no i'm not i'm not  
[2:59:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10754) saying you have to what i'm so what i'm  
[2:59:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10756) saying is i'm not saying you have to  
[2:59:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10758) what i'm saying is it seems like give  
[2:59:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10760) considering there doesn't seem to be  
[2:59:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10763) anything that is counter-intuitive  
[2:59:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10765) or problematic with this concept and it  
[2:59:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10769) seems like you're you're you're just you  
[2:59:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10771) know  
[2:59:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10772) you you're just finding it  
[2:59:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10773) counter-intuitive isn't going to be  
[2:59:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10775) sufficient and you have to do more than  
[2:59:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10777) that and  
[2:59:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10779) counter-intuitive that a king  
[2:59:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10782) yes exactly exactly but that's what i'm  
[2:59:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10783) saying so i'm comparing two intuitions  
[2:59:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10785) what i'm saying is that it seems like  
[2:59:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10788) one one one of the intuitions is much  
[2:59:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10790) more shared the idea that it seems  
[2:59:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10794) absurd for somebody to take on the  
[2:59:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10796) punishment of another like to just take  
[2:59:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10799) on that liability and suffer for them  
[3:00:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10801) and that person all of a sudden being  
[3:00:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10803) okay not just okay being compatible with  
[3:00:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10806) god for some reason and the other  
[3:00:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10808) intuition that you know well death isn't  
[3:00:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10811) a punishment it's just a transition from  
[3:00:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10813) one life to another they're both  
[3:00:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10815) intuitions i'm what i'm saying  
[3:00:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10817) is that one seems much more far-fetched  
[3:00:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10819) than the other is it i mean is it much  
[3:00:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10822) more widely held  
[3:00:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10824) i'm i'm gonna have to disagree there  
[3:00:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10826) because i did bring up the point earlier  
[3:00:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10828) i think jake just dismissed it as a  
[3:00:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10830) point of emotion  
[3:00:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10832) um but it was a point that a lot of  
[3:00:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10833) people find a lot of pain in their  
[3:00:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10836) children dying they don't rationalize it  
[3:00:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10838) they see that it's unfair some people  
[3:00:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10841) don't even feel that yeah i didn't  
[3:00:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10843) disagree with that  
[3:00:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10845) john i didn't disagree with that that's  
[3:00:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10847) not the same so me not me being sad that  
[3:00:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10850) somebody i love died is not me thinking  
[3:00:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10852) that death is a punishment those two  
[3:00:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10853) aren't the same thing i can miss the  
[3:00:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10855) person i can i can be sad that the  
[3:00:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10857) person is gone that doesn't mean that oh  
[3:00:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10859) my god death is this evil thing that  
[3:01:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10861) happened to him nobody's thinking like  
[3:01:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10863) that we're thinking of a person we love  
[3:01:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10865) that we lost especially a believer  
[3:01:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10867) doesn't think that death is this evil  
[3:01:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10869) thing that took him away in punishment  
[3:01:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10871) no we just miss the person we long for  
[3:01:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10873) the person we want to be with the person  
[3:01:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10876) that's why we're sad we don't have this  
[3:01:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10878) you know vendetta again against death  
[3:01:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10880) and we're gonna go right now uh try to  
[3:01:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10882) try to uh bring it down because people  
[3:01:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10884) die no we don't like people we love  
[3:01:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10887) dying that doesn't mean that we think  
[3:01:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10889) death is a punishment i don't think  
[3:01:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10890) those two are the same thing  
[3:01:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10892) all right so  
[3:01:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10894) okay so death so you're just so we're  
[3:01:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10897) just going to start with the idea that  
[3:01:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10899) death is not necessarily going to be a  
[3:01:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10901) punishment here when an innocent person  
[3:01:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10903) dies alongside a guilty person when god  
[3:01:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10905) brings it out could have  
[3:01:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10907) stopped the innocent person from dying  
[3:01:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10908) but decides not to because yeah you  
[3:01:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10910) already know well  
[3:01:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10912) that's because that's god's will all  
[3:01:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10913) right fair enough we're just  
[3:01:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10915) we're just uh using two intuitions here  
[3:01:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10917) that but you agreed with it no i thought  
[3:02:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10920) you just said um a couple of minutes ago  
[3:02:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10922) maybe you could you can correct me if i  
[3:02:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10924) am agreeing with you here i'm just  
[3:02:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10925) saying oh you're agreeing okay yeah i'm  
[3:02:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10927) just saying if we're going to go with  
[3:02:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10928) that as being both as being shared or  
[3:02:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10930) counter-intuitive then fine but it's  
[3:02:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10932) just too counterintuitive no sorry maybe  
[3:02:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10934) i'm not understanding can you explain  
[3:02:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10936) what you're saying because because if  
[3:02:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10936) you're if you're saying that i'm okay  
[3:02:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10938) i'm just saying  
[3:02:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10940) i'm just saying if both p if me and you  
[3:02:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10942) find something counterintuitive and  
[3:02:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10944) we're just you know stuck in a lock of  
[3:02:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10947) incredulity then we should just move on  
[3:02:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10948) here and say there's something  
[3:02:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10950) counterintuitive just for the sake of  
[3:02:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10952) this discussion yeah yeah sure people  
[3:02:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10953) can decide for themselves sure i mean i  
[3:02:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10956) mean that's really what it's going to  
[3:02:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10957) boil down to in a lot of situations i'm  
[3:02:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10960) just saying that that if if from my  
[3:02:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10962) perspective i just think that it's quite  
[3:02:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10965) clear  
[3:02:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10966) what is is is is seems to be way more  
[3:02:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10968) counter-intuitive and uh i don't know i  
[3:02:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10971) mean i guess i guess we didn't we didn't  
[3:02:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10973) take enough enough of an in-depth look  
[3:02:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10975) into your argument to actually bring it  
[3:02:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10976) to an incoherence i just see a problem  
[3:02:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10978) right okay so all right but let me ask  
[3:03:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10981) you this can a head of state be punished  
[3:03:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10983) for something on behalf of on behalf of  
[3:03:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10985) their nation is that at all  
[3:03:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10988) yeah okay let me think about that  
[3:03:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10989) because i think there is a analogy  
[3:03:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10991) because okay no i'm not asking if  
[3:03:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10993) there's this knowledge i'm just saying  
[3:03:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10994) in general what would be  
[3:03:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10996) that  
[3:03:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10997) i'm sorry  
[3:03:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=10998) head of state is not a king not  
[3:03:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11000) necessarily but all kings are heads of  
[3:03:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11001) state  
[3:03:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11002) that's fine but now yes so so when you  
[3:03:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11005) say on behalf i don't i don't yeah my  
[3:03:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11007) point doesn't really require that so so  
[3:03:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11012) so john when you're when you're saying  
[3:03:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11014) when you're saying human being  
[3:03:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11016) when you're saying he's being punished  
[3:03:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11017) on behalf of his people his so you're  
[3:03:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11019) saying so his people would be guilty for  
[3:03:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11021) something right  
[3:03:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11022) yep but let's say murder right so people  
[3:03:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11025) are guilty for like murder he he is not  
[3:03:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11028) right  
[3:03:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11030) yeah the guy did not murder anyone  
[3:03:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11032) yeah the guy did not murder anyone and  
[3:03:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11035) is not associated  
[3:03:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11037) with the murder of anyone like i mean he  
[3:03:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11039) is in any way shape or form responsible  
[3:04:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11042) for the crime directly indirectly he is  
[3:04:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11045) their monarch is he not so he's  
[3:04:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11047) associated so so he's associated with  
[3:04:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11050) the crime right  
[3:04:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11051) now  
[3:04:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11052) okay so so  
[3:04:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11054) maybe in international law yeah  
[3:04:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11056) the the the king can take on some  
[3:04:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11060) punishment that would i don't know if it  
[3:04:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11061) would settle it but then it makes sense  
[3:04:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11063) for him to take it on because he's  
[3:04:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11064) associated with the crime slash sin  
[3:04:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11068) which is something i wouldn't want to  
[3:04:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11069) say about god but let's just put that  
[3:04:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11071) aside for now but then the people  
[3:04:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11073) themselves i mean  
[3:04:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11075) uh uh um  
[3:04:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11076) when you look at the broader picture  
[3:04:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11078) right now like the people themselves  
[3:04:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11080) aren't the difference is it's  
[3:04:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11082) your the whole analogy is assuming that  
[3:04:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11085) that person is partially guilty for what  
[3:04:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11088) happened that's what i'm saying that's  
[3:04:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11090) what i'm saying  
[3:04:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11092) it's not that that's why that's exactly  
[3:04:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11094) what i said i wouldn't want to say that  
[3:04:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11095) about god all right all right so okay  
[3:04:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11097) maybe maybe we could take it  
[3:04:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11099) okay you could respond to that point  
[3:05:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11100) yeah all right i'll respond to that  
[3:05:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11101) point so let's say this let's say that  
[3:05:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11105) uh the original head of it was under  
[3:05:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11107) another head of state  
[3:05:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11108) that head of state does just in the same  
[3:05:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11110) way adam dies even though he's  
[3:05:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11112) considered the head of human  
[3:05:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11114) of humanity because we all inherit his  
[3:05:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11116) nature  
[3:05:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11117) now  
[3:05:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11118) under him and everyone else who is is  
[3:05:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11121) his biological heir who inherits uh his  
[3:05:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11124) punishment  
[3:05:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11125) um because he does and they'll die and  
[3:05:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11128) his position or office is left vacant  
[3:05:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11131) we want to say whoever takes up that  
[3:05:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11133) position again has to also take up his  
[3:05:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11135) punishment  
[3:05:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11136) so it could stay vacant no one has to  
[3:05:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11138) take up the punishment but if someone  
[3:05:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11140) does they would have to bear it  
[3:05:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11142) what would be the issue in stipulating  
[3:05:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11144) that anyone who takes on a certain  
[3:05:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11145) office has to take on the guilt  
[3:05:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11148) associated with that office  
[3:05:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11150) okay so  
[3:05:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11151) okay so then you're saying that there's  
[3:05:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11152) guilt there stipulated at the office yes  
[3:05:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11156) no yeah why does god have guilt  
[3:05:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11159) um well he has guilt and virtue of being  
[3:06:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11162) incarnate and taking up that office it's  
[3:06:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11164) a guilt he takes on but nothing natural  
[3:06:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11166) to him  
[3:06:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11167) yeah so what is it what does it mean for  
[3:06:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11169) god to be guilty of something  
[3:06:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11171) it means that he bears an office which  
[3:06:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11173) has a certain debt to it that if he  
[3:06:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11176) takes it up has to pay that debt  
[3:06:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11178) or would be or would  
[3:06:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11180) would be him binding himself to pay back  
[3:06:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11182) that debt  
[3:06:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11184) yeah and for us to even say that god  
[3:06:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11187) could be guilty of anything just  
[3:06:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11189) doesn't sound right  
[3:06:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11192) um in virtue of what in virtue of his  
[3:06:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11194) nature i agree in virtue of the office  
[3:06:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11196) that he voluntarily takes up i don't see  
[3:06:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11199) why not so he's doing something contrary  
[3:06:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11201) to his nature  
[3:06:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11203) it's not his office is not a part of his  
[3:06:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11205) nature it's something that's secondary  
[3:06:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11207) to it  
[3:06:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11209) how does that work on divine simplicity  
[3:06:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11212) because it's associated with the  
[3:06:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11214) internet it's always you only have is  
[3:06:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11216) nature you don't have anything  
[3:06:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11218) additional  
[3:06:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11219) uh well yeah we have the incarnation so  
[3:07:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11222) the incarnation is it's  
[3:07:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11224) taken up in virtue of a relational  
[3:07:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11226) property basically  
[3:07:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11228) god has a virtual relation with his uh  
[3:07:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11230) human nature and his human nature has a  
[3:07:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11232) real relation with him  
[3:07:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11234) and he because of the incarnation he  
[3:07:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11237) become he takes on the nature of man and  
[3:07:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11239) he can take on any office associated  
[3:07:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11241) that a man can take up i don't really  
[3:07:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11243) see the issue yeah honestly i i can't  
[3:07:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11246) take much more of this i think we should  
[3:07:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11248) move on guys  
[3:07:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11250) i i i was i was um  
[3:07:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11253) i wanted to impress a bit more abdul  
[3:07:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11255) we've been going for over three hours  
[3:07:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11257) and we've got two people waiting for a  
[3:07:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11259) long time and it's just  
[3:07:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11260) more and more added on more and more  
[3:07:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11263) complicated metaphysical assumptions to  
[3:07:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11266) the whole theory it just keeps getting  
[3:07:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11268) worse and worse yeah i just  
[3:07:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11270) always find john's discussions  
[3:07:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11272) interesting but yeah i guess i guess we  
[3:07:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11273) could pick it up some of the time then  
[3:07:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11276) well i'm in the chat  
[3:07:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11278) okay okay great okay we're gonna go to  
[3:08:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11281) you're gonna go to um  
[3:08:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11283) actually you know what we should look at  
[3:08:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11285) the super chats first before we even  
[3:08:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11287) bring anybody on  
[3:08:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11289) um  
[3:08:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11291) so what was the last one because if he  
[3:08:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11294) kneel so his future  
[3:08:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11295) yeah  
[3:08:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11297) i got it  
[3:08:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11299) yeah i found it here um  
[3:08:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11301) one second let me bring it up okay jake  
[3:08:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11305) another 10 super chat they try to link  
[3:08:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11308) the theory of substitution with the ram  
[3:08:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11310) linking jesus to it i.e making it the  
[3:08:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11313) sacrificial lamb  
[3:08:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11315) yeah that's right he did that uh several  
[3:08:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11318) times  
[3:08:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11319) um  
[3:08:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11321) also the idea of punishing an innocent  
[3:08:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11323) person for no reason is illogical and  
[3:08:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11325) i've dealt with christians with this  
[3:08:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11327) type of idea  
[3:08:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11329) okay yeah we've just seen that on  
[3:08:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11332) display with john  
[3:08:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11334) and otangelo before that  
[3:08:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11337) and then i think he sent another one  
[3:08:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11338) here okay  
[3:09:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11340) prophet jonah yunus alaihi salaam was  
[3:09:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11344) punished for disobedience to the  
[3:09:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11346) commands of was punished for his  
[3:09:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11348) disobedience to the commands of allah  
[3:09:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11351) did the rest of the people on the boat  
[3:09:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11353) go got drowned  
[3:09:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11355) asking with him  
[3:09:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11358) the city of nineveh repented  
[3:09:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11362) um  
[3:09:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11365) i don't know what the question really is  
[3:09:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11367) this was said in the context of the uh  
[3:09:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11370) you know innocent people dying and like  
[3:09:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11372) uh yeah because i was the one who  
[3:09:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11373) brought up jonah i said that  
[3:09:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11376) the people though and the the quran  
[3:09:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11378) actually mentions this is one of the  
[3:09:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11380) unique situations where an entire nation  
[3:09:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11383) actually repented  
[3:09:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11384) um and they were forgiven and there was  
[3:09:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11386) no sacrifice so that's what my point was  
[3:09:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11388) is that a sacrifice wasn't needed for an  
[3:09:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11391) entire nation that repented god forgave  
[3:09:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11394) them  
[3:09:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11395) um you know the other thing it show  
[3:09:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11398) there's another thing about that the  
[3:09:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11399) first part of it which is said you know  
[3:10:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11401) the people on the boat they didn't get  
[3:10:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11403) punished  
[3:10:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11404) right right right okay that's what his  
[3:10:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11406) point was that's the one who i think he  
[3:10:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11408) was trying to focus on that one yeah  
[3:10:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11410) because the people on the boat weren't  
[3:10:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11412) punished for what jonah did it was his  
[3:10:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11414) point i think right  
[3:10:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11416) okay uh  
[3:10:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11418) i think that was it  
[3:10:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11420) unless i missed another one there's one  
[3:10:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11423) more he sent a neil martial  
[3:10:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11434) only guilty for his sin  
[3:10:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11436) and disobedience we don't have to be  
[3:10:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11439) guilty on his behalf yeah that's correct  
[3:10:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11441) we don't believe that as muslims that  
[3:10:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11443) we're guilty or that we die because adam  
[3:10:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11446) sinned we don't have this  
[3:10:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11448) christian idea  
[3:10:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11449) was that  
[3:10:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11450) one  
[3:10:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11452) question  
[3:10:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11455) yeah so uh but yeah he called me yeah  
[3:10:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11458) yeah you know it's security because it's  
[3:10:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11459) my other name so uh just for those on  
[3:11:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11462) here uh  
[3:11:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11463) the question was so he did mention that  
[3:11:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11467) the  
[3:11:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11468) the orthodox opinion that there is no  
[3:11:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11471) original sin  
[3:11:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11473) it came about through bad what he called  
[3:11:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11476) bad russian orthodox  
[3:11:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11478) theology but then if you go  
[3:11:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11480) further back it wasn't the case do you  
[3:11:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11482) know anything about that  
[3:11:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11485) me i don't think that that's accurate i  
[3:11:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11488) think that um  
[3:11:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11490) there's a difference on original sin  
[3:11:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11494) that  
[3:11:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11495) goes back much further than that and  
[3:11:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11498) actually there was recently a debate  
[3:11:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11501) on a channel channel that i'm going to  
[3:11:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11503) be on soon called reason and theology  
[3:11:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11505) which john knows it's actually a  
[3:11:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11506) catholic channel  
[3:11:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11508) where a catholic was debating  
[3:11:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11512) a protestant what was the subject again  
[3:11:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11515) and i can't remember off top my head but  
[3:11:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11517) it wound up coming down to their  
[3:11:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11519) different views on original sin  
[3:12:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11523) and he wasn't saying hey look this idea  
[3:12:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11525) was created only a couple hundred years  
[3:12:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11527) ago by these  
[3:12:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11528) um heretical  
[3:12:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11531) greek orthodox so yeah i don't  
[3:12:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11533) i mean john didn't go into detail on  
[3:12:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11536) that but i don't think that that was  
[3:12:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11537) accurate i don't  
[3:12:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11540) yeah i don't know much more to say about  
[3:12:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11541) it  
[3:12:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11542) but um  
[3:12:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11544) anyway we've got now we've got three

[3:13:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11609) want to comment on what the previous

[3:13:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11617) when they're  
[3:13:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11618) biblically coherent and not and i won't  
[3:13:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11621) speak further than that  
[3:13:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11623) okay yeah go ahead so you you want to  
[3:13:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11626) give your um i guess take on on the  
[3:13:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11629) topic  
[3:13:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11630) yeah sure um that would be that'd be a  
[3:13:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11633) fun time right  
[3:13:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11635) okay so  
[3:13:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11638) i think christians are normally  
[3:14:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11640) conflating some terms from within the  
[3:14:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11642) text and because of it deeply deeply  
[3:14:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11644) confused and i think i'm not confused on  
[3:14:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11646) that same point and that's this  
[3:14:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11649) that  
[3:14:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11650) the father  
[3:14:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11652) in christian terms  
[3:14:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11654) is  
[3:14:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11655) is the one who does the job that jesus  
[3:14:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11658) sees do the job before him that is the  
[3:14:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11660) job of jesus  
[3:14:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11661) after all in the text jesus is not doing  
[3:14:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11664) the job of god  
[3:14:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11666) he's doing the job of jesus so in order  
[3:14:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11668) that he says something like i am doing  
[3:14:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11670) what i have seen my father do before me  
[3:14:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11672) that means his father was a jesus  
[3:14:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11678) good so far  
[3:14:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11680) okay  
[3:14:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11681) yeah  
[3:14:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11682) okay so that's that's a really common  
[3:14:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11684) misunderstanding as part of the text  
[3:14:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11686) they strictly have to ignore  
[3:14:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11689) and and to maintain their their theology  
[3:14:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11691) their doctrine from within whatever  
[3:14:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11693) church  
[3:14:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11694) that they have that doesn't maintain  
[3:14:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11695) that and here's why they have to  
[3:14:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11697) maintain that they have to maintain that  
[3:14:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11699) because they  
[3:15:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11700) they accidentally are conflating the  
[3:15:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11702) father with god  
[3:15:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11706) so  
[3:15:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11707) it doesn't matter say for instance uh  
[3:15:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11710) any of you gentlemen  
[3:15:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11712) if if you any of you perfectly adhered  
[3:15:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11716) to all of the requests  
[3:15:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11718) demands whatever you want to call them  
[3:15:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11720) of allah would that make you allah  
[3:15:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11724) no  
[3:15:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11725) you see that's what christians are doing  
[3:15:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11727) there  
[3:15:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11729) when the bible claims that the father  
[3:15:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11730) perfectly adheres as yahweh and acts on  
[3:15:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11734) reality as yahwah they conflate that as  
[3:15:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11736) being yahweh you see the problem  
[3:15:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11739) okay yeah and then they're doing the  
[3:15:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11741) same thing with jesus  
[3:15:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11743) yes yes they are  
[3:15:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11745) it makes absolutely zeros it's why they  
[3:15:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11748) can't justify their position from within  
[3:15:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11749) the text  
[3:15:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11752) for instance uh someone might say  
[3:15:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11753) something like  
[3:15:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11756) you have adam's sin on you  
[3:16:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11761) uh because adam sinned right  
[3:16:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11764) because they need to justify why you are  
[3:16:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11766) guilty from birth  
[3:16:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11769) so that they can maintain that god did  
[3:16:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11771) nothing immoral in their own view  
[3:16:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11774) when obviously  
[3:16:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11777) it's according to their view immoral to  
[3:16:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11779) kill someone  
[3:16:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11781) on the part of god right so that they  
[3:16:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11783) can't justify it that way but they have  
[3:16:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11785) to ignore lines like when the father  
[3:16:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11788) eats sour grapes the sun's teeth are not  
[3:16:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11791) set on edge  
[3:16:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11794) they'll ignore things like that which is  
[3:16:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11796) an obvious illusion saying  
[3:16:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11798) saying look  
[3:16:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11799) you are not guilty for what your parents  
[3:16:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11801) did except that if you adopt their ideas  
[3:16:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11804) you can carry on a curse  
[3:16:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11806) yeah right  
[3:16:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11808) okay so all that's coherent so far  
[3:16:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11810) yeah i mean i didn't bring up that  
[3:16:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11812) particular verse but i brought up other  
[3:16:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11814) ones like it and it seemed like they  
[3:16:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11816) were ignored  
[3:16:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11817) i found it extremely frustrating to sit  
[3:16:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11819) here and watch this  
[3:17:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11821) yeah and not necessary at all  
[3:17:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11825) okay so  
[3:17:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11827) i'm i'm trying to understand maybe i  
[3:17:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11829) don't know uh maybe i could uh make a  
[3:17:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11831) strong assertion and you guys could  
[3:17:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11833) critique that or something  
[3:17:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11834) would that be okay  
[3:17:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11836) okay  
[3:17:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11837) now i have to admit that by most measure  
[3:17:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11840) i'm a heretic  
[3:17:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11841) but i truly believe that a heretic is  
[3:17:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11843) someone you spoke to too long and you  
[3:17:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11845) discovered the differences  
[3:17:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11849) and and the guy that you went to church  
[3:17:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11851) with for 20 years down at you know bible  
[3:17:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11853) baptist  
[3:17:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11854) uh he's a heretic too you just didn't  
[3:17:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11856) talk to him enough  
[3:17:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11858) so i don't know what that term even  
[3:17:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11859) means in real in in real usefulness um  
[3:17:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11864) okay  
[3:17:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11865) so  
[3:17:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11867) geez what's an assertion i can make that  
[3:17:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11869) you guys would would i want to do  
[3:17:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11870) something super fundamental tell me  
[3:17:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11872) something fundamental within the bible  
[3:17:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11875) i'll make a claim about it  
[3:17:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11878) uh i don't know  
[3:18:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11881) richard the topic obviously is about  
[3:18:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11883) salvation i want to try and keep it  
[3:18:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11885) focused okay cool let's do that so  
[3:18:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11888) obviously with christianity that they  
[3:18:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11890) believe that  
[3:18:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11891) uh  
[3:18:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11893) you know god incarnated onto the earth  
[3:18:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11896) that  
[3:18:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11897) you know jesus was an innocent man  
[3:18:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11899) therefore was able to take up all the  
[3:18:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11901) burden of sin  
[3:18:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11902) and be that perfect sin sacrifice and  
[3:18:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11905) because it's god that's killing himself  
[3:18:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11908) uh he's a right to cover everybody  
[3:18:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11910) else's sin  
[3:18:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11913) i i could actually defend that better  
[3:18:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11915) than i've heard a person defend it even  
[3:18:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11916) though i don't hold the position and  
[3:18:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11917) here's how i would defend that it's  
[3:18:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11918) god's fault we're here  
[3:18:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11921) he does need to pay himself but that's  
[3:18:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11923) another that's another thing  
[3:18:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11925) well it could be the case that god  
[3:18:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11927) doesn't have to  
[3:18:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11928) if god created us anyway  
[3:18:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11931) sure god created a situation in which we  
[3:18:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11933) commit sin it could be the case that god  
[3:18:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11935) doesn't have to require any right  
[3:18:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11937) punishment why not just say that monarch  
[3:19:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11940) butterfly right there must be smashed  
[3:19:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11942) under a foot why not just say that  
[3:19:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11947) uh yeah yeah but i think what they would  
[3:19:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11948) probably argue is that god is just  
[3:19:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11951) and therefore god wouldn't just  
[3:19:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11953) arbitrarily undertake actions but rather  
[3:19:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11956) they would follow from a just  
[3:19:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11957) perspective  
[3:19:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11959) yeah but they'd also say he made up the  
[3:19:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11961) rules  
[3:19:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11963) uh yeah yeah they would say that they  
[3:19:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11965) made up the rules but they would all  
[3:19:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11968) they made up the rules  
[3:19:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11970) uh but then once he's made up the rules  
[3:19:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11972) he's now unabound to stick to them  
[3:19:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11975) by his nature  
[3:19:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11977) he couldn't just develop rules and then  
[3:19:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11979) arbitrarily break those rules that would  
[3:19:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11981) go against this nature  
[3:19:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11983) i understand they would maintain that  
[3:19:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11984) but they'd also maintain that  
[3:19:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11987) anything that god says dick takes  
[3:19:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11989) dictates what  
[3:19:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11990) logic is and we would believe it no  
[3:19:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11993) matter what like we would think the  
[3:19:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11994) monarch is a perfect sacrifice  
[3:19:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11997) for all of sin of mankind we would  
[3:19:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=11999) actually believe that  
[3:20:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12001) yeah but i think to be fair christians  
[3:20:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12003) like john fisher wouldn't accept that  
[3:20:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12005) position they wouldn't just simply say  
[3:20:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12007) god makes up the logic  
[3:20:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12010) i want to talk about i don't want to  
[3:20:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12011) talk about mr john fisher but but yes  
[3:20:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12014) they can be inconsistent that way  
[3:20:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12016) yeah so there will be others that would  
[3:20:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12018) be inconsistent yeah okay so so on  
[3:20:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12021) salvation i'll make a claim  
[3:20:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12023) um  
[3:20:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12024) that according the bible christ is not  
[3:20:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12026) there for the believer the believer is  
[3:20:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12028) already saved thereby his sacrifice  
[3:20:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12030) doesn't mean squat to the believer it's  
[3:20:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12032) not for them  
[3:20:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12034) now they might in pride say something  
[3:20:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12036) like i know so much  
[3:20:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12039) that i can be guilty but what the bible  
[3:20:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12041) says about believer non-believer is that  
[3:20:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12043) they're basically ignorant they perish  
[3:20:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12045) for lack of understanding  
[3:20:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12047) they don't have any knowledge they don't  
[3:20:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12048) have any wisdom please listen to me  
[3:20:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12050) because you don't get any of this that's  
[3:20:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12052) what the bible says about them  
[3:20:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12054) so it's just a matter of pride when they  
[3:20:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12056) say  
[3:20:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12057) something like i am guilty  
[3:21:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12060) and i need forgiveness  
[3:21:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12064) what do you think of that  
[3:21:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12069) so you're saying i am guilty and  
[3:21:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12072) i need forgiveness  
[3:21:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12074) is a pride problem  
[3:21:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12076) no no but who's saying that sorry  
[3:21:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12079) christians generally speaking  
[3:21:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12082) uh  
[3:21:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12083) yeah  
[3:21:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12084) so  
[3:21:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12086) i don't know i don't know if that's what  
[3:21:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12088) they would say  
[3:21:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12090) i think yeah they obviously say it  
[3:21:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12092) yeah so yeah so they would need yeah so  
[3:21:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12094) they would say yeah i am guilty i need  
[3:21:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12096) forgiveness i cannot forgive myself i am  
[3:21:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12099) not worthy of forgiveness therefore i  
[3:21:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12101) need somebody else  
[3:21:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12103) to be that perfect  
[3:21:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12106) uh punishment or sacrifice for my  
[3:21:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12109) forgiveness  
[3:21:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12110) so so here's my assertion the the  
[3:21:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12112) sacrifice of christ  
[3:21:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12115) uh the death and resurrection  
[3:21:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12118) is is a statement of medical authority  
[3:22:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12121) and understanding of what the human  
[3:22:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12122) animal is  
[3:22:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12124) performed in in sho and in front of a  
[3:22:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12127) group  
[3:22:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12128) that are non-believers  
[3:22:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12130) who who killed him etc right  
[3:22:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12134) and that that is to give them physical  
[3:22:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12136) evidence  
[3:22:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12138) that they've been asking for it has  
[3:22:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12140) nothing to do with the believer  
[3:22:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12142) whatsoever nor their sin and here's why  
[3:22:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12144) i justify that or how i justify that  
[3:22:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12148) is  
[3:22:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12148) if if i say that grace  
[3:22:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12151) makes sense  
[3:22:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12153) in the face of ignorance  
[3:22:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12155) we already know that you can't send a  
[3:22:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12157) three-year-old to jail i don't care they  
[3:22:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12159) can hold a shotgun pull the trigger in  
[3:22:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12160) grandpa's face blow his head right off  
[3:22:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12162) his shoulders three-year-old's not going  
[3:22:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12164) to jail come on because he doesn't  
[3:22:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12166) really understand what was actually  
[3:22:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12168) going to happen he just maybe knew it  
[3:22:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12169) was going to be exciting but that's  
[3:22:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12171) about it  
[3:22:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12172) so  
[3:22:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12173) it's obvious that grace is extended in  
[3:22:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12176) the face of ignorance  
[3:22:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12178) now is that grace perfectly just in the  
[3:23:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12180) face of that same ignorance well yes  
[3:23:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12182) obviously it makes total sense but  
[3:23:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12184) here's the part that can't be justified  
[3:23:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12187) you can't justify  
[3:23:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12189) grace  
[3:23:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12190) due to ignorance  
[3:23:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12192) right or innocence  
[3:23:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12194) which is perfectly just  
[3:23:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12197) and they suffer guilt they can't be both  
[3:23:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12199) you can't be both guilty and ignorant  
[3:23:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12202) you see  
[3:23:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12205) so what the bible is actually reading  
[3:23:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12206) that's being misunderstood is you are  
[3:23:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12209) ignorant  
[3:23:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12211) you can't be guilty  
[3:23:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12214) thus i extend you grace  
[3:23:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12217) how's that for a claim  
[3:23:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12224) well uh what was the last statement you  
[3:23:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12226) can't  
[3:23:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12228) i extend you grace because i i am aware  
[3:23:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12231) that you are ignorant stiff-necked

[3:24:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12253) mean i mean i think yeah i generally  
[3:24:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12255) think people get grace and mercy because  
[3:24:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12258) they  
[3:24:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12259) they do they need it  
[3:24:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12261) right that's what you're saying is that  
[3:24:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12263) the islamic position  
[3:24:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12264) normally yes everybody needs god's mercy  
[3:24:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12268) i don't know what i don't know what  
[3:24:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12269) christians are talking about but  
[3:24:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12270) whatever it is it ain't in the bible  
[3:24:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12274) so where do you think it came from  
[3:24:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12276) tradition probably  
[3:24:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12279) hmm  
[3:24:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12282) i mean obviously you you can't have  
[3:24:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12284) federal headship and and and born into  
[3:24:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12286) sin and guilt  
[3:24:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12288) while the bible says you're you're  
[3:24:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12289) ignorant  
[3:24:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12290) and and  
[3:24:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12292) you don't know my ways and the child  
[3:24:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12295) isn't punished for the father eating  
[3:24:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12297) sour grapes it says all these things  
[3:24:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12298) clearly  
[3:25:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12301) right yeah i don't know  
[3:25:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12304) christians so we don't really uh accept  
[3:25:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12307) these particular positions that  
[3:25:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12309) christians are the ones that consider  
[3:25:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12311) themselves orthodox  
[3:25:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12314) am i playing the game wrong tell me tell  
[3:25:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12315) me what to do i'll do that no no it's  
[3:25:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12318) fine don't worry we appreciate you  
[3:25:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12319) coming on but i like look the general  
[3:25:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12322) position from  
[3:25:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12323) you know uh  
[3:25:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12326) you know from what we sense regards to  
[3:25:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12328) christianity is that they sort of give  
[3:25:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12330) this a idea that  
[3:25:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12332) everybody's born of sin but like you  
[3:25:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12334) said the the children are not  
[3:25:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12337) yeah exactly so there's there's question  
[3:25:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12338) marks because of that then there's this  
[3:25:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12341) issue that every sin must be punished by  
[3:25:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12344) death  
[3:25:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12345) including a child in the womb of a  
[3:25:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12347) mother would be considered sinful and  
[3:25:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12349) therefore must die because it must be  
[3:25:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12351) punished  
[3:25:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12352) and then there's the idea that okay  
[3:25:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12354) yeah and then they say okay but god came  
[3:25:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12357) down he incarnated upon the earth  
[3:26:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12361) he died and he died as a way to get rid  
[3:26:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12364) of  
[3:26:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12366) the punishment of death  
[3:26:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12368) and then we're like well right people  
[3:26:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12369) still die who are christians so where  
[3:26:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12372) does that sure  
[3:26:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12373) so then okay then always just a  
[3:26:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12376) spiritual death or a  
[3:26:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12378) metaphorical death  
[3:26:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12380) and then this just this idea then to say  
[3:26:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12382) that  
[3:26:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12383) to argue that the guilty person who's  
[3:26:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12386) guilty of sin knowingly what he's done  
[3:26:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12389) shouldn't be the one that bears the  
[3:26:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12391) consequence of that  
[3:26:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12393) that that seems irrational  
[3:26:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12395) yeah then that seems a bit odd to us as  
[3:26:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12397) muslims because we're like no no the one  
[3:26:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12399) who  
[3:26:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12399) is guilty  
[3:26:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12401) yeah  
[3:26:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12402) you know getting rid of all the  
[3:26:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12403) circumstances of ignorance things like  
[3:26:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12406) that and not understanding get rid of  
[3:26:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12408) all of that then he bears responsibility  
[3:26:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12411) now he might repent  
[3:26:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12413) and realize he's done wrong and if he's  
[3:26:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12415) done that then he turns around to god  
[3:26:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12418) and god has the power to forgive him and  
[3:27:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12420) says he will forgive a person who  
[3:27:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12423) has made a mistake did air you know made  
[3:27:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12426) an error  
[3:27:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12428) but then regrets it to the point where  
[3:27:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12430) if he was put into the same position  
[3:27:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12433) he would not do the same mistake he  
[3:27:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12435) would change his ways  
[3:27:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12437) only god of course he would if he had  
[3:27:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12439) new information yeah yeah and only god  
[3:27:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12441) knows that only god knows whether that  
[3:27:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12444) person is being so truthful that if he  
[3:27:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12446) was to rewind the clock back  
[3:27:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12449) right  
[3:27:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12451) that's right he wouldn't make that yeah  
[3:27:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12452) exactly oh god no i don't know that no  
[3:27:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12454) other doesn't the doesn't the koran then  
[3:27:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12457) declare that we are short of certain  
[3:27:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12459) knowledge  
[3:27:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12460) yeah yeah exactly so we don't know  
[3:27:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12462) certain things what's the problem  
[3:27:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12463) there's no problem with that  
[3:27:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12465) no there isn't there isn't so that's  
[3:27:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12466) that's what we we tend to that's our  
[3:27:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12469) position in this night position but at  
[3:27:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12471) the same time we get a lot of christians  
[3:27:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12472) pushing back upon us saying no no did  
[3:27:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12474) you try talking to one that read the  
[3:27:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12476) bible  
[3:27:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12478) well i i you know to be honest angelo  
[3:28:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12481) john fisher they were you know they're  
[3:28:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12483) people that would say that they read the  
[3:28:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12485) bible they have particularly but i think  
[3:28:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12487) what is that because they read it within  
[3:28:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12489) a very specific lens  
[3:28:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12491) sure  
[3:28:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12492) and so as a result they focus upon this  
[3:28:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12494) particular aspect  
[3:28:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12496) within this paradigm of you know uh  
[3:28:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12500) penile atom  
[3:28:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12501) substitutionary atonement and so as a  
[3:28:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12504) result everything becomes good and until  
[3:28:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12506) they can step outside of that sort of  
[3:28:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12509) you know mindset and then look at things  
[3:28:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12511) anew it's very difficult for them to  
[3:28:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12514) look at those verses that you quoted and  
[3:28:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12516) then start to look at them in a with  
[3:28:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12518) with fresh eyes i think  
[3:28:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12521) maybe i did have a great advantage in  
[3:28:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12523) being an anti-theist when i read it  
[3:28:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12525) right yeah yeah

[3:29:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12589) comments on my question  
[3:29:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12592) rather statements  
[3:29:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12594) but the first question is uh  
[3:29:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12596) i met this person and and i think it was  
[3:29:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12599) i'm not sure if it's a he or she but we  
[3:30:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12601) talked about um  
[3:30:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12603) about hell and he was like  
[3:30:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12606) the reason why we muslims live in the  
[3:30:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12608) world is because we just prepare  
[3:30:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12609) ourselves to go to hell  
[3:30:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12611) and so we kind of like conflicting there  
[3:30:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12613) and he said that  
[3:30:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12614) he said that he believes that because of  
[3:30:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12617) a hadith saying that  
[3:30:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12620) only 1 out of 73 types of muslims can go  
[3:30:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12623) to like heaven and the other goes to  
[3:30:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12625) hell  
[3:30:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12626) so he was like what are the odds that  
[3:30:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12628) i'm going to you know not go to hell so  
[3:30:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12630) that's why i'm i'm in this world just to  
[3:30:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12633) prepare to go to hell and so  
[3:30:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12635) we kind of got into like an argument  
[3:30:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12638) i was like um  
[3:30:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12640) but  
[3:30:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12641) aren't we here to prepare ourselves to  
[3:30:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12643) go to heaven why do you have to be so  
[3:30:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12645) pessimistic  
[3:30:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12647) and  
[3:30:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12648) you know play with the odds and  
[3:30:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12650) preparing yourself to go to the hell  
[3:30:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12653) and so i just want you guys to comment  
[3:30:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12655) on that  
[3:30:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12658) uh yeah so that's completely wrong way  
[3:31:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12661) to view  
[3:31:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12662) uh  
[3:31:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12663) islam and allah because  
[3:31:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12666) uh  
[3:31:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12667) firstly the hadith that he mentions the  
[3:31:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12669) hadith which is like used often which  
[3:31:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12672) says that  
[3:31:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12673) uh i think it's the jews split into 71  
[3:31:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12676) sex the jews split into 72 and the  
[3:31:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12679) muslims still split into 73 all of them  
[3:31:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12681) in hell fire  
[3:31:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12683) except one and then the sahabah the  
[3:31:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12686) companions asked who are the one and he  
[3:31:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12687) says those who are upon my way and the  
[3:31:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12690) way of my companions  
[3:31:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12691) you know to the effect yeah so  
[3:31:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12694) uh but that hadith is actually  
[3:31:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12695) considered hasan yeah it's not even it's  
[3:31:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12697) not some narrations  
[3:31:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12700) some some scholars of hadith don't  
[3:31:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12701) classify sahih they classify as hasan  
[3:31:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12704) which is one level down so it shouldn't  
[3:31:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12706) be used like as a  
[3:31:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12708) fundamental  
[3:31:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12710) you know akida point yeah to understand  
[3:31:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12713) secondly is that  
[3:31:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12715) when he talks about 73  
[3:31:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12717) uh sex differs yeah groupings  
[3:32:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12721) uh the assumption shouldn't be that  
[3:32:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12724) the one that is upon the haqq  
[3:32:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12727) yeah of islam  
[3:32:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12729) would be the minority it could be the  
[3:32:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12732) majority these could just be  
[3:32:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12734) 72 other  
[3:32:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12736) you know smaller groups and smaller  
[3:32:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12737) factions and we know for our history  
[3:32:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12739) there have been various small groups and  
[3:32:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12741) factions that have never become the  
[3:32:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12743) majority you know there may have been a  
[3:32:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12745) majority of one time like the marta  
[3:32:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12747) zilla had certain prominence during the  
[3:32:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12750) uh  
[3:32:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12751) early abbasid khilafah but later it  
[3:32:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12754) became less prominent to the extent that  
[3:32:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12756) we don't really have material  
[3:32:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12759) or others similar to that  
[3:32:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12761) today so you know just to be aware that  
[3:32:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12764) it doesn't necessitate that and also by  
[3:32:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12766) the way the idea of 73 the 70 in the  
[3:32:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12770) arabic language is normally used as a  
[3:32:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12772) metaphor yeah so it's normal it doesn't  
[3:32:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12774) just mean there's literally 73 i need to  
[3:32:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12777) count each one it can mean  
[3:33:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12780) multiples of 70 or 70 and you know  
[3:33:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12783) slightly above yeah  
[3:33:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12785) so you know it can be understood in that  
[3:33:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12787) context  
[3:33:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12788) yeah kind of like in english i will use  
[3:33:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12790) several from seven yeah like a dozen  
[3:33:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12793) it's like a specific it's 12 but it's  
[3:33:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12795) not exactly 12 when you say it doesn't  
[3:33:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12798) well you can say you're baker's dozen  
[3:33:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12799) which is 13 that's what they say in  
[3:33:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12802) england yeah so that's first thing yeah  
[3:33:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12806) and the second thing is this is that um  
[3:33:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12808) in terms of how we therefore approach  
[3:33:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12811) islam  
[3:33:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12812) i think it's a statement  
[3:33:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12816) you know if i had i don't like to quote  
[3:33:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12818) without knowing exactly the the precise  
[3:33:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12821) quote so but i'll give the general point  
[3:33:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12823) so i won't mention  
[3:33:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12825) who said it  
[3:33:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12826) but it was mentioned i think he's a  
[3:33:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12827) companion who said that if all if if  
[3:33:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12830) there's a voice from heaven said every  
[3:33:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12833) single person will enter paradise except  
[3:33:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12835) for one person he goes that  
[3:33:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12838) he goes i will fear that that one person  
[3:34:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12840) would be me  
[3:34:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12841) that's not going to happen  
[3:34:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12843) and then he said and if there's a voice  
[3:34:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12845) from heaven either angel said that all  
[3:34:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12847) people will go to hell fight except for  
[3:34:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12849) one person he said  
[3:34:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12851) i would hope and have the the the any  
[3:34:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12854) the optimism that that one person who's  
[3:34:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12856) not going to go to alpha is me  
[3:34:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12859) the idea is this is that as muslims we  
[3:34:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12862) sit between fear and hope yeah this idea  
[3:34:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12865) that  
[3:34:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12866) you know we're not so pessimistic that  
[3:34:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12869) we think you know allah will not grant  
[3:34:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12872) us salvation will not grant us mercy or  
[3:34:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12874) forgiveness  
[3:34:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12876) neither are we  
[3:34:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12877) sit in a position which we think oh we  
[3:34:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12879) can do whatever we want because allah  
[3:34:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12881) will forgive us and he's the most  
[3:34:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12883) merciful no we sit within the idea that  
[3:34:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12886) allah  
[3:34:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12888) he is the one that will  
[3:34:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12891) uh grant us forgiveness and mercy  
[3:34:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12893) inshallah but he's also the one that  
[3:34:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12895) punishes yeah and holds us to account  
[3:34:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12898) and he's just and so therefore we are in  
[3:35:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12901) a position where we fear allah's uh you  
[3:35:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12904) know anger  
[3:35:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12906) and displeasure at the same time we hope  
[3:35:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12909) in allah's mercy and pleasure upon what  
[3:35:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12912) we do and that gives us that  
[3:35:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12914) that balance of not being pessimistic or  
[3:35:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12917) overly optimistic but in the same way  
[3:35:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12920) our optimism should always be slightly  
[3:35:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12923) more than now pessimism yeah as a  
[3:35:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12925) believer so  
[3:35:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12927) i mean  
[3:35:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12928) his his approach in how he how he's  
[3:35:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12930) seeing things  
[3:35:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12931) seems to be incorrect i don't know if he  
[3:35:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12934) has issues with regards to obedience to  
[3:35:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12935) islam is he practicing muslim or  
[3:35:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12939) um  
[3:35:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12940) he said to me that he's he's practicing  
[3:35:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12943) and  
[3:35:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12944) um  
[3:35:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12945) he said something about sadaka like um  
[3:35:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12948) like if i were to go to hell at least my  
[3:35:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12950) hands won't burn or something because  
[3:35:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12952) you know because he believes that in  
[3:35:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12954) this world we're preparing to go to hell  
[3:35:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12956) and so i was like  
[3:35:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12959) you know i would rather go to heaven  
[3:36:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12960) rather than just have all of my body  
[3:36:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12963) burn but my hands so it's like you know  
[3:36:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12966) pessimism and optimism and i say to him  
[3:36:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12968) like i do a lot of sins too but i never  
[3:36:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12970) never ever want to even believe  
[3:36:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12973) that i go to hell  
[3:36:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12975) yeah good he has problems  
[3:36:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12977) yeah but that's how a muslim should be a  
[3:36:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12979) muslim should be he's not a person who  
[3:36:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12980) thinks  
[3:36:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12981) we're just preparing ourselves to go to  
[3:36:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12984) hell rather muslim thinks  
[3:36:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12986) that we are seeking the pleasure of  
[3:36:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12987) allah and that we hope for that pleasure  
[3:36:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12990) uh maybe yahya or  
[3:36:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12992) uh you can mention the hadith  
[3:36:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12995) which is that think of uh allah  
[3:36:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=12998) subhanahu ta is with you as you think of  
[3:36:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13000) him i don't know if you come across this  
[3:36:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13002) hadith as yeah yeah yeah yeah he's  
[3:36:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13005) exactly that's a good one  
[3:36:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13008) yeah so the hadith is basically if you  
[3:36:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13010) think  
[3:36:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13011) yeah so if you think first of all  
[3:36:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13014) yeah so if you could think thoughts that  
[3:36:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13015) other sponsors go he's going to punish  
[3:36:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13017) you that's how allah will be with you  
[3:36:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13019) but if you think that allah is the  
[3:37:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13020) person who will be showing you mercy and  
[3:37:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13022) forgiveness then also that's how allah  
[3:37:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13025) will be with you that's how you're meant  
[3:37:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13027) to think so at the same time we're not  
[3:37:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13029) like overly optimistic and saying yeah  
[3:37:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13031) you know i can do whatever i want but at  
[3:37:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13033) the same time we never we don't have  
[3:37:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13035) negative thoughts about allah in terms  
[3:37:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13037) of how it relates to us but rather we  
[3:37:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13040) always think that allah will show his  
[3:37:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13041) mercy and forgiveness insha allah  
[3:37:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13045) i i don't know if you're looking for the  
[3:37:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13047) hadith are you  
[3:37:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13049) yeah

[3:37:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13079) so the way my slave perceives me i am  
[3:38:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13082) that essentially  
[3:38:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13084) yeah  
[3:38:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13086) so yeah so maybe quote him  
[3:38:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13088) maybe quote him that hedy that might  
[3:38:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13090) help him  
[3:38:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13095) uh one other thing i could also add um  
[3:38:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13098) just you know and again  
[3:38:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13100) we're assuming that this is going to be  
[3:38:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13102) you know  
[3:38:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13103) we're as not assumed but as a brother  
[3:38:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13106) sheriff said it's not that this is going  
[3:38:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13108) to be used for akita for you know credo  
[3:38:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13110) making credo judgments but  
[3:38:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13113) just you know as another side no  
[3:38:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13116) being and how like those 72 that are in  
[3:38:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13119) hell it doesn't necessarily entail a  
[3:38:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13121) permanent residence in hell  
[3:38:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13124) yeah that could oh yeah that's all right  
[3:38:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13126) that's right yeah he also mentioned that  
[3:38:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13129) as well he was like preparing to go to  
[3:38:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13130) hell and then one day i mean we were  
[3:38:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13132) going to go to heaven anyways as long as  
[3:38:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13133) you're a muslim and i'm like  
[3:38:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13135) can you really  
[3:38:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13137) you know bear the pain even for a while  
[3:39:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13140) do you really want that pain so i was  
[3:39:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13142) like you know  
[3:39:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13143) a little bit  
[3:39:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13145) inquisitive about that but yeah yeah if  
[3:39:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13147) you guys don't mind can i ask like it's  
[3:39:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13149) like not really a question but really  
[3:39:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13152) like um i want to know what's your  
[3:39:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13153) opinion on something  
[3:39:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13156) yeah sure yeah we're gonna have to end  
[3:39:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13158) the stream relatively soon so we'll  
[3:39:20](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13160) probably leave this okay i'll try not to  
[3:39:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13163) take your um  
[3:39:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13165) time too much but i was thinking like  
[3:39:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13167) i've been i've been living my whole life  
[3:39:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13169) thinking that you know  
[3:39:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13170) it's i think it's obvious that we should  
[3:39:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13173) search happiness but then  
[3:39:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13175) one day i was thinking like you know  
[3:39:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13176) sometimes pain can bring benefit as well  
[3:39:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13178) so i was thinking  
[3:39:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13180) like maybe we're not fighting for  
[3:39:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13182) happiness  
[3:39:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13183) and and not desiring pain as well but  
[3:39:45](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13185) rather like  
[3:39:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13187) we desire happiness but pain is not  
[3:39:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13189) desirable but it's just part of  
[3:39:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13192) life when you're trying to search for  
[3:39:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13194) the meaning of life  
[3:39:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13195) and so i think  
[3:39:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13197) one of the purpose of life is trying to  
[3:39:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13199) find meaning and that meaning is  
[3:40:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13202) different from like a muslim and a  
[3:40:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13204) non-muslim  
[3:40:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13205) or like an atheist or an atheist for  
[3:40:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13208) example do you agree with that statement  
[3:40:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13211) well let me understand so let me just  
[3:40:13](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13213) really understand what you're trying to  
[3:40:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13214) so you're saying that rather than being  
[3:40:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13217) rather than trying to pursue happiness  
[3:40:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13219) what we really should be doing is  
[3:40:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13221) pursuing meaning and purpose  
[3:40:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13223) yeah and then and that happiness and  
[3:40:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13225) pain is what you get from you know  
[3:40:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13227) searching that meaning  
[3:40:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13230) okay so yeah yeah you gonna say  
[3:40:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13233) i think you know there's a fundamental  
[3:40:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13235) thing that needs to be kept in mind like  
[3:40:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13237) you know what you're talking about what  
[3:40:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13238) makes a person happy what makes a person  
[3:40:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13241) you know sad these things the things  
[3:40:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13242) that you brought up the  
[3:40:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13244) these the feelings that we have they're  
[3:40:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13246) also created by allah in us it's you  
[3:40:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13250) know it's a basic example but like you  
[3:40:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13252) didn't choose to like or dislike tea you  
[3:40:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13255) just found yourself liking it or you  
[3:40:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13257) didn't just now i'm not negating that we  
[3:41:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13260) have  
[3:41:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13261) the fact that we have choices we do have  
[3:41:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13262) choices to actually drink it even if we  
[3:41:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13265) like it or dislike it but we don't have  
[3:41:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13267) that you know uh  
[3:41:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13269) that it's programmed in us you know some  
[3:41:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13271) people call that football or they call  
[3:41:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13272) use other words for it  
[3:41:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13274) that's fine that's not that you know the  
[3:41:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13276) word's not important but so looking at  
[3:41:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13279) that when you know chasing happiness i  
[3:41:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13282) mean  
[3:41:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13283) what makes you happy and in the end it  
[3:41:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13284) is allah who's giving you that  
[3:41:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13286) happiness uh  
[3:41:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13288) you know maybe when somebody feels guilt  
[3:41:30](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13290) shame or other things this is a message  
[3:41:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13291) from allah a  
[3:41:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13293) personal message from allah to the uh to  
[3:41:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13296) his  
[3:41:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13297) to his  
[3:41:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13298) that this is something that is not  
[3:41:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13301) wanted by god  
[3:41:43](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13303) that's one way to think of it and that  
[3:41:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13304) you know so you can one person finding  
[3:41:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13306) the meaning now i agree  
[3:41:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13307) the goal is to find the meaning but  
[3:41:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13310) one shouldn't think then that  
[3:41:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13313)Music 
[3:41:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13314) finding happiness or receiving you know  
[3:41:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13316) getting these feelings that they are  
[3:41:58](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13318) not a part of that meaning or search of  
[3:42:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13320) meaning they are a part of the meaning  
[3:42:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13322) and you know in the end  
[3:42:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13324) the uh or not in the end the beginning  
[3:42:05](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13325) you know this means  
[3:42:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13330) the  
[3:42:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13330) read in the name of your lord who  
[3:42:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13332) created who created them if you just  
[3:42:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13334) stop at that one ayah you're basically  
[3:42:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13336) getting at reading yeah search for  
[3:42:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13338) meaning  
[3:42:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13339) but in what way do you do that by  
[3:42:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13342) reading  
[3:42:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13344) the things that your lord created so if  
[3:42:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13346) you you you know you see  
[3:42:28](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13348) that  
[3:42:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13349) you're not the owner necessarily of your  
[3:42:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13353) of your feeling of you know you don't  
[3:42:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13355) want to claim ownership over your your  
[3:42:37](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13357) existence and that includes you know  
[3:42:39](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13359) your feelings your emotions and other  
[3:42:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13361) things these are also created as a  
[3:42:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13364) message for you for all of us to read  
[3:42:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13368) and then that is an integral part of the  
[3:42:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13371) search for meaning it's not uh  
[3:42:54](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13374) one needs to be careful  
[3:42:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13375) it  
[3:42:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13376) otherwise you could fall into you know  
[3:42:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13379) the or a person could fall into the uh  
[3:43:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13381) the respond which is something that  
[3:43:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13382) we're not associated so it's kind of  
[3:43:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13384) like a secularized search of meaning  
[3:43:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13386) uh  
[3:43:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13387) which you know the the the christians  
[3:43:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13390) and the monasticism they kind of might  
[3:43:11](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13391) have they might have fallen into that as  
[3:43:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13394) the  
[3:43:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13394) quran  
[3:43:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13395) implies  
[3:43:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13397) so  
[3:43:18](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13398) that's something that one needs to keep  
[3:43:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13399) in mind i think i don't want to ramble  
[3:43:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13401) on too much  
[3:43:22](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13402) yeah although the issue is it is odd  
[3:43:25](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13405) isn't it pronouncing your name correct  
[3:43:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13406) um it's ideal ideal  
[3:43:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13409) idol okay like ideal i don't i think i  
[3:43:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13412) don't know if that's how you guys call  
[3:43:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13414) it all right  
[3:43:35](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13415) uh yeah so hey sorry  
[3:43:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13418) so the issue is this is that look  
[3:43:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13420) whether you whether you're muslim or not  
[3:43:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13422) muslim whether you're seeking purpose of  
[3:43:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13424) life or not you're gonna face  
[3:43:46](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13426) difficulties you're going to face what  
[3:43:48](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13428) you like pleasures isn't it so it's not  
[3:43:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13430) the  
[3:43:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13431) the the idea is that okay we  
[3:43:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13433) only want to strive to achieve happiness  
[3:43:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13436) but then on the way you're going to face  
[3:43:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13437) lots of problems and you may not be able  
[3:44:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13440) to achieve ultimate ultimately what you  
[3:44:03](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13443) perceive or what an individual might  
[3:44:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13444) perceive as happiness  
[3:44:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13446) so really that that becomes a bit of a  
[3:44:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13448) meaningless  
[3:44:10](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13450) utopian ideal that you're never going to  
[3:44:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13452) get in this life so why seek something  
[3:44:14](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13454) which is utopian i you're never going to  
[3:44:16](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13456) achieve  
[3:44:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13457) rather what you need to do you need to  
[3:44:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13459) achieve what your purpose and meaning is  
[3:44:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13461) and really to understand purpose and  
[3:44:23](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13463) meaning  
[3:44:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13464) really contextualizes the problems that  
[3:44:27](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13467) you face and gives you ultimate  
[3:44:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13469) happiness and tranquility within life  
[3:44:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13471) because  
[3:44:32](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13472) that allows you to navigate the  
[3:44:34](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13474) difficulties as well as the happiness  
[3:44:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13476) and the pleasures yeah  
[3:44:38](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13478) so if you don't have that meaning and  
[3:44:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13480) purpose  
[3:44:41](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13481) then and you face difficulties maybe  
[3:44:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13484) disease illness maybe loss of livelihood  
[3:44:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13487) maybe loss of family member loss of  
[3:44:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13489) health all of these types of things if  
[3:44:51](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13491) they affect you and you're trying to say  
[3:44:53](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13493) well my purpose of life is to try to  
[3:44:55](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13495) achieve maximum happiness and you face  
[3:44:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13497) these problems you're like people get  
[3:44:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13499) really depressed whereas if you  
[3:45:01](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13501) understand your purpose especially from  
[3:45:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13502) an islamic paradigm then it becomes very  
[3:45:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13504) easy to understand actually these are  
[3:45:07](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13507) difficulties and tests that are tests  
[3:45:09](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13509) given to me by allah that either  
[3:45:12](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13512) eliminates my sins that raises my ranks  
[3:45:15](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13515) before allah  
[3:45:17](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13517) and therefore there is always a good and  
[3:45:19](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13519) that whatever difficulties i face here  
[3:45:21](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13521) which is will always be temporary but  
[3:45:24](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13524) what will i achieve from those  
[3:45:26](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13526) difficulties will be eternal paradise  
[3:45:29](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13529) real happiness yeah  
[3:45:31](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13531) so i think  
[3:45:33](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13533) um you have to pursue purpose because  
[3:45:36](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13536) purpose defines for us how to view  
[3:45:40](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13540) issues regardless of life whether that's  
[3:45:42](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13542) the ups or the downs because of that  
[3:45:44](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13544) is that okay i idol i i i really like  
[3:45:47](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13547) that because i learned something  
[3:45:49](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13549) new from  
[3:45:50](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13550) zakaria is that how you  
[3:45:52](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13552) say yeah but yeah i'm because like i  
[3:45:56](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13556) usually think that it's just happiness  
[3:45:57](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13557) and pain it's just  
[3:45:59](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13559) or  
[3:46:00](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13560) rather joy and pain it's just part of  
[3:46:02](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13562) searching meaning but he added that it  
[3:46:04](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13564) is also part of meaning  
[3:46:06](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13566) not just like in the searching of it  
[3:46:08](https://youtu.be/g5xh3ZqT8-o?t=13568) which which i really really appreciate
