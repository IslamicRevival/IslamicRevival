The presenter in this video discusses the need for messengers to communicate with a creator. They explain how the nature of a human being is alluded to within the Quran and in debates with atheists. says that even when a person faces a difficult situation, they still maintain hope in the creator.  discusses how humans have an innate desire to seek something more than material to appease something beyond the physical universe, which manifests as a lack of control and fear in difficult situations. It goes on to discuss how this manifests in different ways across different cultures, concluding that it is a universal phenomenon.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2m7jsH3_Mw&t=0)** The presenter discusses the arguments against the existence of a creator, and how these arguments lead to the conclusion that there is a reason for creation. They then go on to explain that, based on the existence of a creator, humans naturally seek guidance from that creator.

[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=14) alhamdulillah you have stayed for  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=17) section four inshallah section four  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=19) we're now going to look at the question  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=21) about the need for messengers and we're  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=23) going to talk about this in two parts  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=25) the first one we're going to talk about  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=27) which is where we're going to focus  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=28) today is the argument from fitra  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=31) so in the first section or the second  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=33) section  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=34) and sections two or sessions two and  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=37) three  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=38) we explored the question of whether the  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=40) universe and all that it contained  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=43) including us  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=44) have a creator  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=46) we explored the various arguments for  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=49) the existence of allah  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=51) and even some of the popular contentions  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=53) against these arguments  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=55) inshallah hopefully we have concluded  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=58) that there are very strong  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=60) rational reasons for not only believing  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=63) that there is a necessary independent  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=65) unlimited creator  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=66) but also a creator who is one and unique  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=70) as well as having a will and thus chose  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=73) to create the universe  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=75) that the first question should now be  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=77) answered what was that first question if  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=78) you remember when we talked about the  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=80) person who wakes up on in a desert  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=83) how did i get here we wake up into  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=85) existence we went from non-existence to  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=87) existence we've answered that first  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=89) question how did i get here  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=92) ultimately without going into the  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=94) discussions of mechanic mechanistics or  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=96) the  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=97) mechanistics or mechanical aspects or  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=99) causations of the universe and its  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=101) creation we ultimately answered the  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=103) question by saying ultimately the  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=105) creator created us  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=107) and brought us into this life  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=110) but we also need to ask the next  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=112) question  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=113) okay we are created  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=115) but we we were we created by the creator  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=117) allah and told just to get on with life  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=120) in essence is there guidance from this  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=123) creator after we have been created  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=126) should we even look for the guidance or  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=128) should we just simply be satisfied that  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=130) allah exists our creator exists that's  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=133) it i'm happy with the answer  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=135) well there's a few ways to answer this  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=136) question  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=137) firstly if we cast our minds back  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=140) to the second video in the first section  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=143) or first session  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=144) we discussed that in order to understand  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=146) our purpose of life  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=148) you know when you wake up in that desert  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=150) in order to understand our purpose we  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=152) need to answer the question how did we  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=154) get here and also  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=156) what's going to happen to us after we  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=158) die  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=159) where are we going and it's only by  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=161) answering this question do we create a  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=163) unique moral and unique viewpoint on  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=167) life so we need to know we still need to  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=169) answer this question  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=171) is there guidance did the creator create  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=173) us and just simply leave us or did the  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=175) creator creators and actually give us a  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=177) guidance that we have to follow and tell  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=179) us what's going to happen to us after we  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=181) die  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=182) so clearly now  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=184) knowing that there is a creator who  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=186) chose to create the universe we'd  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=187) naturally ask the question whether there  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=190) was a reason for this creation and what  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=193) our role is within this universe within  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=195) this creation  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=197) that would necessitate  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=198) us  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=199) force us to go out and look for any  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=202) divine guidance  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=204) that point  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=205) is further emphasized by various people  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=208) claiming that they've received  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=210) communication from the creator so that  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=212) you go outside people are all constantly  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=214) claiming that there is a creator that  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=216) there is so that not only there is a  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=217) creator but they have  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=219) you know  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=220) revelation from this creator the  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=222) guidance to tell us how to live our life  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=224) what to believe in what's going to  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=226) happen to us after we die  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=228) so we'd naturally look at some of these  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=230) claims  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=231) that is something we'd discuss that's  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=233) something we'll discuss more in the next  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=234) session what is the evidences for these  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=236) claims and how to assess it  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=238) secondly by establishing that allah  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=241) exists who chose to create this  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=243) naturally implies there's a purpose  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=246) behind creation because we're not just  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=248) talking about a necessary being that  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=250) incidentally created the universe but  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=252) rather allah subhanallah a creator with  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=255) a will and therefore chose through his  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=258) knowledge and power to create the  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=261) universe that implies that there was a  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=263) reason behind this creation allah he  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=266) mentioned in the quran in translation  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=268) we created not the heavens and the earth  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=270) and all that is in between them for mere  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=272) play sort of  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=274) chapter 21 verse 16.  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=276) so after knowing that the creator  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=278) decided to create us  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=280) it would be natural to ask the question  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=282) why did the creator create us and what  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=284) com you know what guidance is given to  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=287) us therefore we're looking for  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=288) communication  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=290) third reason why we would look for a  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=292) guidance  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=293) is that humans have been created with a  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=295) particular nature  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=297) as we call this the fitra  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=300) which means the innate or as many  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=302) scholars in olympus have said it refers  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=305) to the innate desire or the innate drive  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=308) within human beings to seek worship  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=310) and i want to spend some time explaining  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=312) the fitra of the human being what it  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=315) means and whether it can be rationally  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=318) established that humans have this fitrah  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=321) either this innate desire to worship or  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=324) this instinct to worship allah or the  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=326) creator  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=328) and also or whether this is something  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=330) just simply established from the quran  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=332) and we just assume it and accept it  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=335) this will also add to the other  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=337) evidences that we mentioned why we need  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=340) to  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=340) seek  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=342) a messenger or a message from the  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=344) creator  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=345) i'm going to give you a quick example of  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=346) this is an example from the time of the  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=349) salaf from one of the scholars of the  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=351) son of jafra sadiq  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=354) and it was reported that he had a debate  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=356) or a discussion with an atheist  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=359) and in this debate he was trying to  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=361) explain to the atheist that there is a  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=363) natural innate desire in all human  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=365) beings including him as an atheist to  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=368) believe in a creator and a one god  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=371) and so jafar sadiq he he mentioned this  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=374) point about being on a boat and the boat  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=377) being caught in the storm and the  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=378) atheist said you know what that happened  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=380) to me i was on a boat and we were caught  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=383) in a storm  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=385) and he said when you were caught in a  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=386) storm  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=388) did you  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=389) lose hope or did you maintain hope and  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=391) he said i maintained hope i had hope in  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=392) the ship and the crew to save me from  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=395) this storm  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=396) so then he said well what else happened  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=398) so then the atheist said well then what  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=400) happened was that the ship overturned  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=403) and all the crew fell out and they they  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=405) were into the sea  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=406) and so there was no crew for me to  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=408) depend upon and so jefferson said did  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=411) you  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=413) lose hope or did you maintain hope he  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=414) said i still maintained hope that the  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=416) physical body of the ship would remain  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=418) intact  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=419) but then what happened was that the ship  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=421) began to be destroyed and torn apart and  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=423) so i'm now floating in the middle of the  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=426) ocean holding on to a plank of wood in  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=429) order to stay afloat  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=430) and again japheth sadik said did you  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=433) lose hope or did you maintain hope and  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=435) he said i still had hope that this this  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=438) plank of wood would keep me afloat  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=441) and then he said the atheist he said  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=443) then suddenly the plank of wood  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=445) you know went from beneath me and i was  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=448) no longer supported by the plank of wood  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=450) in the middle of the ocean but i was  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=452) still able to float  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=453) and then jafar sadiq said did you lose  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=456) hope or did you still have hope and he  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=458) said i still had hope and then he said  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=460) upon whom did you place your hope  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=463) because initially it was the crew then  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=465) the ship then the plank of wood and the  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=467) atheist had to admit that his hope was  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=470) placed upon the creator allah  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=475) and so this alludes to the nature within  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=477) a human being this this conversation  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=480) that took place  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=481) and this this nature of the human being  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=483) is also alluded to within the quran  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=485) itself  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=486) allah he says  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=488) in the verse uh sort of unes verse 22 he  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=492) it is who enables you to travel through  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=494) the land and sea to when you are in  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=496) ships and they sail with them with a  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=499) favorable favorable wind and they are  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=501) glad therein and then comes a stormy  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=504) wind and the waves come to them from all  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=507) sides and they think that they are  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=509) encircled therein they invoke allah  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=512) making their faith pure for him alone  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=515) saying if you allah delivers us from  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=517) this we shall be truly grateful  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=520) so allah mentions people upon a ship  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=523) facing a stormy sea and naturally they  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=526) start to invoke upon allah  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=532) and there's a famous saying  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=534) that is mentioned that there are no  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=536) atheists  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=537) on a sinking boat it's a famous saying  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=539) in the uk maybe elsewhere as well but  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=541) there are no atheists on a sinking boat  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=544) and so what we can see is mentioned by  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=546) jafar assad's conversation with the  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=548) atheist or mentioned in the quran itself  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=550) or the saying there are no atheists on a  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=552) sinking boat is that there is a nature  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=555) in a human being  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=556) that when they feel fear they're in a  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=559) difficult situation  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=561) then their natural reaction is to seek  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=564) worship or to seek and needs to sanctify  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=567) to glorify or to connect with the  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=569) creator  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=570) in essence what's happening when a  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=572) person is facing a difficult situation a  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=575) you know facing fear is that they're  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=577) facing a situation in which they feel  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=579) weak limited and needy  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=582) and being feeling this weak limited  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=584) needy nature makes the person realize  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=587) that they don't have control  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=589) over the affairs you know normally we  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=591) have this assumption that you know we're  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=593) in control of what's happening of up  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=596) until something happens that takes away  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=598) that illusion and we realized actually  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=600) the control that we thought we had the  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=602) power that we thought we had easily goes  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=605) away from us maybe we're on a car we're  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=607) driving on the motorway or the highway  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=609) we're thinking we're fine we're safe and  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=611) suddenly we hit a bump and we skid or  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=614) our tire blows out and we're unable to  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=616) maintain control and our heart starts  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=618) pumping  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=619) and maybe after some expletive words you  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=622) start saying you know you start reciting  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=624) the kalima or whatever you know in order  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=625) to uh reconnect it's that natural  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=628) reaction that fear that pushes us  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=631) that lack of control that pushes us to  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=633) want to sanctify  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=635) so we begin to see uh  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=638) so we begin to see that whenever there  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=640) is a situation of you know deep anxiety  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=643) deep problems lack of control that we  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=646) seek out and we call upon allah and i'm  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=648) just going to give a couple of other  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=650) examples of this there's a famous  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=651) footballer or you know he's not that  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=653) famous but he was a footballer his name  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=655) was ander herrera  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=656) and ander herrera before he used to go  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=658) on the football pitch he always used to  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=660) put on his shin pads and the shin pads  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=663) was  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=664) from when he was 13 years of age because  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=667) for him he believed that something  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=668) within the shin pads was able to make  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=671) him play as a better footballer  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=673) so what's going on in his mind it's the  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=675) same thing regardless of the person on  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=676) the sinking ship he's in a situation  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=679) where which he recognizes he lacks  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=681) control  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=682) that there are things that are outside  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=684) of his own factor  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=685) that his own capacity to able to  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=688) determine so as a result he's looking  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=691) for something more than material to  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=693) appease something  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=694) in the same way when you have people  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=696) going into their exams you find people  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=698) will go in there with their lucky charms  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=700) lucky mascots a lucky pen or whatever it  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=703) is that they they're bringing them in  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=706) now the reality is that these things  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=707) don't have any intrinsic materialistic  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=710) value to the exam itself but it's  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=712) because they feel that fear the anxiety  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=716) the lack of control the feeling of being  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=718) weak limited and needy that pushes them  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=722) to look for something more than material  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=724) to appease something that's more than  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=726) material  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=727) and also as a brief example of this  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=731) uh or to extend the point i remember  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=734) also when i was doing my exams or  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=736) with other people students who were  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=738) doing their exams the night before the  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=740) exam the point where you think you know  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=742) what  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=744) you know there's no much more revision i  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=746) can do people become very philosophical  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=748) at that moment in time they start asking  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=750) questions about purpose of life meaning  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=752) isn't there more to life  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=754) it's basically that innate nature nature  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=756) that fitter that's kicking in  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=761) so  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=763) this seems very basic examples  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=765) but this addresses this underlying  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=768) psychology that exists in all human  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=770) beings that human beings have an innate  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=772) desire to seek something more than just  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=775) what we see around us more than the  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=776) physical universe  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=778) and that this manifests mostly or  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=781) becomes most manifest so it's always  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=783) with us we always feel this weak limited  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=785) niche and needy nature but it becomes  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=788) more manifest when we're in situations  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=790) of hardship and difficulty situations  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=792) which are beyond or outside of our  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=794) control this pushes us to seek a higher  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=796) power  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=797) beyond the existence of nature this is  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=800) what we call the sanctification instinct  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=803) the spiritual instinct or what would  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=805) also term as the fitra  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=807) ultimately then the fitra drives us to  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=810) seek out and worship this higher power  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=813) beyond the physical universe  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=815) if this is a major part of the human  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=817) nature to have this  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=819) desire to worship the higher power  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=822) then we'd see this across all cultures  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=824) so if if it actually what we're saying  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=826) exists everybody has this desire to  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=829) worship then it shouldn't just be some  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=832) individuals rather we should see across  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=835) all civilizations all cultures and  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=838) across all times  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=841) and guess what we actually do see this  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=843) we actually observe that every time  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=846) every for every time and for any  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=848) civilization that we have studied we  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=851) observe that there's always something  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=853) that's worshiped some sort of deity or  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=856) even deities that are  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=858) that are worshipped  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=859) you know for example you had the ancient  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=861) egyptians and they would sacrifice  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=864) virgin girls to the nile in order to  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=866) appease the god or gods in order to make  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=868) the now flow  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=870) or some civilizations living next to a  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=873) volcano  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=874) may may have sought to sacrifice or  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=877) appease the gods or or uh direfied the  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=879) volcano in order to prevent the  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=881) eruptions you know for example there's  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=884) examples of you know again  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=887) children being sacrificed on the the  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=889) base of a volcano in order to appease  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=891) the volcano the volcano is a material  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=893) thing but it's the assumption  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=895) that i somehow got something more than  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=897) material that needs to be appeased needs  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=900) to be worshipped needs to be sanctified  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=902) in order to prevent this explosion from  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=905) taking place or the volcano from  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=907) exploding  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=908) so we see that  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=910) across all civilizations and cultures  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=913) religious practices have always been  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=915) seen  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=916) from europe to africa north and south  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=919) america from the far east australasia  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=922) regions  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=923) all of them have had civilizations and  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=926) still have civilizations that continue  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=928) to hold religious practices  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=931) even those civilizations that claim to  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=933) deny the existence of god and existence  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=936) of religions  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=937) have not been able to wipe away the  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=939) spiritual desire within the people for  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=942) example  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=943) soviet union when it was around was  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=946) predicated explicitly on an atheist  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=948) ideology of communism  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=950) and it also tried to ban religious  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=953) practices so it's built upon communism  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=955) and it believed religion was the opium  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=957) of the masses so even in muslim majority  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=960) regions like of soviet union like  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=962) uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan today they  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=964) attempted to ban the quran under  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=967) communist russia  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=968) communi communism they closed the  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=970) massages down and would even check on  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=973) whether people were waking up in the  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=975) middle of the night you know during the  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=977) before fajr time during ramadan to see  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=979) if they have taken their pre-dawn meal  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=981) the sahur  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=983) yet with this attempt to ban religion  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=986) within these countries and its  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=987) expressions muslims still practiced  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=990) their belief there were still  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=991) underground practices of islam in fact  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=994) even in russia when they tried to ban  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=996) the orthodox christian church it was  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=998) impossible and soviet union reinstated  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1002) the orthodox church even though they  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1004) were a communist country back within  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1006) russia  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1007) so even those ideologies like communism  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1010) that seek to deny the nature and even  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1013) those people maybe even consider  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1014) themselves ideologues can never get away  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1017) from the fact that they still believe  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1019) they still desire to satisfy or to seek  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1023) that sanctification  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1024) of their religious instinct or  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1026) religiosity that aspect of their fitter  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1029) so for example in soviet union they  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1032) preserved the body of lenin  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1034) why would you preserve the body of lenin  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1037) for communism  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1038) lenin's dead body is equivalent to a  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1040) rock it's just material why would they  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1043) seek to preserve it more than this they  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1046) would go and visit lenin's body and out  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1048) of respect they would make  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1051) circum you know tawaf around it they  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1053) would go around it like the muslims go  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1055) to make torah around the kaaba they  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1057) would make torah around lenin's body  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1060) so they're doing actions of what worship  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1063) sanctification  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1064) similarly in north korea  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1066) where religious practices are in  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1068) practice or impractically forbidden they  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1071) preserved the body of their former north  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1073) korean leader kim il-sung i know that  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1076) they embalmed his body  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1078) and they put his body in a clear  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1080) sarcophagus sarcophagus was what they  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1082) used to bury people in the in junior  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1084) egyptian society etc and they used to  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1087) bury them because of religious sentiment  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1090) and religious practices and his former  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1093) residents the former leader of north  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1094) korea his former residence was termed a  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1097) mausoleum  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1099) and he is also referred to as the  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1101) eternal leader  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1103) how you know it's amazing not only you  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1105) know are they preserving his body  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1108) showing his body off you know calling  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1110) the place of his uh you know where he's  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1113) buried the mausoleum but they're also  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1115) referring to him as the eternal leader  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1118) this is north korea under communism  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1120) so what is very you know what's very  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1123) clear  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1124) is that even in societies that seeks to  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1127) ban religious expression and religion  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1130) and claims to be predicated upon atheism  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1133) cannot  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1134) and do not actually remove that natural  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1137) instinct their natural fitra within the  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1139) human beings  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1141) so  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1142) not only do we see across all  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1144) civilizations across the planet in all  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1146) various times that demonstrate that  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1149) people are born with the innate desire  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1150) to worship  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1152) but also we have academics that have  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1154) determined that actually this desire to  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1157) worship is something that has been  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1160) empirically observed within human beings  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1162) you know through studies and  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1163) psychological studies and  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1165) anthropological studies  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1166) for example  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1169) professor roger trigg  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1171) who's from the university of oxford said  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1173) and he's talking about the research he  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1175) did about religion across different  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1176) civilizations and culture is it acquired  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1179) from the society or was it innate and he  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1182) said religion was not just something for  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1184) a peculiar few to do on sundays instead  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1187) of playing golf  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1189) we have gathered a body of evidence that  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1191) suggests that religion is a common fact  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1194) of human nature across different  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1197) societies  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1198) this suggests that attempts to suppress  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1201) religion are likely to be short-lived as  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1204) human thought seems to be rooted to  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1206) religious concepts such as existence of  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1209) supernatural aid and agents or gods or  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1212) god  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1213) and the possibility of an afterlife or  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1216) pre-life  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1217) and another  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1219) individual writer graeme lawton who  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1222) himself is an atheist and a writer the  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1224) new scientist he said  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1226) about some various studies that have  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1228) taken place he said they point to they  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1231) point to studies  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1232) showing for example that even people  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1234) claim to and he saw  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1236) before i mentioned the quote he's  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1238) talking about a study that says that  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1240) even atheists are not really atheists  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1243) yeah the atheists themselves implicitly  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1246) still hold on to religious beliefs and  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1248) so he said they point to studies showing  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1252) for example that even people who claim  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1254) to be committed atheists  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1256) tacitly hold religious beliefs such as  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1259) the existence of an immortal soul as an  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1261) example it's like this is implicit  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1264) another academic dr justin barrett a  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1267) senior researcher at the university of  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1269) oxford center for anthropology and the  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1271) mind  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1273) claims that young people have a  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1275) predisposition to believe in a supreme  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1277) being  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1278) because they assume that everything in  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1280) the world is created with a purpose  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1282) like we said it's intuitive to look for  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1285) certain questions of why certain things  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1287) exist and it's intuitive to assume that  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1290) actually the universe was created with a  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1292) purpose with certain laws and therefore  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1295) there must be a law giver who's given it  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1297) laws and therefore a particular purpose  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1300) he states this is dr justin barrett  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1303) the preponderance of scientific evidence  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1305) for the past 10 years or so has shown  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1308) that a lot more seems to be built on  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1311) into the natural development of  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1312) children's minds than we once thought  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1315) including a  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1316) predisposition to see the natural world  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1319) as designed and purposeful and that some  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1323) kind of intelligent being is behind that  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1326) purpose  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1328) now there have been various hypotheses  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1330) put forward in an attempt to explain why  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1332) religious beliefs are innate within  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1334) human beings for example you had dean  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1337) hamer who's claimed that there are genes  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1339) that can code for spirituality and we  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1342) have others that claim that religiosity  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1344) developed as an evolutionary trait in  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1347) order to help with survival  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1349) the point here is this if that the  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1351) creator is the ultimate creator and  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1353) sustainer as well  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1355) of all that exists including then human  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1358) beings then ultimately  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1361) allah created us no matter what the  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1364) mechanism is created us with the innate  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1367) instinct to seek to worship  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1370) therefore the instinct created by allah  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1372) or god in order to push us and drive us  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1374) to worship inevitably means we've  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1377) ultimately been pre-programmed  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1379) with this desire to seek out and worship  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1381) our creator  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1382) seeking out and worship to a higher  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1384) being would inevitably inevitably entail  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1387) a desire to worship the one true creator  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1390) why the one true creator because this is  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1393) a fact that we've established through an  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1394) intellectual process so our mind comes  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1397) to the conclusion that there's one  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1399) creator independent unlimited being  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1403) and therefore we have within ourselves  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1405) this desire to want to worship  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1407) so it naturally fits handing glove that  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1410) the one that we should be worshipping is  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1412) the one true creator who has control  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1414) over all things  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1417) but our question becomes well how do we  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1418) satisfy this worship do we just worship  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1421) the way we want do we submit in any way  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1424) we want and seek the pleasure in the  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1426) creator pleasure for the of the creator  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1429) in what we think that allah wants from  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1431) us  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1433) well no obviously not  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1435) firstly it makes no sense if we have  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1438) this desire to worship in other words a  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1440) desire to submit to the creator to  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1443) sanctify the creator  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1445) then how can we submit  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1448) to the creator's will if we are deciding  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1451) how to submit  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1453) by definition you're not submitting if  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1454) you're making the choice to submit  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1457) so that's naturally submission  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1459) submitting  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1460) secondly how come our minds which are  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1463) limited finite that can't comprehend the  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1466) unlimited and the infinite and beyond  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1468) the universe we cannot comprehend the  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1470) nature of the creator know what will  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1472) please the creator  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1474) so both of these arguments  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1477) necessitate that there must be a  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1480) communication from the creator we are  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1482) created by allah with a desire to  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1485) worship and submit this is the fitter of  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1487) the human being and we've gone through  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1489) various evidences and proofs to  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1490) demonstrate that it's a rational  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1492) observation of the human condition that  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1494) we can prove this so we have this desire  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1496) to worship and submit we can't work out  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1500) how to submit we can't work out how to  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1503) please the creator we don't know what  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1504) pleases the creator what pleases our  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1506) lord allah hence we will have to seek  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1510) out a guidance from the creator it makes  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1512) logical and rational sense that there  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1515) would be a communication therefore that  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1517) we should seek out in order to  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1519) understand how to worship the creator  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1522) and therefore how to fulfill our nature  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1524) the fitra which is the religious  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/z2m7jsH3_Mw?t=1526) instinct or the desire to worship
