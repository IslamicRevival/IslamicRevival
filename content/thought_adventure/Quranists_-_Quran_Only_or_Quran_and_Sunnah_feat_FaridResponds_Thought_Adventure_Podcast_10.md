## Description

A modern movement amongst some Muslims today claim that following anything other than the Quran is “shirk” (associating partners with God) and that following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) is false.

They also attempt to disparage the body of ahadith claiming that these are fabrications of later generations.

In this episode we explore the various arguments including the arguments obligating the following of the sunnah as well as what constitutes the sunnah and the role of the ahadith is establishing the sunnah.

We are pleased also to announce we will be joined by brother Farid from “Farid Responds”.
There will be opportunity for the audience to ring in and ask their questions during the show.

### <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">00:00:00 - 01:00:00</a>

 discusses the differences between Quranists and Sunnahists, and discusses some of the evidence behind following the Sunnah.  discusses the science of hadith, and how like, unlike the Quran, hadith is not a standalone source of religious authority. discusses why it is important to use the Quran to disprove the arguments of people who reject hadith as a source of Islamic authority. They explain that if one does not have access to hadith then they must either reinterpret verses so much that they change their religion, or accept that some of the commands are incomplete and need further explanation.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>**  features Brother Farid Responds to a question about the motivation behind Quran Onlyism. Brother Farid believes that it is a good thing, coming from a good place, that people are rejecting hadith that they dislike. He also believes that the root of the problem is with the narrations themselves and not with the prophet peace be upon him.

- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>** Discusses how he came to believe that the Quran is the only source of guidance for Muslims, and that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) did not have any other revelation. He discusses how he differentiated between those who believe that the Quran and Sunnah are complementary sources of guidance and those who believe that the Sunnah is obsolete and no longer necessary. He also discusses how his view has changed over time and how he now believes that we can benefit from the Sunnah if it is correctly transmitted.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>** Discusses the differences between Quranists and Sunnahists, and discusses some of the evidence behind following the Sunnah.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>** Discusses the science of hadith, and how like, unlike the Quran, hadith is not a standalone source of religious authority. There are verses in the Quran that imply that the sunnah is separate from the Quran, and that is why Sunnah rejecters find the argument that the sunnah is binding evidence convincing.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">00:20:00</a>** Discusses why it is important to use the Quran to disprove the arguments of people who reject hadith as a source of Islamic authority. They explain that if one does not have access to hadith then they must either reinterpret verses so much that they change their religion, or accept that some of the commands are incomplete and need further explanation. goes on to say that when it comes to religious practices, we need to be careful not to take things at face value. We must use the Quran and other sources of information to figure out what allah wants us to do.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">00:25:00</a>** Discusses how, in order to follow the Quran properly, one must also have access to the Sunnah, or teachings of the Prophet. Without the Sunnah, many verses in the Quran can be interpreted in a way that is harsher than necessary.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">00:30:00</a>** Brother Farid discusses the reliability of hadith, which is based on two conditions: the connectivity of the chain of narrators and the reliability of each narrator. He also discusses the issue of contradictions in hadith, and how admin hadith allows for the resolution of those conflicts. Finally, Farid discusses the reliability of the sunnah in general, and how we can verify the accuracy of its teachings through the use of hadith.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">00:35:00</a>** Muslims must use both the Quran and Sunnah to determine the correct wording of a narration, as there are many variants and details to consider. This science is extremely detailed and can only be fully understood by applying it practically.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">00:40:00</a>** The narrator discusses the various ways in which Quranists can approach the issue of whether or not the Quran is preserved. He points out that some Quranists approach the issue with a "blind faith," while others criticize materialistic approaches to religion. He also notes that this type of inconsistency in methodologies is a "negative" approach, and that they aim to be respectful and objective in their criticisms.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">00:45:00</a>** Brother Farid discusses the objections to preserving hadith and responses to them. He mentions the Chinese Whisperer and how it can be used to illustrate the folly of trying to preserve hadith through whispers.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3000')">00:50:00</a>** The presenter discusses some of the common objections that Quranists have to Sunnah, which is based on ignorance of the historical tradition. Jake points out that hadith verification is not something that started 1400 years ago, but actually started with the first three generations of Muslims. Imams Malik and Bukhari had a golden chain of transmission, meaning they were the only ones who could confirm hadith's accuracy.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3300')">00:55:00</a>** Brother Jake adds that the Quran and Sunnah have the same standard of preservation, and that Muslims should not distrust the Quran. There are many evidences for the Quran's authenticity, including geographical, astronomical, and historical evidence.

### <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7200')">01:00:00-02:00:00</a> 
discusses the difference between Quranists and Quran and Sunnah proponents. Quranists believe that the Prophet Muhammad only followed the Quran and nothing else, while the Sunnah proponents believe that the Prophet Muhammad followed the Quran and the Sunnah (his actions and teachings).

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">01:00:00</a>** Brother Farid discusses some famous figures who had children before Imam Malik, including the sons of Hussein. He explains the significance of these figures and their children.

- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3900')">01:05:00</a>** The chain of transmission for the Qur'an is a "golden chain" according to some Muslims, and the Qur'an is sufficient for understanding it on its own. Muslims who believe in following the example of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and following the Sunnah (traditions of the prophet) also believe in following the Qur'an and Sunnah together. The Qur'an explains itself and the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) provides examples of how to apply it. There is wisdom in the way the Qur'an was revealed and in the way it has been preserved over centuries.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4200')">01:10:00</a>** Discusses the concept of clarity in the Quran, and how it differs from how it is understood in other contexts. Brother Sharif points out that the clarity of the Quran is not the same as it was in the first century, and that today's Muslims need to use additional tools in order to properly understand it. Jake adds that the clarity of the Quran also depends on the audience, and that an English speaker might not understand all of it without additional context.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4500')">01:15:00</a>**  a caller asks Jake about why he has remained quite honest with Quranists, despite their illogical arguments. Jake says that he believes in Quran and Sunnah, and that he has spoken to smart Christians who hold onto their beliefs despite the illogicality of them.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4800')">01:20:00</a>** A quranist discusses the different ways in which Sunnah (the Prophet's actions, statements, and physical description) can be transmitted to Muslims. There is legitimate scholarly debate regarding the weight of particular narrations against one another, but nobody disagreed with the fact that Sunnah exists. When a quranist says that they follow Quran only, they are not rejecting Hadith (the Prophet's narrations). However, when they say that they are "hadith rejecters," they are actually rejecting an aspect of Sunnah, which is rejecting hadith.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5100')">01:25:00</a>** , a discussion is had about whether or not Quranists are Sunnis or Shia. Farid Responds says that he is a Quran onlyist, and that Shia hadith sciences are simplified and lack data. Another person, presumably a brother, asks Farid a question, but he is rude and interrupts the discussion.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5400')">01:30:00</a>** Discusses the difference between Quranists and Quran and Sunnah proponents. The Quranist believes that the Prophet Muhammad only followed the Quran and nothing else, while the Sunnah proponent believes that the Prophet Muhammad followed the Quran and the Sunnah (his actions and teachings). It is unclear which position the speaker takes.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5700')">01:35:00</a>** Discusses the concept of quranists following scripture only or scripture and sunnah. He points out that Ibrahim Abraham followed the sunnah, or practices which were not explicitly mentioned in the quran. Jake asks the speaker whether quranists like Ibrahim Abraham come up with their own legislations, such as prayers and the hajj, and the speaker says that he does. He goes on to say that if quranists were to follow scripture only, then they would believe in hadith, or religious traditions passed down through oral tradition.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6000')">01:40:00</a>** Discusses the different meanings of Quranic verses about theft and punishment, highlighting that there is a difference of opinion among Muslims about how to handle these situations. He argues that the science of hadith should be used to help resolve any skepticism about tradition.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6300')">01:45:00</a>** Discusses whether cutting off a thief's hands is prescribed in the Quran or Sunnah. points out that historically, people were often punished with death for theft, and suggests that this is because the Quran and Sunnah do not prescribe cutting off a thief's hands only in cases of extreme theft. He also argues that the current practice of cutting off a thief's hands only in cases of extreme theft is a recent development, and that in the past, thieves were typically punished with amputation of their hands.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6600')">01:50:00</a>** A Muslim scholar discussing the differences between the Quran and the Bible. He says that while there are some differences, the Quran overall upholds the same teachings as the Bible.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6900')">01:55:00</a>** Discusses the different teachings of Islam regarding the law that was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. They note that while the law was revealed in every instance to be the same, different revelations were given to different people at different times and in different nations. The revelation of the Quran is considered the final revelation, and is for the whole of mankind, regardless of color, nation, or tribe. believes in the teachings of Islam and feels that it is the best path for humanity.

### <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10800')">02:00:00</a>

discusses the different ways Quranists can interpret and apply the Quran and Sunnah. Farid Responds discusses the idea that some hadith may conflict with modern science and how a responsible approach to Hadith studies entails accepting hadith as true with an effect that comes from Allah.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7200')">02:00:00</a>** Discusses how some Muslims reject hadith because they find them to be logically inconsistent or contradictory to science. He presents an example of a scenario in which two different approaches to solving a problem can be considered logically contradictory, but points out that this is not always the case with hadith.

- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7500')">02:05:00</a>** Discusses the different ways Quranists can interpret and apply the Quran and Sunnah. Farid Responds discusses the idea that some hadith may conflict with modern science and how a responsible approach to Hadith studies entails accepting hadith as true with an effect that comes from Allah.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7800')">02:10:00</a>**  a Quranist and Sunni Muslim, Farid Responds to a listener's question about whether the hadith can be used to reject modern science. Farid says that while science can be used to reject some aspects of the sunnah, it is not a reliable method to reject hadith as a whole.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8100')">02:15:00</a>** Discusses the different types of authority that can be applied to the Quran, and discusses a hadith in which a boy expresses his concerns that scientific knowledge and medicine may not be revelation from God. Scholars use indicators such as the boy's reaction to the innovation, the context of the hadith, and the overall nature of scripture to determine whether the hadith has revelatory authority.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8400')">02:20:00</a>** Discusses a hadith in which the Quran is said to be incomplete, with a verse apparently missing. argues that this has implications for how we should interpret the Quran, as some verses are more important than others. He also argues that stoning adulterers is permissible under certain circumstances, despite the lack of a specific verse authorizing it.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8700')">02:25:00</a>** Discusses Quranic verses that discuss punishment for thieves, including chopping their hands and feet off.  argues that the punishment is literal and not metaphorical.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9000')">02:30:00</a>** Discusses the verse in the Quran, "Thieves, do not approach," and discusses why it may have been written that way. It states that early on in the tradition of the Quran, there is no evidence that anyone interpreted the verse in the manner that the Muslim philosopher Farid Responds does.  also states that there are various hadith that discuss how the Prophet Muhammad applied this particular verse.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9300')">02:35:00</a>** Discusses a verse in the Quran which states that if someone steals, they have the right to repent and Allah will forgive them. He points out that this is not always the case in today's society, where cutting someone's hand off is considered barbaric. He argues that understanding the original audience's interpretation of a text is important when interpreting it today. He offers an example of Abu Sufyan, an enemy of Islam who lived in a liberal society, and how he would be treated if he were caught stealing in Sweden.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9600')">02:40:00</a>** The caller points out that there is a contradiction between verses in the Quran that condone cutting the hand of a thief, and another verse that says to "spend in the way of allah" by keeping your hand cut. He asks the caller to debate him on this topic on his channel.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9900')">02:45:00</a>** Discusses how some Quranists interpret verses of the Quran to mean that Allah is merciful and therefore would not condone harsh punishments, such as cutting off hands. Abdul argues that this line of reasoning is flawed because it presupposes principles of the Arabic language that are not explicitly stated in the text.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10200')">02:50:00</a>**  Farid discusses the differences between Quranists and Sunnahists, and how Sunnahists may not be following hadith correctly. He also provides an analogy to illustrate his point. Farid requests that brothers be respectful, and recommends that viewers watch his other video on Jake.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10500')">02:55:00</a>** Discusses the importance of understanding the Arabic language in order to properly understand and appreciate the Quran. He notes that while Arabic is an important part of understanding the Quran, it is not required to do so in order to understand its message.

### <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime(03:45:00</a>

, a Sunni Muslim and a Shia Muslim debate over whether or not the Quran should be read alongside the Sunnah. The Sunni Muslim argues that the Quran should be the only source of religious law, while the Shia Muslim argues that the Quran and the Sunnah should be read together.  ends with the Sunni Muslim responding to a viewer question about whether or not he believes that the Quran is the literal word of God.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10800')">03:00:00</a>** Discusses how someone who believes in the Quran only can be an atheist because they don't know if the Quran is preserved.  also discusses how someone who believes in the Quran and Sunnah can't be an atheist because they have an external source of verification.

- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11100')">03:05:00</a>**  Farid explains that there are different recitations of the Quran, each with its own meaning. He says that the one recited correctly is the correct one, and that this can be determined by looking at the context of the verses. Jake interrupts to say that this is a "tautology," and Farid responds by saying that even if a reciter removes all the skill and dots from the lettering, the consonants will still be present.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11400')">03:10:00</a>** Discusses the difference between Quranists and Quran onlyists, and how different readings of the Quran can be accepted or rejected.  also discusses how the Quran's pronunciation is affected by diacritical marks.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11700')">03:15:00</a>**  "Quranists - Quran Only or Quran and Sunnah? feat. @FaridResponds" discusses the difference between Quran only adherents and adherents of Quran and Sunnah. The latter group recognizes that there are different readings of the Quran, and that some verses have been revealed in multiple ways.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('12000')">03:20:00</a>** The Quran is a collection of messages from God that must be clarified in the language of the people, and it can be understood in any language. The verses of the Quran are important for salvation, and believing in allah, belief in the messengership of the prophet, and understanding the basics of belief in quran can be done in any language.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('12300')">03:25:00</a>** The caller asks if accepting hadith is acceptable when there is only one witness, and the panelists say that it is not acceptable because there are certain requirements that must be met in order to establish a law.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('12600')">03:30:00</a>** In this discussion, one of the points brought up is that there is disagreement among Islamic scholars as to whether or not the Quran is muttawater. While some scholars say that it is in a strict sense, others say that it is not in the strict number of chains. The discussion then moves on to discussing the different hadith about muttawater. One of the points brought up is that the sahaba taught thousands of tarbaat in the Quran. If there is agreement among the people reciting it, then there is no need for a chain of transmission to the prophet.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('12900')">03:35:00</a>** The caller asks whether the Quran is sufficient as guidance, and whether we need an external source to understand it. The caller also asks how we know what is truth. The caller says that among the people there is a party who twists their tongues to say that the Quran is from the book when it is not, and that they speak the truth while knowing it to be falsehood. He then says that only after truth comes falsehood will understanding be achieved.

- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('13200')">03:40:00</a>** Discusses different interpretations of the Quran with regards to the punishment for theft, and explains that there is no clear guidance in the Quran on the matter. He goes on to say that followers of the sunnah should follow the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). Finally, the speaker reminds viewers that next week's topic is on consciousness with Hamza sources.
- **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('13500')">03:45:00</a>** features a debate between a Sunni Muslim and a Shia Muslim over whether or not the Quran should be read alongside the Sunnah, or the practices and teachings of Muhammad. Farid, the Sunni Muslim, argues that the Quran should be the only source of religious law, while the Shia Muslim argues that the Quran and the Sunnah should be read together.  ends with Farid responding to a viewer question about whether or not he believes that the Quran is the literal word of God.
