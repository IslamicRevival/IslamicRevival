### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=0) - [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=2100)

 discusses various reasons for why one should believe in Allah, including rational arguments and the similarities between Islam and other religions. It also touches on the possible reasons why Muhammad may have lied or made up stories, and how the Quran is superior to other religious texts.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=0)* Discusses why they believe in Allah, citing various rational arguments. They also mention how Christianity and Judaism share some similarities with the Quran.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=300)** argues that there are many rational ways to believe in Allah, and that this belief is not contingent upon any specific argument. He also argues that, by default, Allah created the human nature to want to worship him.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=600)**  argues that there is only one possible creator, and that this creator must be powerful, knowledgeable, and intelligent.  also argues that the prophet Muhammad (P.S.A.W.) was the messenger appointed by this creator to bring his message to the world. Finally, the video argues that there is no possible way to test the claim of Jesus (J.S.S.) without first testing the claim of Muhammad (P.S.A.W.).
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=900)* Discusses a possible reason why Muhammad may have lied or made up stories over the course of 23 years - to protect himself and his followers from persecution and to maintain their adherence to Islam. Christians assert that Muhammad was deceived by an angel, but this claim is refuted by Jesus' teachings in the Bible. Muslims argue that Muhammad's teachings oppose those of Satan, and that Muhammad was a prophet of God who was opposed by Satan.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=1200)* Discusses the similarities and differences between the Quran and the Bible. It argues that it is more plausible that the Prophet Muhammad copied these books than that he received revelation.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=1500)**  compares the unique genre of the Quran to that of other religious texts, such as the Bible. It points to evidence of an "evident miracle" in the Quran, and argues that this makes it superior to other religious texts.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=1800)* shares reasons why he believes in Allah and how his beliefs compare and contrast with those of other religions. He also touches on the fact that the prophet Muhammad did not live in a palace, and that his enemies were not fooled by his revelations.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdS2lYUATtQ&t=2100)* Discusses why he believes in Islam and how it is the only religion that can truly satisfy a person's mind and soul. Other religions may satisfy a person's whims and desires, but Islam provides guidance for the entire life journey.

[0:00:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=0) hmm uh why do i believe in god because i  
[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2) think it's  
[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=3) obvious it's rational  
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=5) you know there's many different rational  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=8) arguments that justifies belief in the  
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=9) creator so  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=11) yes if you want me to go for a whole  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=13) list of points and positions as to why i  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=16) believe it's rational  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=18) i can do but i think

[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=22) reasonable arguments  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=24) that make it very compelling and  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=26) convincing that a creator exists  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=37) equipment wasn't working my mic was not

[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=65) just personally saying like  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=69) okay  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=71) why do i believe in or whatever why do

[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=74) uh why do i believe in god because i  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=76) think it's  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=77) obvious it's rational  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=79) you know there's many different rational  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=82) arguments that justifies belief in the  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=83) creator so  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=85) yes if you want me to go for a whole  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=87) list of points and  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=89) positions as to why i believe it's  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=91) rational  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=92) i can do but i think uh  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=95) there's a lot of strong rational  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=96) reasonable arguments  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=98) that make it very compelling and  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=100) convincing that a creator exists what  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=103) would be like your strongest point i i  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=106) just like one of you so i i use like i  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=109) use i think what it is is that when you  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=111) whenever you look at any argument or any  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=113) position you want to look at it from all  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=116) different sides so  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=118) we have like various cosmological  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=119) arguments for the existence of god  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=121) transcendental arguments with the  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=122) existence of god you've got the various  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=125) um arguments based upon like how how we  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=129) have this previous information that  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=131) couldn't have arise except through the  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=133) uh through allah giving us the ability  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=135) to have this previous information that's  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=137) a complicated argument but i don't want  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=138) to go down that route at the moment  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=140) you've got arguments about the quran  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=142) about the prophecies about the  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=144) linguistic miracle you've got uh  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=147) evidences from the prophecies from the  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=149) prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=151) wasallam you look at his life you look  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=153) at what he did you look at the impact of  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=154) his message you take all of these  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=156) arguments together and you have a very  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=159) strong and compelling case that there  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=160) exists one creator allah  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=163) and that the prophet muhammad sallallahu  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=165) alaihi wasallam uh is a true prophet  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=168) from allah yeah so it's not just like  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=170) this one argument and that's it  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=174) it's a very simple syllogism  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=176) because as human beings we when we  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=178) investigate things we try to investigate  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=179) it from different angles and different  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=181) uh points of view and then from that we  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=183) get this conviction uncertainty  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=187) right  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=188) um  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=190) another uh question i had about  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=192) islam and like  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=195) what kind of confuses me about it so um  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=199) you know one of the i think like one of  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=201) the gripes that i kind of have is  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=203) how are you sure that like prophet  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=205) muhammed i'm not saying he made it all  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=208) up this is not me saying just like  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=210) theoretically speaking how do you  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=212) how do you know that prophet muhammad  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=214) did not know anything about judaism and  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=217) christianity when a lot of like what is  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=220) said in judaism and christianity  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=222) is in the quran  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=224) okay uh hamza's got a great answer to  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=227) this so i'm gonna but i just before  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=229) hamza jumps in  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=232) is uh  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=234) but i just wanna it's sort of  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=236) when we look at this question about the  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=237) prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=238) wasallam  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=248) i just want to just take a quick step  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=249) back christian christian are you a  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=250) theist you believe in do you believe in  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=252) a creator yeah i do yeah okay then uh  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=256) and you believe that there's good  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=257) reasons to believe in god as well don't  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=258) you yeah i mean the one thing that like  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=261) the reason why i do believe is creator  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=263) is because  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=265) um  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=266) nothing cannot just be something you  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=268) know what i'm saying like yeah  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=270) what what really get like the reason why  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=272) i believe it is  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=273) i think uh  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=274) it was one of the shakes that we're on  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=276) he had a good point i was watching some  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=278) of his stuff and he he had the argument  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=281) like  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=282) you know something has to be created  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=284) from something it can't just be nothing  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=286) you know what i'm saying  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=287) so i think that was where it was like  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=290) i kind of like that's where i kind of  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=292) think i stopped becoming an atheist you  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=294) know  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=295) yeah yeah no no i i i get because what  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=297) it is  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=299) i give this very simple analogy in an  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=301) example i said look imagine if you see  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=302) the painting of the mona lisa  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=305) yeah  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=306) and automatically your first gut  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=308) reaction your first you know uh  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=311) understanding about this painting is  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=313) that there is a painter yes very clear  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=316) very you know  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=318) you know you have a very reasonable  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=319) rational position on that now if i was  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=322) to ask the person well why what's your  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=325) rational thought process of how you come  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=327) to look at the painting and conclude  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=329) that there's a painter he might struggle  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=331) to articulate his rational you know  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=334) thought process but it doesn't make the  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=337) idea less rational  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=339) you know so i think a lot of people out  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=341) there have a rational basis for their  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=342) belief but may not necessarily  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=344) articulate it in like a contingency  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=346) argument or calam cosmological argument  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=348) or a transcendental argument but it but  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=350) if you look at those arguments  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=352) ultimately they boil down to this very  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=354) clear rational reaction that we come to  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=357) when we look around us and say yeah this  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=360) can't really come by chance this can't  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=361) really come by from nothing this can't  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=363) have just always existed there must be  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=365) something independent eternal who  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=368) created the universe out of choice so  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=370) you know that's that's quite clear now  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=373) obviously once we've concluded that then  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=375) then we're saying okay what's  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=377) is there a message that's going to be  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=379) given to us by this creator yeah so you  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=382) know should we expect some sort of  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=384) revelation i don't know what your  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=385) thoughts are about that should we expect  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=388) god to communicate to us or  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=391) you know we just left to it on our own  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=394) are you asking me like  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=396) yeah well you watch your thoughts yeah  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=399) i mean  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=403) i mean that's hard to say because i i i  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=405) don't know like i really don't know what  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=409) this creator his intentions would be  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=411) just to create us and just leave how  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=413) would you know  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=416) i don't know i don't know how there must  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=417) be a way how how could we possibly know  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=419) why the creator created us  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=421) was the only way we could know  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=424) if he told us why  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=426) have you revealed about himself so so we  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=430) have people in history who claim to resp  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=432) to have been revealed  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=433) information revealed to them from the  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=435) creator so we go back now to listen the  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=438) veracity of those claims to see whether  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=440) they're truthful or not now you made a  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=441) claim earlier so you asked the question  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=442) how do you know mohammed i'm just really  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=444) quick so really quickly i want to make  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=446) another quick point  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=448) to add on to this i think we can also  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=451) say not only is it because we know that  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=453) god it can informs us that's how we can  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=455) know but i also think because we are  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=458) created with a nature that wants to  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=460) worship yeah that's something that we  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=462) can all see isn't it it's not something  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=464) that's just simply uh you know we're  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=467) told that some people want to worship  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=469) but actually we see that for all  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=471) cultures and all times it seems to be a  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=473) basic  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=474) you know nature or basic position of the  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=477) human condition that people human beings  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=480) want to worship just like we need to eat  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=482) and drink just like people need to  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=483) procreate there's this innate desire to  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=486) want to worship now christian this is  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=488) where you pick you can put the two  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=490) together  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=491) if we believe that there's a creator  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=493) that exists and we believe therefore the  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=496) this creator created everything  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=498) including the human being then that also  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=500) means  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=501) by default he created the human nature  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=503) to want to worship  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=505) to want and that desire to form a  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=508) relationship or sanctify or revere the  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=511) creator would you not agree christian  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=514) yeah yeah  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=516) so so therefore why would allah or the  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=519) creator give us this desire without  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=522) telling us how to fulfill it properly  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=525) because if we don't  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=527) if we if we're just left with this  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=529) desire wanting to worship we might do  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=531) all crazy stuff like people back in the  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=533) day used to sacrifice virgins to the  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=536) river nile yeah or little kids on the  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=539) side of volcanoes yeah so they think  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=541) they're revering something so  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=544) we as human beings we need guidance  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=547) it's like inbuilt within us to desire  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=550) that relationship we can't form that  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=552) relationship we have to be told how to  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=554) form that relationship from the one who  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=556) created us  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=557) i.e our creator  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=559) you agree  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=561) yes yeah so so now then the question  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=565) becomes uh which is what i think what  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=567) hamza is pushing into  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=568) is okay we've got these candidates now  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=571) yeah you know you've got the candidacies  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=574) of like polytheistic religions you've  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=576) got candidacies of  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=578) uh certain types of anthropomorphic  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=582) morphic type religions you know  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=584) religions which make god into a human  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=586) being or creature then you've got  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=588) religions which are monotheistic now in  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=591) that  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=592) in that  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=593) general broad categorization i would say  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=596) polytheistic religions  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=598) i would throw away  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=599) or not throw away i'd filter out because  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=601) i just don't think you can have more  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=604) than one creator i don't think the  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=605) universe the universe operates in such a  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=608) fine finely tuned system  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=611) that it implies a soul creator and also  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=614) there's some logical problems of having  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=616) two unlimited independent creators  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=620) yeah  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=621) yeah  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=621) yeah so then so then i'm really looking  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=624) for monotheistic religions i'm looking  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=626) for a religion that's that claims to be  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=629) from one soul creator yeah  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=632) so now i'm looking for that one now out  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=634) of that one how many religions would you  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=636) say are  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=638) purely  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=639) monotheistic  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=643) or  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=644) judaism or islam  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=646) right so you got two yeah this the  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=649) second thing that i'd probably look at  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=651) oh the second third or fourth thing that  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=652) i'd look at is okay if i'm going to have  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=655) if there's going to be guidance that's  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=657) going to be sent to the creator  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=659) two human beings would it be just sent  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=661) to a small group of people or would it  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=663) be sent to the whole of mankind  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=669) why would it be  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=671) worse if he sent it to the  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=673) whole mankind just wondering why no no i  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=676) don't think it's worse if it would be i  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=677) think i think that's how it should be i  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=679) think if human beings all human beings  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=681) desire to worship  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=683) you know then i would assume that the  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=686) revelation given to us by god  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=689) would in origin be for all of human  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=691) beings  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=692) how to live our life how to live the  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=694) good life how to worship should be for  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=695) all human beings not for a select group  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=698) yeah yeah yeah okay so  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=701) so that then then i'm thinking well hold  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=703) on judaism  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=704) isn't really for everybody jews  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=707) themselves say no this is  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=709) specific religious practices only for  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=711) our group  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=712) yeah  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=713) whereas islam says  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=715) no  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=716) this is a revelation that's given for  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=718) all of mankind as a mercy for them and  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=721) as a way for them to  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=722) seek their relationship with allah with  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=725) their lord  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=727) yeah so  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=728) so now so now i've really narrowed it  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=731) down to a position of one  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=733) yeah  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=734) so so the next maybe some issues related  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=737) to the issues of okay how can i justify  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=739) that one religion i islam maybe a  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=742) contention that you have  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=744) is the one about well could the prophet  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=746) muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam just  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=749) have copied the bible  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=751) uh or the torah or the injil or things  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=754) like that  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=755) and developed their own you know their  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=758) own monotheistic religion which seems to  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=761) perfectly accord  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=763) to what we would what is within our  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=765) nature as human beings and also seems to  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=769) have  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=770) you know  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=771) removed all the problematic aspects of  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=774) those other religions like trinitarian  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=776) christianity  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=777) or the selective  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=780) you know uh revelation only given to a  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=782) select group of people like in judaism  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=785) yeah yeah  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=786) hamza i don't know if you want to take  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=787) it from there i've set him up for you  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=790) thank you  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=791) okay so what you're basically saying

[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=796) i've seen yeah i i'm not saying he did  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=799) but like i'm just saying theoretically  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=802) that could be the possibility you know  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=803) what i'm saying  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=805) four possibilities yeah are you a

[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=821) contradictions in it and i just don't  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=823) there's no way i could really believe in  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=824) it to be honest yeah that was my  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=826) sentiment to be honest with you  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=828) um going back to your original question  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=830) sorry i'll come to this point you asked  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=832) why i believe in god or why believe in a  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=833) god yeah because i never used to i've  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=835) just been an atheist yeah yeah uh i  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=837) don't believe this universe could exist  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=838) without a creator standard  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=840) yeah that's my evidence prove god the  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=842) universe  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=844) prove god creation for me  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=846) as a star pretend  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=848) all right  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=850) just as i can exist without a mother i  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=852) don't think the universe could exist  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=853) without a creator  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=854) necessary you forget what the other kids  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=855) were saying necessary something  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=856) necessary created everything this  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=858) necessary being must be powerful  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=860) knowledgeable intelligent have a will  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=862) and and then we see people claiming to  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=864) be messages of this creator so i test  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=866) the veracity of the claim and hear where  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=867) we are because there's no probably  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=868) testing the claim of jesus when jesus  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=870) never came to me yeah i'm an englishman  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=872) jesus didn't come for me jesus came to  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=873) the jews no from testing the claim of  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=876) moses moses went to the children of  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=878) israel they come to me abraham went to  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=880) his people no one to his people only one  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=882) messenger in history ever claimed to  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=883) come to the whole world and that was  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=884) mohammed peace and blessed me upon him  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=886) so it's like that's the messenger i need  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=888) to test because no other messenger came  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=889) to me yeah yeah so that that's how i  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=892) narrow it down if i'm looking for a  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=894) message from the creator and only one  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=895) messenger ever claimed to come for me  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=897) let's test his claim  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=898) so he claimed that there's a 1400 years  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=900) ago an angel came to him told him he's a  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=902) messenger of god to the people and he's  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=903) to go down to the pagans and tell him to  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=904) stop worshiping idols and worship the  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=906) one god of abraham yeah that's what he  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=908) was told to do so there's four  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=910) possibilities one he's crazy delusional  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=913) visions of angels thinking he's seeing  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=914) angels telling him what to do and in  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=915) fact it's all in his head yeah one  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=917) option option number two he's deceived  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=920) this is a christian claim that he's  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=921) deceived a demon pretending to be an  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=923) angel to fool him into believing he's  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=924) the messenger of god but in fact he's a  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=925) messenger of the devil and the quran is  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=927) from the devil and islam is from the  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=928) devil  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=929) that's option number two yeah after the  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=931) question number three he's lying making  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=932) it all up yeah he's pretending an angel  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=935) came to him there was no angel he's gone  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=937) down pretending acting like he's a  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=939) prophet claiming prophethood trying to  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=941) get people to follow him and such and  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=942) such yeah  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=944) and over 23 years he invented the quran  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=946) and claimed it was from god  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=948) yeah or four he's telling the truth an  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=950) angel comes from the cave he's a  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=951) messenger of god and that's how  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=953) yeah so  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=954) these are four options broken down yeah  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=957) hold on  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=959) we can easily dismiss the crazy claim  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=960) because this is a revelation over 23  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=962) years this is not just like something  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=963) that happened like one guy came out the  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=965) cave and that's it because people seem  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=966) to think that he had just one visitation  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=968) in a cave and that was the whole of  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=970) islam no 23 years he received visitation  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=972) there was witnesses to when he received  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=973) the revelation they could see his  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=975) demeanor change you could see the sweat  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=977) and the you could see the camel take the  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=979) weight when he was receiving revelation  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=981) yeah so there's witnesses to him  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=982) receiving revelation that's the first  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=984) thing but anyway so how is it so really  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=986) quick i think christian wants to ask a  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=988) question on what you did  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=990) sorry okay okay okay this is what i want  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=993) to ask so why do you specifically not  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=996) believe it's devil right i'm not saying  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=998) this  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=999) i'm not specifically i'm not saying it  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1001) is or whatever you believe  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1004) okay  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1005) you know what i'm saying like why didn't  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1006) you believe it you know okay the only  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1008) people who make this claim are  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1009) christians yeah  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1011) and the bible says jesus jesus can't do  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1012) jesus says in the bible the devil can't  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1014) do what the christians claiming happened  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1018) like talking having revelations no that  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1021) no satan cannot stand against himself a  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1022) house is divided cannot stand because  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1024) jesus was accused of the same thing the  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1026) jews came to him and said  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1027) when he was when he was casting out  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1029) demons he said oh this is beasley bug uh  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1031) expelling uh demons basically it's a  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1033) it's a charade it's a devil pretending  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1036) to expel demons to create this idea and  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1038) jesus turned to them and said uh satan  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1041) cannot status oppose himself state satan  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1043) kind of stand against himself a house  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1044) that is divided cannot stand so they  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1047) understood what he meant so jesus says  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1048) in the bible because he's only  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1049) christians to make this claim satan  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1051) cannot oppose himself when you read the  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1053) quran it completely opposes satan curses  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1055) satan until you seek refuge from satan  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1058) why would satan want you to know he  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1059) exists when he's your sworn enemy why  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1062) would satan want pagan arabs to start  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1064) worshiping god why would sage satan want  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1067) the people to stop doing all the  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1068) debauchery  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1069) and and be civil and kind and and why i  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1072) would say to want these things he wants  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1073) chaos why would he want this why we  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1075) don't want people knowing about the god  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1076) of abraham and to worship the god of  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1078) abraham it didn't make no sense  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1079) whatsoever so the claim is refuted by  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1081) jesus in the bible and it's only  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1083) christians that make this claim anyway  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1084) and that doesn't stack up when you look  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1086) at the teachings of islam it's not  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1087) teaching that's teaching complete  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1088) opposite of what satan would represent  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1091) right now okay yeah all right i i  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1094) believe you when it says okay yeah that  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1096) i agree with you yeah  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1098) yeah  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1099) look it comes down to two things he's  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1101) ever lying or telling the truth  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1103) right  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1105) so then we'd look at the character why  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1106) would he lie was he a known liar was he  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1109) somebody who who usually made up stories  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1111) did he have something to gain by this  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1113) lie did he benefit from this lie  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1116) the only the only thing i could say  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1119) maybe he did benefit from  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1121) is being maybe he was like a type person  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1124) that wanted to be me uh wanted to be  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1126) like  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1127) not working not working but  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1130) he wanted me throughout the years like  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1132) throughout the centuries or whatever  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1133) like that's the only thing i could think  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1135) of he wanted to be famous yeah to be  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1138) like seen as this messiah figure things  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1140) like that yeah  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1141) but you have to understand christian is  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1143) that for the first 13 years the prophet  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1145) peace be upon him who is in mecca was  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1147) facing persecution facing torture uh  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1150) he was his followers were facing torture  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1153) his followers were killed yeah he's he's  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1156) he's  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1157) so  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1158) in that situation and and also the other  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1160) thing is this what's really interesting  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1161) christian is that they tried to buy off  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1164) the prophet peace be upon him they they  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1166) there's a narration in which they came  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1168) to the prophet peace be upon him and  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1170) they basically offered him numerous  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1172) things they offered him to become the  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1173) richest person amongst them they offered  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1175) him to be a uh  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1178) um a leader amongst themselves yeah so  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1181) long as they didn't you know you know  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1183) allowed them to commit their idolatry  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1186) they offered him women yeah  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1188) so  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1189) there was even and he they so they  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1191) offered him various things and he  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1193) basically said look and this is a time  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1195) where he there he's him and his  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1196) followers are being persecuted he was  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1198) boycotted  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1200) for three years a starvation that you  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1203) know  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1203) uh his own family members like his wife  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1206) died as a result of it yeah he you know  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1209) he was though  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1210) they were in a very very difficult  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1212) situation and yet these were types of  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1214) incentives that were being given to the  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1216) prophet peace be upon him yeah so um  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1220) there was even an incident in which  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1222) which  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1223) was a reason for the revelation of  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1224) surutil kaffiron  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1226) which is a basically a  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1228) criticism of the of the disbelievers  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1231) where they said we will worship your  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1233) lord for one year  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1235) so long as we can then worship our lord  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1237) for another year and we'll let the  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1238) people decide yeah so so the the pagan  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1242) arabs were and the leaders of the pagan  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1243) arabs were so like  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1245) um any threatened by the message  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1248) of the prophet peace be upon him they  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1249) were literally trying to do compromise  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1252) upon islam and then god sends down the  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1254) revelation says oh you disbelieve never  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1256) will we worship what you worship and  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1258) never you will worship what um  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1261) never you will worship what we worship  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1262) and we will not worship what you worship  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1264) and then it goes on and it says and to  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1266) use your deen and to use your religion  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1268) and to us is our religion so there's  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1271) very clearly  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1273) a a problem with the narrative to say  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1276) that this was a person who was about  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1278) himself in his ego  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1280) when he could have been the leader of  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1282) mecca  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1283) a lot easier and a lot quicker than  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1286) facing the torture and the persecution  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1288) that he faced yeah  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1291) so so i i don't think that makes sense  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1293) and going back to that point  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1295) specifically before i think hamza wants  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1297) to also make more points as well than  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1299) this but just going back to that point  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1300) about could he have copied  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1303) you have to think about what it would  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1305) mean to be a person who could  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1308) literally create a new religion  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1310) face the difficulties and the  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1312) persecutions  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1313) face you know his followers being  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1316) tortured and killed face a boycott being  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1319) stoned out of a town where he's bleeding  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1322) and blood soaks to his sandals having to  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1325) face armies that are coming against him  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1327) to try to wipe out  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1329) you know the nascent islamic society of  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1332) medina at that time because later on he  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1334) moved to a place called medina or  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1336) so all of these situations he's facing  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1339) and at the same time he's meant to be a  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1341) master of the knowledge of the torah  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1344) yeah he's meant to have in-depth  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1346) knowledge of trinitarian beliefs because  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1348) it's the quran doesn't just criticize  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1350) one form of trinitarian belief it can it  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1352) criticized many forms of trinitarian  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1354) beliefs yeah he would have had to  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1356) understood you know some of the  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1359) you know early  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1361) historical evidences and knowledge that  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1363) had actually not existed for a long  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1365) period of time during time of his during  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1367) time the prophet muhammad peace be upon  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1368) him like the egyptian civilization  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1371) you know it's hard enough for me to do  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1373) something  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1374) you know to go you know with the  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1376) internet with the bible growing up in in  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1379) in you know in a christian society or  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1381) predominantly more christians in this in  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1383) the society that i live in to do to go  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1386) and look at the details of the stories  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1388) that are found within the bible for me  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1390) to do that now you add to the fact that  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1393) the prophet peace be upon him  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1395) was could not read or write  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1398) and there wasn't the available resources  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1401) of books in arabic language either  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1404) translation of the torah there wasn't a  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1406) translation of the new testament  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1408) into the arabic language  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1410) so  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1411) it comes to a situation where you're  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1412) thinking hold on  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1414) it seems more ridiculous to say that the  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1417) prophet peace be upon him copied these  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1419) books  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1421) than it does  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1422) that any he was receiving revelation  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1424) which is a bold claim but it seems more  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1427) plausible that he was receiving  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1428) revelation and then the final point  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1431) which is i think really sort of uh kills  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1433) the point as well is  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1436) the quran yes has certain um  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1438) similarities with the previous  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1440) scriptures which is natural because we  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1442) believe this previous scriptures had  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1443) original revelation they were originally  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1445) revealed so there's going to be some  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1447) overlap and some sort of concordance  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1449) between the two if there wasn't any  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1450) concordance i would actually have more  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1452) problems with that yeah because i'm  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1453) thinking hold on  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1455) the torah and the injil were originally  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1457) revealed by god to the prophets so you  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1460) know there should be similar stories in  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1462) this but what's really interesting is  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1464) where it departs as well so for example  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1468) you find a lot of the stories of the  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1470) prophets in the old testament or the  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1472) torah  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1473) really uh denigrating the prophets  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1477) like a lot ha i think it was he drunk  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1480) and then he had sex with his daughters  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1482) and had babies  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1483) yeah and david uh you know basically had  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1486) an adulterous affair and killed off the  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1488) husband so he could marry his wife  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1490) things like that um there's lots of this  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1493) type of stuff now you look at the quran  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1495) actually the quran says the complete  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1497) opposite it always mentions these people  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1500) as being righteous pious god fearing  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1502) people  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1503) and it mentions the story but always  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1506) omits any of these derogatory remarks  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1509) that are being made against the prophets  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1511) and that's because we believe that  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1512) obviously the previous scriptures  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1515) were corrupted over a period of of time  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1517) and and some of these um you know  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1520) false stories and accusations against  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1522) the prophets were inserted so  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1525) so the quran is actually directly and  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1528) indirectly dealing with the  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1530) misinformation that was being presented  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1533) by those people the scribes who had  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1536) written down the torah but inserted as  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1538) an incorrect things it's dealing with  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1541) that you know indirectly and directly  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1544) and the other thing is this is that if  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1546) you're going to try and win quote  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1547) unquote the christians over to your  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1549) message and you're trying to copy the  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1552) christian message and the copy of the  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1553) jesus  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1555) why would it deny crucifixion  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1557) yeah if you're saying okay they want to  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1559) say monotheism they don't want to affirm  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1561) that jesus is the son of god  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1565) then okay fine you can say he died on  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1567) the cross but he was a prophet why deny  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1569) crucifixion that's so central to the  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1572) christian story story about god dying  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1575) for the sins yeah so he denies that yeah  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1579) so you know you're not going to gain  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1580) anything from that you're actually going  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1581) to create more antagonism to the  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1584) community that you're supposedly trying  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1586) to win over by copying their books so  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1589) you look at the details of the stories  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1591) you find that the details of the stories  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1593) there is concordance but there's also  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1595) divergence and where the divergence are  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1597) very interesting because they put they  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1599) present a clearer narrative and  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1602) demonstrate how it's trying to correct  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1604) the previous scripture as opposed to  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1607) pander to it or pander to the people who  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1610) follow those previous scriptures right  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1613) okay one last question this is my last  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1615) question so  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1618) what makes what would you say like what  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1620) would make mormonism like wrong like in  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1622) a sense like  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1623) why would he not be another prophet you  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1626) know what i'm saying  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1627) joseph  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1628) yeah yeah i'm just i know it's kind of a  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1630) stupid question like well so yeah what  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1633) would you say like that  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1635) religion that that's a false prophet  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1637) right well look we quite frank joseph  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1639) smith didn't he get convicted for fraud  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1642) before he even claimed i don't even know  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1644) i don't even know yeah he did he got  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1645) convicted for fraud secondly is that the  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1647) prophet peace be upon him you know he  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1650) didn't just he didn't just come and have  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1652) all of what we've just said  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1654) yeah this this religion that accords to  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1657) monotheism that is in accordance to  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1658) human nature that talks about previous  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1661) scriptures that corrects the previous  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1662) scriptures  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1664) they had all of that but also  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1666) what he also had was he had an evident  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1669) miracle which was the quran yeah and  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1671) that's a really long discussion but we  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1673) believe there's an objective  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1675) uh sign given to the people of of of the  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1679) arabs at the time the prophet peace be  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1680) upon him which can also be sensed today  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1683) which was the linguistic miracle of the  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1686) quran yeah so this you know the fact  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1689) that it's inimitable is beyond human  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1692) productive capacity yeah this is this is  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1694) what we mean so just as a very brief  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1697) point in arabic language you have like  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1700) uh poetry and you have prose uh poetry  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1704) was broken up into 16 different forms of  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1706) meter known as al-bihar and prose was  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1709) broken into two  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1711) forms sajar and morsel  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1714) and what you find is that the quran as a  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1717) literary piece doesn't fit into any of  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1719) the 16 different meters of poetry nor  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1722) does it fit into any of the two  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1723) different forms of prose it's a unique  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1725) genre in itself and one of the key  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1728) challenges was to produce something  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1730) similar to the quran which fits its  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1733) genre and also fits something else  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1736) called balaga which is to do with  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1738) rhetoric and meaning how to construct  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1740) something as meaningfully uh  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1743) comprehensive but as concise as the  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1746) quran and so  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1747) what you found is that the arabs at the  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1749) time of prophet peace be upon him they  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1751) were the best of the arab arabic  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1752) language they had greatest knowledge of  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1754) poetry and prose and how to construct  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1756) language and all these types of things  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1758) so they were challenged by this miracle  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1760) and so it was an evident miracle and  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1762) that challenge is open today and the  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1764) challenges is you know on the facebook  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1766) it seems quite simple if you don't  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1768) believe it's from god produce free  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1770) produce a chapter like the quran and the  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1772) shortest chapter of the quran is three  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1774) verses long 17 words  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1776) so really you just have to produce 17  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1778) words  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1779) of a similar genre and also of the  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1782) similar meaning yeah as the quran  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1785) produces and people have failed to have  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1787) done that and that's why many  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1789) non-muslims as well as muslim arab  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1791) experts have testified that the quran is  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1794) considered the highest form of speech  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1795) and nobody's been able to imitate it now  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1798) you compare that to and that by the way  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1800) you've also got prophecies in the quran  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1802) which came true during the lifetime of  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1803) the prophet and afterwards and  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1805) prophecies that the prophet peace be  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1806) probably mentioned in hadith which are  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1808) very specific as well and that i've also  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1810) come through  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1811) but also  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1812) just comparing it back to mormonism  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1815) joseph smith he talked about  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1817) an infinite number of gods  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1819) yeah he talked about the fact that  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1822) jesus and the devil were both  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1825) brothers and they they were and the god  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1828) the father was the the main you know had  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1830) basically fathered these children and  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1833) that this god father  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1835) a product of a previous  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1838) universe which was created by another uh  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1841) god and that we but after we die we can  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1843) become gods as well and create our own  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1845) universes you know so  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1848) it is a polytheistic belief system  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1851) uh  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1852) that you know does not seem to um  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1856) accord what we would rationally come to  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1858) when it comes to the idea that there is  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1859) one  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1860) absolute supreme creator  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1863) that doesn't live on a planet called  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1865) kolob which they also believe  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1869) my biggest criticism sorry of joseph  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1871) smith is  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1872) the idea that he found these gold plates  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1874) that only he could read  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1877) but if only he could read them how did  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1878) anybody know that he could read them  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1881) i just don't get it  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1884) he could say yeah i could read it no one  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1886) else can i can read it though and here's  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1887) what it means  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1888) and basically the so you know one of the  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1891) things is if you look at the book of  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1892) mormon and the kgb bible there's so many  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1894) similarities that people believe that  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1895) the kjv was the source for it  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1897) and if you could demonstrate the kt verb  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1899) kgb bible is corrupt in essence then  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1902) what's the point of interpreting a  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1903) corrupt book so for me and also um  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1908) what we believe as muslims is that the  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1909) religion was completed  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1910) there's nothing extra to add there's  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1912) nothing that you need to  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1914) that any other messenger you could come  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1916) after muhammad sawsan to add to the  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1917) religion because it was complete it was  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1919) perfected and so if something's  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1921) perfected and complete and the process  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1922) of the seal of the prophets then there  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1924) is no more coming after him  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1926) where did he go  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1930) i think you're gonna be lost connection  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1932) he might come back  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1934) if i'm gonna go through  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1936) well  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1937) beautiful you you flex then bro you flex  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1942) see i'm not just one trick pony i'm just  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1947) you got the northern accent there i mean  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1948) yeah  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1949) honestly honestly uh yeah so uh  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1952) christian so uh that's what i reject  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1954) joseph  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1956) and even going back to something that  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1957) sheriff said earlier is you know when  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1960) when the person was receiving this  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1961) revelation  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1963) remember he's an electric man he's  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1964) speaking out against the people of mecca  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1967) yeah  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1968) questioning the the what they do and the  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1970) worshiping of the idols i remember one  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1971) thing mecca was a city that  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1973) made money from doing trade with  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1975) pilgrims  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1976) who came to the kaaba to worship their  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1978) gods so  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1980) there were merchants it was a merchant  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1981) city so that's how they made their doll  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1983) and you're now telling them to stop  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1984) worshiping these idols i just worship  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1986) the god of abraham and they mocked and  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1988) they said if we got rid of all the idols  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1990) who would come to makkah who would come  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1992) to worship and subhanallah  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1994) we just look at  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1996) hajj and umrah um in today's day and age  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=1998) but anyway so when the prophet saws they  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2000) knew he they knew he was they knew him  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2001) since he was a boy yeah they knew that  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2003) he couldn't read all right he was  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2004) unlettered and all of a sudden they're  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2006) hearing him with this amazing arabic  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2009) and and they send their poets and they  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2011) say listen go go to him and find out  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2013) where he's getting this from so his  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2015) enemies are saying go to him and listen  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2017) and you you tell us what the source of  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2019) his stuff is  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2020) they came back and they said  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2022) this is sorcery  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2024) they might imagine  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2026) they're sent to listen to the quran they  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2027) hear the quran being recited and they  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2029) come back saying this is something else  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2031) this is not just poetry this is beyond  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2032) it  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2033) forget me  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2034) so  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2035) it's like shiny said it's not just one  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2037) thing it's a multitude of things and  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2039) even there was a time when the when the  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2040) prophet saw some baby boy died  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2043) i think it was ibrahim and there was an  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2045) eclipse  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2046) and the people were pointing saying look  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2048) you know the moon's kind of respecting  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2050) you know your babies died yeah  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2053) and and if he was a charlatan if he was  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2055) doing trying to make a charade if he was  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2057) doing a joseph smith  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2059) he'd say yeah you see i am the messiah  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2061) yeah you take advantage of this natural  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2064) occurrence yeah but he didn't he  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2066) dismissed it he said this is just the  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2067) moon  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2068) it's got nothing to do with me  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2070) so he did the opposite what you'd expect  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2071) a charlatan to do right also he didn't  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2074) live in a palace  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2075) he didn't walk around in the finest  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2077) clothes eating and drinking the greatest  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2079) of food and feasting  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2081) you know when dignities came to visit  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2083) him they didn't know who he was they  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2084) didn't know where he was they know who  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2085) was the leader  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2087) he didn't have a standing guard in that  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2088) sense  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2090) you know so  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2091) if someone's doing things for fame you'd  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2093) expect to see statues everywhere if  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2095) you're doing it for money you you want  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2097) to see the wealth  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2099) we can see this  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2101) so you have to question why is he doing  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2103) this  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2104) how is he it's not just why is he doing  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2106) this how is he doing this  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2108) you know sharif mentioned about there  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2110) was no you know the arabian old  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2111) testament old testament i think appeared  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2113) in the 10th century in arabia in arabic  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2115) yeah and you know you might have bibles  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2118) around today but back then it was all in  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2119) monasteries and big scrolls and there  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2122) was nothing going on in people's back  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2123) pocket do you know what i mean so the  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2126) idea any you know to to have under  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2128) because some of the stories in the quran  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2130) come from the apocrypha book so this  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2132) that when i say don't we copy from them  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2134) but new of them  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2136) knew of the events that occurred the  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2138) gospel of thomas isn't it as well yeah  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2140) infancy gospel of thomas yeah the baby  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2142) speaking as a baby play  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2144) blowing the into the bird the clay bird  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2146) and many different things and not just  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2148) that the oral traditions of the jews  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2152) relays  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2154) so the idea that he an unlettered man in  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2158) pagan arabia somehow  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2160) managed to know the  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2163) old new testament apocalypse books or  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2165) traditions of jews regurgitate them in  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2167) his mind over a period of 23 years and  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2169) reveal them piecemeal  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2172) is absolutely impossible in in a  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2174) linguistic style that was inimitable by  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2176) the by the arrows  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2179) and then this message that was revealed  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2181) over 23 years has been preserved to this  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2182) day  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2184) subhanallah and it just so happens  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2186) everything that islam teaches as a  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2188) guidance benefits mankind in a way that  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2190) nothing else can  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2192) and i say this to you christian if  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2194) you're a theist if you believe in god no  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2196) religion is going to satisfy your mind  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2197) and soul like islam does  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2199) no religion can do it  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2201) right there are many religions that will  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2202) satisfy your soul  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2204) your whims and desires  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2206) but it's not going to satisfy your mind  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2209) only islam can do that nothing nothing  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/jdS2lYUATtQ?t=2210) else can
