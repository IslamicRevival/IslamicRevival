### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=0) - [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=1200)

 discusses how atheism lacks the ability to determine whether something or someone's actions are good or evil. It goes on to say that from a religious perspective, good and evil are determined by an individual's viewpoint.  concludes by saying that belief in a creator can help people be emotionally stable and have a sense of tranquility.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=0)** The "Problem of Evil" is an argument used by atheists against the existence of a God. The argument is based on the idea that if an all-powerful and all-good God existed, evil would not exist. While there are weaknesses in the argument, it is nonetheless a popular one.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=300)**  the atheist problem of evil is discussed.  points out that evil does not necessarily have to be bad, and that it can have a greater good as a result. The example of a doctor curing a patient through the use of side effects is given. From an atheistic perspective, it is difficult to determine whether something is evil or not. The problems with this worldview are then illustrated with examples of things that are considered bad, but which have a greater good as a result. Finally, the difficulties of making moral judgments against natural disasters are discussed.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=600)**  atheist professor Douglas Groothuis explains how materialistic worldviews lack the ability to determine whether something or someone's actions are good or evil. He goes on to say that from a religious perspective, good and evil are determined by an individual's viewpoint.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=900)** The Problem of Evil argument fails on a number of grounds, firstly it reduces the attributes of the creator to simply all good and all-powerful. Secondly, good and bad are arbitrary terms, we apply them from our viewpoint on life for a person following the capitalist ideology of maximizing benefit minimizing pain, but from the viewpoint of a muslim, life is a test a test whether we fulfill the commandments of allah or do we disobey the commandments of allah. Finally, belief in the creator gives us psychological and emotional stabilizers that allow us to overcome difficulties.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6GSwEvkRg&t=1200)* Discusses the problem of evil, and how belief in a creator can help people be emotionally stable and have a sense of tranquility. Atheism does not have the same effects, as it does not provide a sense of tranquility or stability in the hearts of people.
