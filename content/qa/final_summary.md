### [What is the meaning of "Injil" in the Quran?](#translation-meaning-2)
The speaker discusses the meaning of "Injil" (Gospel) in the Quran, drawing from a video where an American academician disagrees with Muhammad Assad's interpretation of the word. The speaker highlights that in general usage, "Injil" refers to the revelation of the prophets, while "Hikmah" (wisdom) refers to the knowledge of Allah in the supernatural realm. He further explains that the Jews used the term "Taurat" for the teachings given to Moses, which went beyond the tablets and included the revelation of the tablets themselves.

The speaker presents two translations of Maryam's words when she questioned how she could have a child as a virgin.

The speaker acknowledges that translations can sometimes be inaccurate, influenced by pre-existing assumptions and biases.

### [Are there potential inaccuracies in Muhammad Assad's translation of the Quran?](#translation-meaning-7)
The speaker suggests that Muhammad Assad's translation of the Quran might be influenced by his own biases and interpretations.
