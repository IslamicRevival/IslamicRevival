[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=5) know throw dust in your face but i have  
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=6) to admit your channel is probably the  
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=9) most  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=10) mature  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=12) intellectual spiritually vibrant channel

[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=21) channels i do promote it often on  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=22) twitter and i just have to say that it's  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=25) an inspiration like you're an

[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/xv32S5e-AUI?t=32) because besides because of guests like
