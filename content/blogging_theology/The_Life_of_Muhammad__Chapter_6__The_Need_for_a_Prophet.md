### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkH4c8AEBQo&t=0) - [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkH4c8AEBQo&t=900)

 the story is told of how Muhammad met a woman named Kuttalaya, who told him that the light had left him and he could no longer fulfill the need she had of him. This event was later remembered as the year of the elephant, which was a significant year for more than one reason.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkH4c8AEBQo&t=0)** This chapter tells the story of how Muttalib, a pious Arab, rejected the idol worship of his tribe, and how this angered his ancestors. Eventually, Muttalib's faith in God led to him being chosen as the prophet of God, and he was given the responsibility of leading the Arabs in prayer and worship. Quraish were jealous of Muttalib's position, and they plotted to overthrow him. However, God protected Muttalib and he was able to remain undefeated. Eventually, Muttalib passed away and was buried near the Kaaba.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkH4c8AEBQo&t=300)** The orthodox Meccans looked on idols as a pollution and refused to compromise, relegating the Muslims to the fringe of society. Waraka, one of the Hunafa, was a christian and believed that a prophet was imminent. His clan was prepared to protect him, and many of the predicted signs of the prophet's coming had already been fulfilled. The Muslims stood in need of a prophet even more than the Jews, who at least still followed the religion of Abraham. The Christians waraka amongst them had their doubts about this, seeing no reason why he should not be an Arab. The other pagan tribes were hostile to Christianity, but the Croats, other pagan tribes, were not. Christians sometimes came to do honor to the sanctuary of Abraham, and were made welcome like all the rest. Moreover, one Christian had been allowed and even encouraged to paint an icon of the Virgin Mary and the Child Christ on an inside wall of the Kaaba. However, Croats were more insensitive to this contrast, for them it was simply a question of increasing the multitude of idols by another two. This tolerance made them so impenetrable to most of his tribe that waraka could read and have made a study of the scriptures and of theology.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkH4c8AEBQo&t=600)** Abd al-Muttalib, a 70-year-old grandfather, is approached by a woman named Kuttalaya, who asks him to take her as his wife. Abd al-Muttalib agrees, and the two marry. Abd al-Muttalib then goes to fetch something from his own house, where he meets and talks with his son, Abdullah. Kuttalaya falls in love with Abdullah, and asks him to marry her. Abd al-Muttalib agrees, and the two marry.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkH4c8AEBQo&t=900)**  tells the story of how Muhammad met a woman named Kuttalaya, who told him that the light had left him and he could no longer fulfill the need she had of him. Years later, this event was remembered as the year of the elephant. This was a significant year for more than one reason- it was the year of Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, and it was also the year of the Battle of Badr.

[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=25) but the moabite idol had been for  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=28) generations inside the house of god and  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=32) had become for quraish a kind of  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=35) personification of the barakah that is

[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=45) there were other lesser sanctuaries  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=48) throughout arabia  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=49) and the most important of these in the  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=51) hijaz were the temples of three  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=55) daughters of god  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=57) as some of their worshippers claim them  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=59) to be

[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=68) the arabs of yathrib abd al-muttalib had  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=71) been brought up to revere manat whose  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=74) temple was at kudai on the red sea  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=77) almost due west of the oasis  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=81) more important for quresh was the shrine  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=84) of al-aluzar  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=86) in the valley of nakhla a camel's day

[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=92) another day's journey in the same  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=94) direction brought the devotee to ta'if  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=98) a wall town on a luxuriant green  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=101) tableland  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=102) inhabited by thakif a branch of the  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=106) great arab tribe of hawazin  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=110) alat was the lady of ta'if and her idol  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=115) was housed in a rich temple  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=118) as guardians of this  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=120) faqif like to think of themselves as the  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=123) counterpart of quraish  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=125) and quraish went so far as to speak  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=127) currently of the two cities  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=130) when they met mecca and taif  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=134) but despite the wonderful climate and  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=136) fertility of the garden of hijaz as  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=139) ta'if was called  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=141) its people were not unjealous of the  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=144) baron valley to their north  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=146) for they knew in their hearts that their  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=149) temple however much they might promote  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=151) it could never compare with the house of  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=155) god  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=157) nor did they altogether wish it to be  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=159) otherwise for they too were descended  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=162) from ishmael and had roots in mecca  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=166) their sentiments were mixed and somewhat  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=168) sometimes conflicting  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=171) quraish on the other hand were jealous  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=174) of no one  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=176) they knew that they lived at the center  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=178) of the world and that they had in their  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=181) midst a magnet  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=183) capable of drawing pilgrims from all  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=186) points of the compass  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=189) it was up to them to do nothing that  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=191) might diminish the good relationship  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=194) which had been established between  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=196) themselves and the outlying tribes  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=201) abd al-muttalib's office as host of  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=204) pilgrims to the kaaba  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=206) imposed on him an acute awareness of  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=209) these things  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=211) his function was an intertribal one and  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=215) it was shared to a certain extent by all  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=218) krish  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=219) the pilgrims must be made to feel that  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=222) mecca was a home from home and welcoming  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=225) them meant welcoming what they  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=228) worshipped and never failing to show  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=230) honor to the idols they brought with  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=233) them  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=235) the justification and authority for  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=237) accepting idols and believing in their  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=240) efficacy was that of tradition  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=244) their fathers and grandfathers and  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=246) great-grandfathers had done so  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=249) nonetheless god was for abda's the great  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=254) reality  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=255) and he was no doubt newer to the  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=257) religion of abraham than most of his  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=260) contemporaries are quraish  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=262) and kuzahar and hawazin and other arab  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=266) tribes  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=268) but there were and always had been a few  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=272) who maintained the full purity of  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=275) abrahamic worship  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=277) they alone realized that far from being  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=280) traditional idol worship was an  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=283) innovation a danger to be guarded  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=286) against  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=288) it only needed a longer view of history  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=291) to see that hubal was no better than the  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=293) golden calf of the sons of israel  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=298) these hunafa  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=299) the word hanif plural hunafa has the  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=303) sense of orthodox says martin lings  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=306) as they call themselves would have  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=309) nothing to do with the idols whose  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=311) presence in mecca they looked on as a  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=314) profanation and a pollution  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=318) their refusal to compromise and their  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=321) frequent outspokenness  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=323) relegated them to the fringe of meccan  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=326) society where they were respected  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=329) tolerated or ill-treated partly  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=332) according to their personalities and  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=335) partly according to whether their claims  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=337) were prepared whether their clans were  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=339) prepared to protect them or not  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=344) abbot al-muttalib knew four of the  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=347) hunafa  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=348) and one of the more respected of them  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=350) waraka by name  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=352) was the son of his second cousin nao fal  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=356) of the clan of assad  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=359) waraka had become a christian  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=361) and there was a belief amongst  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=363) christians of those parts that the  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=366) coming of a prophet was imminent  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=370) this belief may not have been widespread  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=373) but it was supported by one or two  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=376) venerable dignitaries of eastern  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=378) churches and also by the astrologers and  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=381) soothsayers  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=383) as to the jews for whom such a belief  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=386) was easier  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=388) since for them the line of prophets  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=390) ended only with the messiah  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=392) they were almost unanimous in their  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=395) expectancy of a prophet  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=398) their rabbis and other wise men assure  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=401) them that one was at hand  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=404) many of the predicted signs of his  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=406) coming had already been fulfilled  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=410) and he would of course be a jew  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=413) for their for they were the chosen  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=416) people  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=417) the christians waraka amongst them had  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=420) their doubts about this they saw no  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=423) reason why he should not be an arab  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=427) the arabs stood in need of a prophet  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=430) even more than the jews who at least  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=433) still followed the religion of abraham  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=436) inasmuch as they worshipped the one god  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=439) and did not have idols  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=442) and who but a prophet would be capable  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=444) of ridding the arabs of their worship of  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=447) false  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=448) gods in a wide circle around the kaaba  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=453) at some distance from it there were  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=456) 360 idols  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=458) and in addition to these almost every  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=461) house in mecca had its god  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=464) an idol large or small which was the  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=467) center of the household  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=470) as his last act on leaving the premises  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=474) especially if it was for a journey a man  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=477) would go to the idol and stroke it in  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=481) order to obtain blessings from it  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=485) and such was the first act on returning  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=488) home  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=490) nor was mecca exceptional in this  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=492) respect for these practices prevailed  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=495) throughout most of arabia  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=498) there were it was true some  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=500) well-established arab christian  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=502) communities to the south  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=505) in najran and the yemen  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=507) as well as to the north near the  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=509) frontiers of syria  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=512) but god's latest intervention which had  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=515) transformed the mediterranean and vast  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=518) tracts of europe had made in nearly 600  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=522) years practically no impact on the pagan  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=525) society which centered on the meccan  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=529) shrine  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=530) the arabs of the hijas and of the great  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=534) plain of najd to its east  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=537) seemed impervious to the message of the  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=539) gospels  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=542) not that croatian the other pagan tribes  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=544) were hostile to christianity  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=547) christians sometimes came to do honor to  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=550) the sanctuary of abraham and they were  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=553) made welcome like all the rest  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=556) moreover one christian had been allowed  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=558) and even encouraged to paint an icon of  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=561) the virgin mary and the child christ on  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=565) an inside wall of the kaaba where it's  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=568) sharply contrasted with all other  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=571) paintings  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=573) but quresh will more or less insensitive  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=576) to this contrast  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=578) for them it was simply a question of  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=581) increasing the multitude of idols by  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=583) another two  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=585) and it was partly their tolerance that  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=588) made them so impenetrable  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=592) unlike most of his tribe waraka could  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=595) read and have made a study of the  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=597) scriptures and of theology  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=600) he was therefore capable of seeing that  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=603) in one of christ's promises  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=605) generally interpreted by christians as  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=608) referring to the miracle of pentecost  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=611) there were nonetheless certain elements  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=614) which did not fit that miracle and must  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=617) be taken to refer to something else  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=622) something which had not yet been  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=624) fulfilled  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=626) but the language was cryptic  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=628) what was the meaning of the words  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=631) he shall not speak of himself but  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=634) whatsoever he shall hear that shall he  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=638) speak  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=640) that's the gospel of john chapter 16  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=642) verse 13.  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=644) warwicker had a sister named kuttalaya  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=648) who was very close to him  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=650) he often spoke to her about these things  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=652) and his words have made so great an  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=654) impression on her that thoughts of the  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=657) expected prophet were often in her mind  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=661) could it be he was already in their  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=664) midst  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=667) once the sacrifice of the camels had  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=669) been accepted abdal muttalib made up his  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=672) mind to find a wife for his reprieve son  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=677) and after some consideration the choice  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=680) fell on amina the daughter of wahab a  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=683) grandson of zura the brother of kusey  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=688) wahab had been a chief of zura but had  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=692) died some years previously and amina was  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=695) now a ward of his brother  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=698) wuhabe who had succeeded him as chief of  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=702) the clan  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=703) himself also had a daughter of  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=706) marriageable age  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=708) by name and when abd al-muttalib had  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=711) arranged that his son should marry amina  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=714) he asked that hala should be given in  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=717) marriage to himself  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=719) wuhab agreed and all preparations were  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=722) made for the double wedding to take  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=725) place at the same time  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=728) on the appointed day  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=730) abdal muttalib took his son by the hand  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=733) and they set off together for the  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=735) dwellings of the bani zura  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=738) on the way they had to pass the  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=740) dwellings of the bani assad  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=743) and it so happened that kute leia the  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=746) sister of warricka was standing at the  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=749) entrance to her house perhaps  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=752) deliberately in order to see what could  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=754) be seen  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=755) for everyone in mecca knew of the great  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=758) wedding which was about to take place  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=762) abdel mutaleb was now over 70 years old  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=765) but he was still remarkably young for  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=767) his age in every respect  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=771) and the slow approach of the two  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=773) bridegrooms in their natural grace  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=776) enhanced by the solemnity of the  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=778) occasion was indeed an impressive sight  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=783) but as they drew near kuttalaya had eyes  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=787) only for the younger man  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=790) abdallah was for beauty the joseph of  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=794) his times  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=795) even the oldest men and women of croatia  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=798) could not remember having seen his equal  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=802) he was now in his 25th year in the full  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=805) flower of his youth  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=808) but kutilaya was struck above all as she  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=811) had been on other occasions but never so  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=814) much as now  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=815) by the radiance which lit his face and  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=818) which seemed to her to shine from beyond  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=822) this world  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=824) could it be that  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=825) allah was the expected prophet  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=828) or was he to be the father of the  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=831) prophet  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=833) they had now just passed her and  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=836) overcome by a sudden impulse she said oh  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=840) abd allah  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=842) his father let go his hand as if to tell  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=844) him to speak to his cousin  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=847) abd allah turned back to face her and  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=851) she asked him where he was going  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=854) with my father he said simply  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=857) not out of reticence but because he felt  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=859) sure she must have known that he was on  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=862) his way to his wedding  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=865) take me here and now as thy wife she  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=869) said and thou shalt have as many camels  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=872) as those that were sacrifice in their  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=875) stead  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=877) i am with my father he replied  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=880) i cannot act against his wishes and i  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=883) cannot leave him  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=887) the two marriages took place according  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=889) to plan  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=890) and the two couples stayed for some days  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=893) in the house of wahabe  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=896) during that time abd allah went to fetch  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=899) something from his own house and again  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=902) he met kuttalaya the sister of waraka  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=906) her eyes searched his face with such  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=909) earnestness that he stopped beside her  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=912) expecting her to speak  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=915) when she remained silent he asked her  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=918) why she did not say to him what had been  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=921) said the day before  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=923) she answered him saying the light hath  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=926) left thee that was with thee yesterday  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=929) today thou canst not fulfill the need i  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=933) had of thee  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=936) the year of the marriages was a d-5  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=942) the year following this has been known  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=945) ever since  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=946) as the year of the elephant  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/QkH4c8AEBQo?t=949) and it was momentous for more than one
