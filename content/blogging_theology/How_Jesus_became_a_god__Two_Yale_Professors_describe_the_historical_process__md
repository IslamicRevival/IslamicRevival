<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> i've always found it interesting to 
consider historically how jesus became a god .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7')">0:00:07</a> and this particularly interesting work 
by two yale professors "king and messiah as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('15')">0:00:15</a> son of god divine human and angelic messianic 
figures in biblical and related literature"   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('22')">0:00:22</a> this is an academic book written by scholars 
obviously for scholars and students of the new    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('28')">0:00:28</a> testament but these two yale professors  
describe the historical process by which    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('36')">0:00:36</a> jesus became a god . i just wanted to read 
a couple of paragraphs from a chapter i'll    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('43')">0:00:43</a> just read the text it is an academic language and 
then i'll make some interpretive comments on it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('49')">0:00:49</a> and try and unpack what they are saying so bear 
with me as i read the text and then hopefully    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('54')">0:00:54</a> i'll make it clearer what i think they're getting 
at . i'm reading from a page 174 and the     
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('62')">0:01:02</a> subheading here is the issue of worship : one of 
the key questions they say in the debate about the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('68')">0:01:08</a> divinity of jesus has been whether he is worshiped 
in a way that principle agents of god are not .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('78')">0:01:18</a> it is difficult to distinguish ancient 
texts and practices expressing political   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('83')">0:01:23</a> submission and respect on the one hand 
from practices that we will call religious    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('89')">0:01:29</a> which express worship and devotion on the other 
if jesus was seen as taking over god's functions    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('97')">0:01:37</a> as king , warrior and judge at the 
End (with a capital "E") as god's agent    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('104')">0:01:44</a> his divinity may have been perceived 
primarily in functional terms at first    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('110')">0:01:50</a> but the idea of a heavenly messiah opens the door 
to speculation and rhetoric about pre-existence .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('117')">0:01:57</a> the notion of pre-existence intensifies the divine 
status of the heavenly messiah , similarly the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('124')">0:02:04</a> honorific recognition as god's son is intensified 
in language about a virginal conception .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('133')">0:02:13</a> the cultural environment must also be taken 
into account . in the hellenistic ruler cults and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('141')">0:02:21</a> especially in the imperial cults men who were once 
human beings were honored and worshipped as gods .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('150')">0:02:30</a> some were even worshipped as gods during their 
earthly lifetimes . the messiah of israel was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('155')">0:02:35</a> conceived at first primarily as a king of his own 
nation first of all and then of the whole world .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('165')">0:02:45</a> the understanding of jesus that emerged after his 
resurrection involved his kingship over israel and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> over the entire world . given the practices of 
imperial cults , it is not surprising that jesus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> was viewed as a god and that worship of him became 
an alternative to the worship of the emperor .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('188')">0:03:08</a> end quote . so that's quite a tightly packed 
academic bit of analysis there . going back to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('195')">0:03:15</a> the first paragraph one of the key questions 
about the divinity of jesus has been whether he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('200')">0:03:20</a> is worshiped in a way that principle agents of 
god are not , so in other words is there something    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> special about the divinity of the worship of 
jesus that is unique and quite different from    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('213')">0:03:33</a> the way that other agents of god were worshiped 
in a secondary sense not in the worship    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('218')">0:03:38</a> given to the one true god . and you talk about the 
difficulty of distinguishing in ancient texts    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('224')">0:03:44</a> and their practices . the differences between 
the political submission and respect    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('231')">0:03:51</a> on the one hand that's given to say a ruler and 
on the other what we would call now religious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('239')">0:03:59</a> worship . now there's a footnote here and this is 
where it goes into the greek : the use of the verb    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('246')">0:04:06</a> proskunéō in the book of revelation 
with god and the lamb as objects (proskunéō  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('254')">0:04:14</a> is sometimes translated as worship so in the book 
of revelation god and the lamb meaning jesus are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('261')">0:04:21</a> objects of worship) and then the same word is 
used with the community in philadelphia    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> also as the object of proskunéō in chapter 
three verse nine , is a case in point they say .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('277')">0:04:37</a> so the verb proskunéō 
(to worship) can have a political meaning    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('284')">0:04:44</a> even to the community in philadelphia and 
revelation 3 9 as well as be used in a more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('290')">0:04:50</a> religious sense of worship . so then they 
talk about how jesus was first the king of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> israel this is after the ascension of jesus 
and then how his kingship was extended globally    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('307')">0:05:07</a> later on , but what i find particularly interesting 
in this paragraph is the penultimate paragraph , it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312')">0:05:12</a> says : the cultural environment must also be taken 
into account when we discuss the issue of worship    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> was jesus worshipped as god . and 
they talk about the hellenistic ruler cults  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('324')">0:05:24</a> these are the the ruler cults in the greater 
roman world particularly the imperial cards to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('329')">0:05:29</a> do with the roman emperor himself where men 
(emperors) who were once human beings were honored    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('336')">0:05:36</a> subsequently and worshipped as god . sometimes at 
their death the senate would in an honorific    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> way say that they are now divine . but some were 
worshipped as gods even during their own lifetimes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('350')">0:05:50</a> and they say : the messiah of israel jesus was 
conceived at first primarily as a king of his own    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('356')">0:05:56</a> nation israel and then of the whole world . and they 
say that : the understanding of jesus that emerged    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> in the church after his resurrection ascension 
given the practices of the imperial roman cults .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('372')">0:06:12</a> it's not surprising that as the gospel 
spread outside of israel into the great    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('378')">0:06:18</a> roman world mainly through the preaching of 
paul of course and the hellenistic christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('383')">0:06:23</a> not surprising that jesus also came 
to be viewed as a god and that worship was given    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('388')">0:06:28</a> to him as an alternative to the worship of the 
emperor . so this is how they say it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('397')">0:06:37</a> important that we look at the historical and 
cultural environment in the development of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('401')">0:06:41</a> worship of jesus as a god in the first century .
there's a fascinating little footnote here in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('408')">0:06:48</a> the next chapter . chapter eight when the 
authors of this book are talking about how    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('416')">0:06:56</a> to translate the third clause of john 
1 1. this is john's gospel chapter one verse one .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('422')">0:07:02</a> and the word was god in the beginning was the 
word and the word was with god and the word was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('427')">0:07:07</a> god is the traditional christian translation .
they say john 1 1 may be translated either  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('434')">0:07:14</a> the word was god or the word was a god the 
word was a god . and then the footnote here   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> talks about someone B.A. Mastin considers it 
overwhelmingly probable that john 1 1 describes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('452')">0:07:32</a> the pre-existent logos as god in a particular work .
this conclusion though (they say) however is based  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('460')">0:07:40</a> on his view that thomas's acclamation in john 20 
28 . you remember where thomas acclaims jesus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> my lord and my god yeah an extraordinary statement .
so they say that : thomas's acclimation in 20 28    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('477')">0:07:57</a> is the one verse in the new testament which 
does unquestionably describe christ as god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('482')">0:08:02</a> but they criticize this view . this view fails to 
recognize however that the phrase dominus edeus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> and presumably its greek equivalent is an 
honorific exclamation used for example by    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('497')">0:08:17</a> those who wish to flatter domitian ( domitian is 
the roman emperor) . so what are they saying here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('503')">0:08:23</a> that they're saying : my lord and my god they're 
saying that john at the end of the first century    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('508')">0:08:28</a> is calling has thomas a claim to jesus my 
lord and my god which in latin is dominus deus .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('517')">0:08:37</a> this is an honorific acclamation known to being 
used by those at that time in the end of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> first century who wish to flatter domitian . 
domitian was a roman emperor of course . so what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('529')">0:08:49</a> john is doing , he's saying no jesus is the lord 
and god not the roman emperor . so but of course the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('538')">0:08:58</a> roman emperor wasn't really the absolute one high 
god of the universe he wasn't yahweh he wasn't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('545')">0:09:05</a> the original . no one thought that he was zeus in 
an absolute sense . it was an honorific title . it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('552')">0:09:12</a> was given to flatter him (the flash of the roman 
emperor) oh you're so marvelous you are the king    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('556')">0:09:16</a> you are the lord and god but they 
didn't really think that he was zeus or yahweh .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('563')">0:09:23</a> in the same way on the lips of thomas , thomas 
is saying in effect : no jesus is dominus edeus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('572')">0:09:32</a> not the roman emperor . so in a similar way we 
shouldn't take these words in the strongest    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('578')">0:09:38</a> sense of actually asserting that jesus is yahweh 
no that's not quite what's going on here .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('584')">0:09:44</a> it's the greek gospel equivalent or 
the title that was known to be used to flatter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('591')">0:09:51</a> the roman emperor and that's what the gospel 
writer is using that term to make his own point .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('597')">0:09:57</a> that kind of makes sense . so i think these 
two writers i'll just perhaps say a bit    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('604')">0:10:04</a> more about them one is Adela Yarbro Collins professor 
of new testament criticism interpretation at yale    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('610')">0:10:10</a> university . the other is John J. Collins professor 
of old testament criticism interpretation at yale    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('616')">0:10:16</a> university . i get the impression they are a 
married couple have an extraordinary marriage    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('619')">0:10:19</a> one is professor in the new testament . the other is a  
professor in the old testament both at yale . they    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('624')">0:10:24</a> both co-authored this . so the chapters to do 
with the old testament written by one person    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('628')">0:10:28</a> and the new testament by the other person
in the marriage so to speak .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('635')">0:10:35</a> but these are world-class experts and they 
clearly see the issue of worship    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('642')">0:10:42</a> we need to take into the cultural environment 
take that into account when we understand    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('649')">0:10:49</a> why gentile christians ultimately came to 
worship jesus as god as a counterpoint    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('656')">0:10:56</a> as a way of saying no we don't we're not going to 
worship the emperor we're going to worship jesus .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('661')">0:11:01</a> you know he is our king but of course this is 
a later development it's not something that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('666')">0:11:06</a> we find in the earliest jesus tradition . the 
evidence suggests that wasn't present at all .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('673')">0:11:13</a> so as they say in the last sentence 
given : the practice of the imperial    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('677')">0:11:17</a> cults (the roman imperial cults) it's not 
surprising that jesus was viewed as a god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> and that worship of him became an alternative to 
the worship of the roman emperor . so that's their    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('690')">0:11:30</a> insight . i think that's quite an astute comment 
and yeah what do you think . till next time
