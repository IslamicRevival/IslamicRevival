## Summary of [Islam and "LGBTQ": Gender, Sexuality, Morality & Identity with Dr Carl Sharif El-Tobgui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI)


*<span style="color:red; font-size:125%">This summary is AI generated - there may be inaccuracies</span>. [](/)*

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=3600)

 discusses how the sexual revolution has impacted Muslims and their views on LGBTQ+ people. Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui argues that the revolution has led to a separation of sex and reproduction, which has made it difficult for traditional religious believers to accept.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=0)** Sheriff Altobky discusses Islam's views on gender, sexuality, morality, and identity. He emphasizes the importance of getting our conceptual framework correct in order to understand Islam accurately. He notes that the discourse on LGBTQ+ issues has shifted so rapidly over the last few decades that many Muslims have not been able to keep up.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=300)** This talk discusses Islam's views on gender, sexuality, morality, and identity. It covers how these views differ from modern, secular viewpoints and how Muslim individuals who identify with a different gender or sexuality must navigate conflicting opinions.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=600)** Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses Islam and LGBTQ issues, discussing how literature, media, and libraries have promoted acceptance of LGBTQ individuals. He goes on to say that there is an attempt to exaggerate the number of LGBTQ characters in movies in order to make a political point.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=900)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses how LGBTQ+ rights have been advancing in recent years, and how this has impacted Muslim countries. He also discusses the appropriation of language used to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and how this can be a challenge for Muslim communities.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=1200)** The Burger King Pride Whopper campaign has sparked a backlash among people who say it is vulgar and inaccurate to name burgers after anal sex. The ad campaign features burgers with two matching buns, one top and one bottom. This is a reference to the different positions assumed in same-sex relationships.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=1500)** , Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses how Burger King Austria has apologized for advertising that does not accurately represent the sexual practices of two or three percent of the population. He also discusses how the LGBT community has fought for equality for a long time, and how this recent protest shows the strength of their alliance.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=1800)* Discusses how, in the 1960s, the Western world underwent a sexual revolution, beginning with the birth control pill. This revolution, which rejected Christian moral norms around gender, sex, and sexuality, has had a significant impact on the way Muslims view LGBTQ+ people. The modern LGBTQ+ rights movement was born in the 1960s, and while there are some things that still need to change, the impact of the sexual revolution on Muslims and LGBTQ+ people is undeniable.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=2100)* Discusses how traditional morality, religious morality, and sex reproduction have been related to one another. It says that before the 1960s, most societies viewed sex and reproduction as tightly bound together, and sex between a man and woman was only permissible within the confines of marriage. As contraception became available, many Christians began to accept artificial contraception, which they saw as a way to artificially separate sex from its natural consequences. In the 1930s, contraception became legal in most Western countries, and some Protestant denominations began to accept it as a morally viable practice.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=2400)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses how the acceptance of contraception in the West is the beginning of a separation between sex and reproduction, and how this affects Islamic views on sex and morality. He also points out that, in China, despite being a communist state, traditional views on gender and sexuality still persist.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=2700)* Discusses fallout of the sexual revolution, which has led to an increase in divorce and fatherlessness, as well as an overall decline in the number of nuclear families.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=3000)* Discusses how the rise of fatherlessness is correlated with the rise in delinquency, single motherhood, and poverty in society. It goes on to say that sexuality is tightly bound to the family system, and that norms surrounding sexuality are very stringent. Finally, it argues that wokism, or "new" religion, has the characteristics of a religion and is influenced by the sexual revolution.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=3300)* Discusses issues surrounding LGBTQ rights and Islam. Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui points out that, in terms of religious doctrine, sex should be bound together with marriage, morality, and reproduction. He argues that this is a difficult position for traditional religious believers to accept, especially in the context of the contemporary western sexual revolution.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=7200)

 discusses the role of gender and sexuality in Islam, and how these concepts are intertwined with one's identity. Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui points out that in Islam, being authentic is key to living a fulfilling life. Living in accordance with one's inner feelings is key to being authentic, and this is something that is often difficult to do in a society that demands conformity to societal norms.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=3600)** Islam is the middle ground on LGBTQ issues, and while traditional Christianity views sexuality as negative and sinful, Islam considers sexuality to be a positive part of a person's life. Augustine was a major influence on the western church's view of sexuality, and while Islam is more sex positive than traditional Christianity, celibacy is still considered a high calling in Christianity.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=3900)** Islam is not inherently anti-LGBTQ, but there are religious leaders who encourage sexual abstinence. The Qur'an affirms Mary's miraculous conception of Jesus, but does not say she remained a virgin afterwards. The five prophets of Islam are all considered great, but monasticism--a Christian innovation--is expressly rejected by the Qur'an. Paradise in the Qur'an describes sexual pleasure alongside other pleasures such as food and drink. Muslims view religious scholars as legitimate sources of guidance on sex.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=4200)** Islam attaches a great deal of importance to sexual morality, with same-sex desire and activity considered wrong in the eyes of the religion. However, over time, the western world has started to see individuals as having a sexual identity, as opposed to simply engaging in certain sexual behaviors. This new understanding of sexuality has led to the development of terms such as "gay," "straight," and "bi."
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=4500)* Discusses how the sexual revolution has antecedents, including the rise of a materialistic, mechanical worldview in the 17th century. This leads to a loss of meaning and purpose in the western world, and is a key reason why the Islamic worldview is so different. The sexual revolution has had a significant impact on western society, and is one of the main reasons why modernity is seen as a negative force.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=4800)** In the 19th century, secularization and liberalism led to the rise of the materialistic worldview and the fetishization of freedom. This in turn led to the rise of the LGBTQ movement.

Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses Islam and LGBTQ in a video. He points out that there is no difference between LGBTQ and other moral values, as they are all based on subjective emotions. He argues that secularization has led to a loss of meaning and a lack of trust in morality. He also says that in 50-60 years, Nietzsche will be considered blasphemous from a Muslim perspective because God is dead.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=5100)* Discusses role of gender and sexuality in Islam, and how these concepts are intertwined with one's identity. Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui points out that in Islam, being authentic is key to living a fulfilling life. Living in accordance with one's inner feelings is key to being authentic, and this is something that is often difficult to do in a society that demands conformity to societal norms.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend among some people in the LGBTQ community to claim that their gender identity is not tied to their physical body. They argue that because they have a male body, they should identify as men and feel like men. This viewpoint is often met with resistance, with some people calling it a disorder and claiming that it should not be the case that someone with a male body should feel like a woman. Dr. El-Tobgui argues that this viewpoint is based on a dualistic understanding of the human being, which sees the body as a prison that should be eliminated. He believes that this viewpoint is a remnant of ancient Greek philosophy, and that it is contrary to the teachings of the Abrahamic faiths, which see the body as a part of the soul that is integral to both our spiritual and physical identities.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=5400)** Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses how Islam views gender, sexuality, and morality. He argues that Islam preserves a more balanced view of these concepts than in modern times, and that this balance leads to a more integrated view of the human person. He also points out how modern attitudes towards sex and sexuality have led to a disconnection from our natural disposition, and how Islam offers a way to reconnect with our true nature.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=5700)** Islam and LGBTQ issues are discussed  with Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discussing how religion is a sign of weakness and how LGBTQ people are oppressed in Muslim countries. Freud and Marx are also discussed, with Freud being credited with the sexualization of the inner psychology and Marx seeing civilization as a struggle between the sexes. Mcintyre's book After Virtue discusses how emotivism plays a role in morality.
* **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=6000)* Discusses implications of Freud's theory that sexuality is the center of a person's identity and how this affects modern morality. It also discusses prominent thinkers from the past who pushed for sexual liberation, including Simone de Beauvoir and Wilhelm Reich.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=6300)** The authors of "After the Ball: America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 1990s" argue that the campaign to overcome public opposition to homosexuality in the 1990s was deliberately designed to subvert and undermine traditional values. The book's authors are two gay men who both attended Harvard University.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=6600)** s discuss the various issues surrounding LGBTQ people, sexuality, morality, and identity. They explore how these issues are addressed in different religions, and point out that, in modern society, sexual desire is considered to be central to human identity. They also discuss how sex is political, and how Islamic law regards sex and sexuality. s conclude with a discussion of how these issues apply to Muslims, and how they can be understood in a different context.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=6900)** In Islam, gender is considered a creation of God, with male and female genders having different roles and responsibilities. Men are given a role of superiority over women, but this is balanced by the rights and duties each gender has. This parity is emphasized in practical life, with men and women interacting differently and having different responsibilities in society.
### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=7200) - [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=10800)

 discusses the Islamic views on sexuality, gender, and morality, and how these views may be applied to LGBTQ people. It argues that, because of the ambiguity in the Quran on the issue of LGBTQ relationships, it is not possible to say with certainty that they are always wrong.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=7200)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses the Islamic perspective on gender, sexuality, morality, and identity. He points out that while there are distinctions between men and women, these distinctions have a purpose and fall within the limits set by God. He also notes that while there is racism within the Muslim community, it is not based in any Islamic principles. Instead, it is based in human beings' natural propensity for division and competition.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=7500)** describes three types of consequentialism, each with its own pros and cons. The first, deontological consequentialism, is based on the idea that moral behavior is a duty that comes from God. The second, utilitarianism, is based on the idea that the best way to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number is by taking into account the consequences of different actions. The third, divine consequentialism, is based on the idea that God knows what is best for us and that the consequences of our actions matter.
* **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=7800)* Discusses Islamic concept of modesty, which includes avoiding sexual behavior that is seen as unseemly or immodest. The discussion then turns to the contemporary moral and ethical discourse in the West, in which virtue and moral character are seen as separate concepts. In Islam, virtue and moral character are based on one's character and relationship with God. Consequently, sexual behavior is seen as relevant to moral character.  ends with a discussion of how virtue and moral character are relevant to one's homecoming, or return to God.
* **[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=8100)** Islam considers sex outside of marriage to be a sin, and it has grave consequences for one's personal virtue, moral character, and standing before God.
* **[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=8400)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses the Islamic views on sexuality and gender, and how these views regulate interactions between men and women. He also discusses masturbation, and how it is generally prohibited in Islam. Finally, he touches on the topic of consent, and how Islamic law views actions as being consensual if they are performed with the consent of both parties involved.
* **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=8700)** Islamic principles related to gender dictate that there are two genders, and that an "intersex person" (someone with a physiologically ambiguous gender) is not psychologically male or female, but rather is considered to be a male or female according to their biological sex. This is in contrast to the contemporary Western perspective that sees biological sex and psychological gender as two separate and free-floating variables.
* **[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=9000)** The key Islamic principle is that people are only morally responsible for what they have control over. This includes things like what they wear, what they feel attracted to, and what they do in their private lives. This principle is important for people who are not familiar with how these issues play out in people's actual lives.
* **[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=9300)** According to Islamic law, gender identity and sexual orientation are not morally equivalent to heterosexuality or homosexuality. Gender transitioning is prohibited, but this does not mean that people with gender dysphoria cannot live their lives in accordance with their gender identity.
* **[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=9600)** In Islam, gender and sexuality are tightly linked. Gender atypical mannerisms and expressions, such as effeminate tendencies, are considered sinful. However, while muslim men are obligated to try to rehabilitate themselves if they have gender atypical mannerisms, they are not obligated to try to be more typical of their sex. This is different from the victorian notion of women as delicate, feeble creatures.
* **[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=9900)** Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses the Islamic perspectives on gender, sexuality, morality, and identity. He points out that while there are clear Islamic guidelines that transcend culture, within these guidelines cultures can differ on these topics. He also discusses the contemporary use of the term "homosexuality" and its political and social baggage. He advises Muslims to be careful when using terms like "lgbt" because they may bring on board assumptions and confusion.
* **[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=10200)* Discusses issue of homosexuality and homosexuality in the context of religious morality in Islam. It discusses the Qur'an's mention of the people of Lot, and explains that homosexuality was the sin of Lot's people.
* **[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=10500)* Discusses slamic teachings on sexuality, gender, and morality and how these teachings are applied to LGBTQ people. It notes that while there are some verses that could be interpreted as condemning LGBTQ relationships, there are also many verses that condemn straight people who engage in same-sex behavior.

 argues that, because of this ambiguity, it is not possible to say with certainty that LGBTQ relationships are always wrong. It also points out that there are many verses in the Quran that deal specifically with the gender of the partner in a same-sex relationship, and that these verses cannot be interpreted in a way that justifies LGBTQ relationships.
### [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=10800) - [03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=13800)

 Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses the Islamic perspective on gender, sexuality, and morality. He argues that all of these issues are intrinsically prohibited and lead to other prohibited acts. He also discusses a support group for Muslim individuals who are struggling with same-sex attractions or gender dysphoria.

**[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=10800)** , Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses the difference between gender and sexuality, and how Islam views LGBTQ people. He points out that in ancient times, homosexual acts were considered a crime, and argues that the traditional interpretation of the Bible is correct.
* **[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=11100)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui explains that Islam does not condemn homosexuality, as argued by some revisionist scholars. El-Tobgui also discusses how contemporary muslims can reconcile faith and sexuality. He says that scripture can be understood in a human context, and that muslim revisionists are not correct in their understanding of scripture.
* **[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=11400)** In Islam, there are three separate categories for acts of homosexuality: permissible (halal), impermissible (haram), and non-penetrative (neither halal nor haram). There are also two categories of gross enormities for sexual behavior: zina (vaginal intercourse between a man and woman not married to each other) and liwat (male-male nuat sodomy).
* **[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=11700)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses Islam's views on gender, sexuality, and morality. He explains that all of these issues are intrinsically prohibited and lead to other prohibited acts. He also discusses a support group for Muslim individuals who are struggling with same-sex attractions or gender dysphoria.
* **[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=12000)* Discusses issues of gender, sexuality, and morality within Islam, and provides resources for Muslims who are struggling with these issues. It discusses the "gay identity paradigm," which is a modern Western social construct that opposes islam. It discusses the need for Muslims to have a realistic understanding of their experiences, and to be patient in working through these issues.
* **[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=12300)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses the LGBTQ issue from a religious perspective, emphasizing the importance of the identity paradigm. He points out that while homosexuality may be uncommon, it is not an identity that all gay people must embrace. He also discusses how to deal with colleagues and classmates who are LGBTQ, stressing the importance of understanding and respect.
* **[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=12600)* Discusses need to establish an Islamic gender and sexuality paradigm that is different from the contemporary western one. They believe in gender essentialism and the gender binary, and go to the meanings and wisdom of legislation to establish it. Sexual expression is legitimate only in the context of marriage which is by definition heterosexual. They also critique and deconstruct the western paradigm post-sexual revolution. This is a harmful ideology that leads to chaos in the realm of homosexuality, heterosexuality, and partnered sex. The western colonial project is non-negotiable and is creating similar problems in the muslim world as it has in the past. These ideologies were born in Britain and America, and the movement of power and influence is the same. Rejection of the sexual identity paradigm is necessary in order to establish an Islamic gender and sexuality paradigm that is different and stable.
* **[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4aHFvrCuI&t=12900)**  Dr. Carl Sharif El-Tobgui discusses how Islamic principles should dictate how Muslims approach LGBTQ+ people. He argues that using identity-laden terms like "gay" or "lgbtq" is inappropriate and contributes to the LGBTQ+ community being stigmatized.

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2) Hello everyone and welcome to blogging theology 
today I'm delighted to talk again to Dr Carl    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8) Sheriff Altobky you're almost welcome sir thank 
you so much for having me again Paul it's a    
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14) pleasure to be back Sheriff is a professor of 
Arabic and Islamic studies at Brandeis university    
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=21) in the United States his expertise is in 
Islamic thought particularly Islamic theology    
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=27) law and jurisprudence and also in the 
Arabic language Quranic classical and modern    
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=34) as well as classical Arabic literature and poetry 
now according to the BBC website and i quote June    
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=44) is pride month a month dedicated to celebrating 
LGBTQ + communities all around the world    
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=55) unquote today uh Sheriff has kindly agreed to 
discuss Islam and LGBTQ gender sexuality morality    
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=66) and identity that's the title of his presentation 
now this is now an incredibly important subject    
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=74) for Muslims to understand because the the west the 
media corporations and governments now insist that    
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=82) everyone including Muslims give unconditional 
approval to LGBTQ + people and communities    
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=91) it's therefore vital that we have an accurate and 
reliable understanding of what Islam teaches from    
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=98) a respected Muslim academic we need to ask how did 
we get here and realize the importance of getting    
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=106) our conceptual framework right and explore 
the islamic paradigm on sex and sexuality    
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=115) so over to you Sheriff okay thank 
you so much for the introduction  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=124) welcome to everyone here today i'm very happy 
to be back and to get into this topic which is    
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=129) a very very important topic i don't think i have 
to explain to anyone why or how important it is    
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=134) particularly for people who are in the west 
um the topic has become one that is pervasive    
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=139) it is omnipresent everywhere we look and as we 
will see over the course of this presentation    
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=145) um it is no longer sufficient for religious 
communities such as muslims simply to say oh    
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=149) well we don't approve of particular behaviors 
just like we don't approve of drinking or    
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=153) premarital sex between men and women we also 
don't approve of you know homosexual behavior    
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=158) um the the discourse on the topic has shifted so 
radically and so quickly over the last couple of    
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=165) decades that you know we're basically playing on 
an entirely different playing field right now and    
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=170) there are a whole there's a whole 
set of deeply embedded assumptions    
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=174) which have conspired to make this issue something 
that is very very different from a simple    
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=181) judgment as to what is say halal or in terms of 
behavior of course according to islam essentially    
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=186) that's you know what we're dealing with when we're 
talking about particular behaviors but there is so    
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=191) much more to the issue than that uh that it is no 
longer sufficient for muslims just to stop there    
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=198) both in terms of explaining our position and 
our religion frankly to those who are not muslim    
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=203) and increasingly also within our own ranks 
particularly among our youth who have grown    
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=207) up in the western westernized environments as 
we will see the contemporary lgbtq discourse    
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=213) is um basically it's put out as a moral 
discourse um we are given to understand    
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=219) that this is a question primarily of equality 
of dignity of human rights uh and so forth    
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=225) um and that if one does not approve for example 
of particular kinds of behaviors or relationships    
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=230) then one is actually opposed to all of these 
things that are otherwise wonderful i mean we    
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=235) you know the prophet peace be upon him said give 
every person who's due right so we believe in    
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=240) giving people their rights we believe in 
justice justice is very central to islam    
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=243) it always has been um but the the the discourse is 
put across uh in a that defines justice inequality    
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=252) and rights and compassion and dignity and so 
forth in very specific ways which actually are    
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=256) at loggerheads with islamic understandings 
of these concepts and also make mincemeat    
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=262) frankly of traditional islamic understandings of 
things like gender sexuality sexual moral norms    
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=267) and so forth and so we really need to dig deep 
um in order to have a proper conceptualization    
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=273) of what it is that we're actually dealing with 
today very often you have a westernized young    
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=279) muslim person going to a sheikh from quote unquote 
back home you know a traditional muslim country    
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=283) and asking oh i think i'm gay or what does 
that mean or can i and the sheikh doesn't just    
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=288) says oh it's haram and the child the the youth is 
asking about an identity is asking about feelings    
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=293) it's asking about a political orientation you know 
asking about many different things and the scholar    
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=298) is just understanding oh he's asking about sodomy 
you know can he have anal sex like oh in the shady    
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=303) that's haram you know end of story and there's 
kind of a complete miscommunication because    
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=307) they're coming from two completely different 
what are now completely different paradigms    
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=311) of looking at again sex sexuality you know uh 
gender interactions morality what human beings    
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=318) are and what it means to be human so we're gonna 
dig deep and get into all of this before starting    
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=322) i just want to um to to tell people this is going 
to be a lengthy uh presentation there's also a lot    
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=329) of detail there are a lot of slides and the slides 
have a lot of information it is necessary i think    
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=335) given our circumstances to take the time to go 
through and to really understand these issues very    
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=340) deeply and precisely with the proper conceptual 
vocabulary in the proper terminology and that    
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=346) is why paul and i have decided to to give it its 
due and to really take the time that's necessary    
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=350) in addition i have asked paul to post the slide 
deck to connect it to the presentation so that    
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=357) it will be publicly available anyone can you 
know download it as a pdf to use it to review it    
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=363) um you know to use it in your own teaching or 
or or holocause or study circles or whatever    
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=370) i think it's just important that the knowledge 
get out and that people have access to it    
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=374) so that is going to be an outstanding 
resource for um you know the coming months    
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=378) and years for people to come back to it's going to 
be detailed thorough the presentation the slides    
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=382) are very professionally produced obviously from an 
expert perspective so i think this is a wonderful    
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=388) opportunity to set the record straight no no pun 
intended right okay all right so without further    
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=396) ado um so the title of the talk as paul mentioned 
is islam and lgbtq gender sexuality morality and    
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=403) identity um lgbtq is enclosed in uh parentheses 
here or square sorry in quotation marks um because    
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=412) i will be problematizing the term itself and the 
conceptual baggage that underlies it and again    
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=417) that's very important to the work that we need 
to do so um if anyone wonders why that's in uh uh    
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=424) quotation marks that is the reason why i'd also 
like to say that this uh talk today is a kind of    
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=429) expanded version of a talk i gave about a year and 
a half ago online to a community in houston texas    
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=434) um that talk is if you go on uh youtube you will 
see it and it has the title gender sexuality    
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=440) morality and identity in islam um and it's 
based on the same slide deck except this deck is    
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=445) somewhat expanded and so um this would be you know 
presumably the um the go-to lecture you know um    
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=453) once it's out um if you come across both of 
those this would be the more updated in the more    
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=458) expanded version um okay all right good great so 
the contents um we're gonna first start by setting    
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=468) the stage to now is june the month of june which 
has been uh identified or billed as uh pride month    
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=475) in many countries in the west and also other parts 
of the world so we want to just look you know    
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=479) how uh we where we are today in the year 
1443-2022 and then how did we get here um    
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=487) and then as paul mentioned the importance of our 
conceptual framework this is absolutely critical    
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=492) because um as i already mentioned the language 
that we use in the conceptual framework that    
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=497) we bear that we bring to bear on an issue 
are absolutely critical in terms of how we    
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=501) conceptualize and therefore judge that issue um 
and again so many changes have taken place deep    
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=507) beneath the surface of our conscious understanding 
that we have to do a lot of digging and also    
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=511) expend a lot of effort in order to understand how 
that we are how we are really dealing with two    
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=516) very different conceptual paradigms now when 
we talk about islam and islamic worldview in    
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=522) general and on sexuality and gender in particular 
and a the kind of modern western secular you know    
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=528) modern slash postmodern now world view on the 
other hand these are two very different kind of    
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=534) approaches ways of looking at the world ways of 
construing reality that depart from very very    
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=540) different and often kind of diametrically opposed 
assumptions and i think the more we realize that    
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=546) the easier it will be for us in our own hearts 
and minds to kind of navigate some of these um    
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=552) differences of opinion and clashes frankly which 
which arise and will presumably continue to do    
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=558) so on this issue and others and so after we um 
talk about that we will get into the islamic    
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=563) paradigm of on gender sex and sexual morality in 
general and then we will go into homosexuality and    
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=568) transgenderism in particular and we will do that 
from two angles we will look at the kind of moral    
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=574) considerations so kind of what islam teaches 
what the sharia says about particular actions    
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=579) that's kind of from a sort of objective 
perspective if we can say the way things    
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=584) are in and of themselves regarding the moral 
valuation particular act and then we'll also    
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=589) look at it from the kind of subjective perspective 
what about muslims who find themselves dealing    
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=594) with same-sex attractions or gender dysphoria 
or gender identity disorder um uh how how can    
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=601) we understand this phenomenon how can muslims in 
those shoes deal with this in a in an islamic way    
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=608) while staying true to the teachings in the message 
of islam and how can we as a muslim community    
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=613) support muslims who are struggling with these 
types of issues which are very real issues and can    
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=617) be very difficult in deep issues how can we best 
serve and help our brothers and sisters in their    
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=623) struggle to live their lives uh in accordance with 
the will of allah as all muslims are called to do    
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=629) and so and then we will move on to a summary and 
conclusion and then i will go over some resources    
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=634) on our community has really produced some great 
resources over the last just half decade four    
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=639) five years five six years just a handful of 
individuals and we'll see them by the end of this    
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=643) and so i'd like to walk you through some of the 
resources so that you know where to go after    
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=647) this talk is over and you are and you want to uh 
continue your education uh on this topic and your    
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=653) engagement with it so without further ado um i 
just want to paint a picture of where we are today    
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=663) so yes yeah so in terms of literature we said 
that kind of presence of of the lgbt uh narrative    
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=671) uh um is everywhere and so starting with 
say literature right uh we see a significant    
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=677) growth of lgbt literature that is targeting youth 
specifically over the past decade so you have this    
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=682) uh series called the lumberjanes which is 
a popular comic book series uh consisting    
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=687) of 75 issues that is directed to teenagers 
and the protagonist is a navajo trans woman    
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=694) so a biological male who's 
transitioned to present is female    
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=698) with two gay fathers so this is a protagonist in 
the year 2010 there were approximately 10 books    
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=704) published by mainstream publishers for young 
adults with lgbt characters in them by 2016    
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=710) and mere six years later the number climbed 
to 80. so it um it multiplied eight-fold in    
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=718) mere in six years remarkable and then you have the 
annual rainbow book list which provides updates    
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=724) concerning lgbt books ranging from infants up 
until 18 years old so if there are materials    
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=730) yes yes material is now being produced for the 
youngest of the young so that when people first    
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=736) become aware of their surroundings there 
is sort of an lgbt kind of presence and    
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=741) and narrative that is present in their kind of 
first uh um first uh acquaintance with the world    
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=748) if we can say right which is something that 
was just would have been unimaginable just    
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=752) you know very short time ago don't imagine this 
is unimaginable now i would say for many people  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=759) yeah and then libraries throughout the country 
throughout america as well as probably other    
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=763) western countries now host drag queen story hours 
perhaps some people have seen pictures of this    
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=768) so public libraries um elementary 
schools they bring drag queens so    
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=772) men who are dressed very flamboyantly as women 
with wigs and big dresses and makeup come in and    
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=778) read to children um you know and the children 
have a great laugh and also they kind of become    
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=782) more familiar with and desensitized to this type 
of behavior which you know until very recently    
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=788) would have just been considered a kind of bizarre 
fetish that you did in some cabaret in a nightclub    
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=792) on the weekend you know dressing up in dragon 
and whatever and now this is being mainstreamed    
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=797) you know for children so this is a very very 
different playing field even in the west from    
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=801) what we were dealing with just 10 20 years ago and 
things are changing very very rapidly so that's    
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=807) literature enough we go to media we see of the 118 
films that the organization glad which is one of    
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=813) the uh predominant lgbt advocacy organizations 
they counted 118 films from the major studios    
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=821) in the year 2019 and 22 of these films contained 
characters who identified as lgbtq so this is 18.6    
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=829) which is something like five to six times the 
percentage of people who actually identify as lgbt    
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=834) in society now that number has shifted from you 
know one point five to three percent to five    
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=839) percent to ten percent um you know it depends 
on the way you count what it means to sort of    
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=844) identify as lgbtq some definitions are very loose 
um you know so we have to take the statistics    
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=850) with a grain of salt but um but certainly the 
idea that 20 of characters in movies identifies    
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=856) lgbt is certainly way beyond you know um uh what 
we see in in reality so there's a sort of over    
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=863) representation if you will just statistically 
speaking um that we see in the movies but this    
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=868) is something that's been um been encouraged but 
yeah there's massive over representation of people    
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=874) in the films is deliberate policies it's not just 
a random statistical fluke so there's an attempt    
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=878) here to exaggerate to make a political point i i 
assume ultimately one right yes i mean whatever    
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=886) the motivation behind it seems like there is 
some type of uh something like that afoot here so    
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=891) um and then a new database from insider confirms 
the existence of more than 250 lgbtq plus    
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=897) characters in children's cartoons dating back to 
1983 1983 is a long time ago so i'm assuming the    
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=903) majority of these are probably the last 10 15 
years but 250 since 1983 which is about almost    
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=909) 40 years and if you look at the data from 2010 to 
2020 especially the latter five years right um so    
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=916) to 2015 to 2020 the representation of overtly 
queer character skyrocket so indeed it goes    
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=922) like this and then it skyrockets in the last five 
years which is right after the obergefell decision    
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=928) is passed in the united states in 2015 which 
allowed for same-sex marriage across the country    
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=935) sesame street spongebob and other 
such children shows have all had    
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=940) openly lgbt characters by this point if we go 
now to schools and i'm just talking about the    
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=947) united states here california colorado illinois 
and new jersey oregon rhode island in washington    
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=951) now mandate specific lgbt education at the 
elementary levels or at some level of schooling    
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=960) other states have rolled out in quote-unquote 
inclusive curriculum standards but have not    
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=964) necessarily signed statewide bills at least not 
of yet organizations like the sogi education    
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=973) soggy education in canada sogi stands for sexual 
orientation and gender identity education in    
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=978) canada are devoted to advancing lgbt education 
in schools and many people may have heard of the    
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=986) latest brawl with disney the disney corporation 
in florida when the governor of florida actually    
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=992) moved to ban discussion and teaching of lgbt 
related themes in uh florida state classrooms    
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=998) in the first and second grades so we're just 
talking about i mean first and second grade    
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1002) and before um and disney under pressure from 
certain groups um you know came out in force and    
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1009) said we are completely against this legislation 
it's homophobic it's wrong we're going to throw    
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1013) the full weight of our company behind trying to 
overturn it and there's been a big spat back and    
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1017) forth now between disney corporation and um the 
governor of interesting that disney has become    
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1023) heavily politicized now it used to be you know 
i used to watch it for cartoons and so on as a    
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1027) kid but now it's actively involved in political 
campaigns to attack politicians and and their    
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1034) representatives in putting forward legislation so 
this is extraordinary how politicized corporations    
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1039) even disney are these days right right and 
it's uh you know uh interesting that you    
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1045) should mention that because our very next slide 
we're gonna meet this gender gender bred person    
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1049) later on in the um in this in the presentation so 
we'll come back to him or her you know the person    
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1056) i noticed the brain of this gingerbread firstly 
the gingerbread man has a brain which is i didn't    
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1059) realize they had problems but anyway uh this one 
has a multi-colored brain as well that surely does    
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1066) and you mentioned corporations so you know 
um going on to uh well actually we'll get to    
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1071) corporations the next slide but global affairs 
so there's pressure growing now on muslim    
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1076) countries as well to become quote-unquote 
lgbt affirming and so you can see here    
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1081) earlier this month you know in june pride 
month the u.s embassy u.s embassy accounts    
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1086) in muslim countries tweeted in support of 
pride month and you can see here an example    
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1090) the u.s embassy in kuwait all human beings should 
be treated with respect and dignity and should    
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1094) be able to live without fear no matter who they 
are or whom they love potus the president of the    
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1099) united states is a champion for the human rights 
of lgbtqi persons prior to 2022 you are included    
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1107) is potus also uh campaigning for the rights 
of muslim men to of a polygamous marriage    
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1112) uh presumably he's not as it's illegal 
in the united states i don't recall him    
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1115) campaigning for muslim rights to have chronically 
sanctioned marriages but anyway that's just my    
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1121) my right exactly and we'll come to the you know 
also we can look at the language here right all    
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1126) human beings should be treated with respect 
and dignity and we would agree with that as    
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1129) muslims right we agree with treating people with 
respect and dignity the idea is that how is this    
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1134) understood what does what do respect and dignity 
consist of and we're going to realize that a big    
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1139) part of the challenge that muslims face on 
this issue today is the kind of appropriation    
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1143) of language a very um you know emotively resonant 
language like respect and dignity and giving very    
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1151) specific definitions and meanings to those terms 
it's loaded it's loaded language it's not neutral    
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1155) language descriptive objective it's heavily loaded 
with an ideal ideology and so it is meant to kind    
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1161) of force you to express that ideology in the 
very words that's used right and the implication    
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1167) here of course is that if you don't if you're not 
fully on board with you know homosexual behavior    
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1171) relationships family structures and so forth then 
you are you actually lack respect for people's    
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1176) dignity right which that's a pretty serious 
moral charge right that's not a neutral thing    
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1181) to say oh you don't respect people's dignity right 
that's that's a very loaded kind of moral charge    
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1187) and this is what muslims and other kind of more 
traditional religious believers are facing now    
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1191) and so we need to understand where this comes from 
and also how we can best conceptualize and respond    
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1196) to this um and so this you know movements also now 
into some res in some respects has become a tool    
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1203) of demonization and even oppression so aipac 
the american israeli public affairs council    
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1209) posted a tweet reading do you support lgbtq plus 
rights hamas doesn't hamas discriminates against    
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1215) lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex 
people so the subtext here is that look at those    
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1221) evil you know people over there who are not 
pro-lgbtq meaning they are not really part of    
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1228) modern civilized society and therefore western 
public should not support them or be sympathetic    
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1233) to their own struggles and their own plights right 
in their own oppression because after all they're    
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1238) not pro-lgbt rights apac representing israelis 
or jews the jewish faith itself the jewish bible    
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1245) of course would no way support any of these uh 
behaviors uh cross-dressing is is prohibited    
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1252) uh sodomy is prohibited in leviticus so the 
irony is that this is completely contrary to    
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1256) the very jewish faith that many of their 
supporters being jews would presumably uh    
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1262) support so there's something very very odd 
going on there that a jewish organization should    
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1266) advocate completely contrary to the jewish faith 
right and you know again we'll see reasons behind    
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1272) that you know um but you're right that it would 
seem on the surface to be rather uh in incongruous    
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1279) um also imams certainly maps have been banned from 
entering particular european countries on account    
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1284) of lgbt critical teachings uh and preaching right 
so if you say that that the religion doesn't    
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1290) allow for example um same-sex relationships 
or behavior this is considered hate speech    
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1295) uh for many people and so their imams have been 
banned you know from from speaking in this way    
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1301) um okay so global affairs now if we move 
on to corporations which you mentioned paul    
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1305) this is something which really surprised me when i 
first came across this i don't know if people have    
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1308) seen the burger king pride whopper which was uh 
put out by burger king in austria i i thought this    
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1315) was satur when i first saw this on twitter i was 
convinced this was just a joke because there are    
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1319) satirical organizations but this turns out to 
be an actual burger king advert i believe yes    
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1325) absolutely you're absolutely right um and so 
uh the headline of a story that ran about this    
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1331) reads burger king ad prompts apology after pride 
whopper campaign featuring burgers with top and    
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1337) bottom buns sparks a backlash um i don't know if 
people are picking up on this you know symbolism    
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1344) here but obviously you can see the two top buns 
and the two bottom bun so it's like same same    
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1349) but also top and bottom is a not very subtle 
reference to the different positions that are    
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1354) assumed in same-sex you know relationship between 
you know basically anal sex between men where one    
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1360) plays the top role and one plays the bottom row 
and you know i was wondering when i first saw this    
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1365) top and bottom okay do they really mean that like 
that's so vulgar to put on a on a food hamburger    
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1371) where children can buy them and you know i 
mean it's just you know exactly i was like    
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1374) maybe they just meant like really the top bun in 
the bottom but if you read the story you know um    
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1379) you'll find that there's there's a difference of 
opinion there's like istilaf that you know people    
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1383) are have a difference in the like tafsir of this 
uh you know burger this pride right and how to    
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1390) but it's but many people say no no obviously i 
mean tops and bottoms like of course you know if    
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1394) you're if you're familiar with kind of gay culture 
and gay lingo it's like a very obvious you know    
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1397) reference and so then we read like in this article 
the fast food chains advertising agency issued an    
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1403) apology on sunday for a much ridiculed tone-deaf 
marketing campaign announcing the pride whopper    
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1409) a burger served with two matching buns now you 
might think okay the apology you know this has    
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1414) been ridiculed tone deaf that people might have 
objected to a major you know decades-old uh you    
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1421) know respected international um corporation 
i guess maybe to say respected international    
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1427) corporation might be a contradiction in terms 
but anyway a well-known international corporation    
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1431) that has been selling burgers to the world for you 
know decades now and has a big name burger king    
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1436) you know are is now selling hamburgers and naming 
them with terms that basically overtly reference    
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1443) sodomy max of sodomy of nail milk i mean let's 
call it call it spade a spade here that's what    
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1448) we're talking about acts of something so people 
would be like why are why are we being sold    
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1453) burgers that we're gonna eat that are named 
after you know anal sex and but but you would    
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1459) be wrong if you thought that that's why there 
was offense taken at this in fact right we read    
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1464) the ad quote includes a burger with two bun 
tops and another with two bottoms a seemingly    
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1469) misinformed nod to sex within the lgbtq plus 
community now how do we understand this within    
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1475) days of the outgoing life people around the globe 
took to social media to comment on the campaign    
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1479) citing the chain's failure to understand quote 
unquote how gay sex works as well as critique    
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1485) corporate rainbow washing during pride month 
so the idea is that okay in a real you know um    
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1491) relationship right you can't have two tops or two 
bottoms the idea is that one person is the top and    
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1496) one person is the bottom so this misrepresents 
the male male sexual act because you know you're    
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1503) presenting two tops and two bodies one more why 
did i get my head around so they've been created    
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1507) a major international hamburger corporation 
has been criticized for not understanding the    
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1511) sexual practices of two or three percent of the 
population i mean th this is kind of so weird that    
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1518) i i i can't i'm not representing it properly not 
representing them probably in their advertising    
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1525) right it's a misrepresentation of the actual act 
right because they don't know how gay sex works    
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1531) because they didn't do their homework and they 
didn't consult with the lgbt community on it    
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1534) and that's why we see how would you get your 
homework on this but anyway we'll go there    
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1538) so burger king austria you know apologized into 
the post you know they put out a post and then    
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1543) the post continues we've learned our lessons 
and we'll include experts on communicating    
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1547) with the lgbtq community for future work 
as promoting equal love and equal rights    
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1552) will still be a priority for us so they've 
learned their lesson you know if you're going    
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1556) to be representing um you know male male sex acts 
in your in your food products you need to do so    
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1562) um accurately and you know as you do i mean as you 
you have you know you mentioned sodomy when you're    
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1567) advertising for hamburgers i mean what's what's 
your object to that you know and then we see again    
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1572) here you know of course the ultimate goal is a 
promoting of equal love and equal rights so again    
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1576) these terms which you know have a lot of kind 
of emotive baggage right equal of equal rights    
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1580) um which you know once you read that well who 
would be opposed to equal love who would be    
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1583) opposed to equal rights and the idea is like 
no decent person would be and if you are then    
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1587) you're not a decent person right you're not a 
moral human being and then the last kind of um  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1595) thing i want to point out here is lgbt and islam 
specifically now this poster that you see here    
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1601) you can see the date on the bottom is may 17 
2022 so um just last month uh this was the    
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1607) international day against homophobia transphobia 
and biphobia and this uh poster was produced under    
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1613) the auspices of a canadian university and was um 
was displayed within that university and also in a    
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1619) number of high schools in ontario canada so you 
can say see again celebrate the power of love    
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1625) right the constant appeal to love and then 
you see these two men about to kiss you know    
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1631) a biracial couple and then you see a couple a 
heterosexual couple of color and then you see    
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1637) a you know multiply abled couples so someone in a 
wheelchair and then a able-bodied person and then    
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1643) in the bottom left-hand corner you see again two 
like a biracial muslim two muslim females women in    
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1650) hijab and they're about to kiss now i blotted that 
out because many muslims rightly so were quite    
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1656) outraged at this image and so i didn't want to 
you know um expose it further but i did want    
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1662) to just uh give people a nice sense of what 
is actually going on we know they're muslim    
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1666) obviously because they're wearing hijab and that's 
that we've been uh targeted for that uh yeah okay    
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1672) exactly yeah and so um again so the lgbtq nation 
put out a they ran a story on this uh university    
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1680) pulls image of women in hijabs kissing after 
muslim community protests so when the when the    
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1686) image first came out the muslim community was very 
upset they were very offended they were up in arms    
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1690) and they started um and one of them one person 
commented said shame on you for such an insulting    
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1696) mockery post to my religion one commenter wrote 
about the call to quote unquote celebrate the    
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1701) power of love now the university in question 
initially responded to the post by stating that    
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1706) they understood the image might be quote unquote 
upsetting to some muslims and calling the topic    
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1711) quote unquote complex and intersectional right but 
in the beginning they said they were not going to    
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1716) take it down as the muslim community continued to 
protest um and to sign a petition which garnered i    
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1721) think several thousand signatures in a very short 
period of time they actually eventually pulled it    
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1725) down due to muslim pressure which i was actually 
quite surprised uh exactly i mean this to me    
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1731) the remarkable thing about this story i mean 
apart from the sadly predictable poster is    
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1735) um the fact that the this major institution this 
library did respond to muslim uh uh pushback on    
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1742) this and decided to take it down and that that 
is remarkable i wouldn't have expected that to    
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1746) be honest in the west right exactly and it was 
not just you know it was it was islamic centers    
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1752) and uh you know private individuals but also high 
school students muslim high school students in    
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1757) ontario public schools where this was posted who 
staged walkouts and said we do not accept this    
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1762) because our religion again we're looking at 
this particular act the act is prohibited by our    
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1766) religion and it is disrespectful to our religion 
and therefore islamophobic to try to force    
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1775) muslim symbols especially the hijab is 
like a symbol of purity and devotion    
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1779) right and to represent it in a way where two 
people are who are wearing the hijab are engaging    
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1783) in something that's explicitly prohibited by the 
religion as if you show someone a hijab you know    
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1788) drinking alcohol or doing something else or a man 
in a kufi and a beard you know i don't know doing    
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1792) something that the religion prohibits this would 
be considered kind of appropriating our religion    
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1797) and pushing into the service of something which 
it doesn't actually support it it just seems to    
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1801) just however sadly that there's a hierarchy when 
it comes to phobias so at the top of the the tree    
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1806) comes homophobia transphobia and biphobia we 
should be really really really concerned about    
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1810) those uh islamophobia is not so important because 
it can be over uh can be accepted as long as it's    
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1816) in the service of uh uh international day against 
homophobia et cetera this is a it seems to be a    
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1821) hierarchy here of people you can offend exactly 
yeah and the um lgbtq nation article it sort of    
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1828) ends dutifully with this with this statement and 
we will see the you know degree of uh uh you know    
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1834) truth or untruth of the statement as we go through 
the presentation but they say muslim culture isn't    
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1838) inherently anti-gay the quran says nothing about 
homosexuality unlike the bible islamic history is    
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1844) filled with texts openly depicting homosexuality 
is a beautiful matter-of-fact thing and more    
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1849) american muslims support same-sex marriage than 
do christian evangelicals protestants and mormons    
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1855) according to a pew research study now we notice 
here you know the bible says the quran says    
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1859) nothing about homosexuality this is a you know um 
it is fake news is it the word doesn't exist the    
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1865) word there's not a pure research study which 
may be true the rest of it is fake it's fake    
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1869) yeah basically basically right and then the text 
being filled with openly depicting homosexuality    
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1874) i know what they're talking about we can get to 
this later but you know again what they mean here    
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1879) by homosexuality is is not doesn't really map one 
to one on what is being discussed here and you    
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1884) know and we'll get to this you know acts versus 
desires versus intentions and so on and so forth    
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1889) but anyway you know they end it this way uh as 
part of again a rhetorical sort of flourish to    
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1894) show that muslims you know how does the how does 
the article start university pulls image of women    
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1900) and hideouts kissing after muslim community 
protests well obviously this muslim community    
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1904) must just be a bunch of backwards bigots because 
they protested over this thing which their own    
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1911) holy text doesn't even say anything about in their 
own history has celebrated as being a beautiful    
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1917) matter of fact thing so what's wrong with these 
you know it's amazing yeah right and so you so    
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1922) again we have to be very careful of sort of the 
rhetoric that is used to frame the issue in a very    
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1926) particular way so this is kind of you know 
where we are today right june uh 2022.    
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1933) um the question is how did we get here how do we 
get here for young people this is pretty much all    
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1939) they know if you're 20 or younger you grew up in a 
world where gay marriage was a fact of life where    
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1945) homosexuality was only present on the television 
and you know but people like me i'm only in my 40s    
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1950) so i'm not that old but this is all very very new 
i mean i grew up at a time where this was still    
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1955) very very taboo and there was a very different 
conversation about it which we'll also get to    
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1960) as we go through because again there's been 
a very very rapid and very radical shift in    
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1964) the discourse which is important for muslims 
to understand if they're going to be able to    
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1968) conceptualize and and respond to this properly 
so how do we get here so this takes us back to    
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1975) the sexual revolution now the sexual revolution 
begins in the 1960s late 1960s and this is sort    
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1981) of the most obvious proximate cause to where 
we are today but there are antecedent causes    
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1986) the sexual revolution there are you know things 
about it which start as a stir in the 1930s we'll    
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1992) get to this you know and then came into full bloom 
in the 60s and then even before that developments    
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=1996) that take place from the beginning of the modern 
period you know 17th 18th 19th centuries also you    
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2001) know laid the groundwork to get to a point where 
by the 1960s in western culture specifically    
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2006) the sexual revolution almost looks like inevitable 
if not inevitable like it's just waiting to happen    
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2012) right and then it's waiting for a catalyst to 
happen and then catalyst comes about we'll see    
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2016) um in the form of the birth control pill and other 
kind of social movements that were afoot in this    
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2021) in the 1960s but it's very important 
to understand um the sexual revolution    
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2026) um as part of this um as part of this larger 
narrative now the sexual revolution is basically    
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2032) it represents a fundamental rejection of christian 
or more generally abrahamic religious moral norms    
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2038) surrounding gender sex and sexuality so up until 
the 1960s at least you know the official kind of    
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2043) moral norms in the west were pretty much aligned 
with with christianity um premarital sex was    
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2049) very much taboo um it was not something you know 
living together outside of marriage was completely    
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2054) unheard of in the west before the 1960s at least 
in america i think also in europe as well um you    
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2059) know you did not just live with someone of the 
opposite sex outside of marriage that was just    
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2063) not done like in the muslim world today it's just 
it's unheard of like it's just not done nobody    
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2067) people might like have relations but 
you don't you know it's like hush hush    
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2071) and it's not something that like you know that's 
accepted and it's certainly not something that you    
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2075) just would do so openly um up until this time also 
in the 1960s um people were very reticent about    
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2082) discussing matters that that that were related 
to sexuality so on on american um soap operas for    
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2089) example in the 1960s they did not you could not 
even say the word pregnant on public television    
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2094) right now there's nothing really wrong with 
that for from our perspective as muslims but    
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2098) the idea was that even that was too forward it 
was kind of too direct you know and so they used    
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2102) euphemisms that a woman was said to be with 
child or expecting you know you couldn't    
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2108) if you had a movie in the theater where a woman's 
chest was shown bear chest for like two seconds    
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2112) it was immediately slapped with an r rating 
you know restricted audiences no one under 17    
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2117) without an adult accompanying them 
right this is considered very shocking    
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2120) um at the same time you know you have 
for example pornography was completely    
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2124) uh forbidden it was prohibited by law in the west 
and i don't just mean pictures or videos i mean    
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2130) also just written like salacious novels even that 
like just you know written descriptions that were    
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2135) very explicit were actually you couldn't sell 
them legally in european capitals and in the    
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2139) united states um so what happened so basically in 
the 1960s you get a a radical kind of rejection of    
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2150) of these moral norms and part of what um leads 
up to this is before this time right and you    
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2158) know at least traditionally in the west and in 
many societies you you you have obviously the    
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2163) sexual act is at its core a reproductive act you 
know we can give sex different meanings you know    
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2169) we can we can engage in it for different reasons 
whether to exert power over someone or to you know    
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2175) as an expression of intimacy or love or pleasure 
or whatever right but in the end of the day you    
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2181) know mechanically speaking it's a reproductive 
act i'm talking about the full kind of act between    
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2185) a man and a woman and you know in traditionally 
especially before the birth control pill comes out    
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2190) in 1959 there isn't really a very foolproof way 
of of contraception so the idea is that if a man    
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2197) and woman are going to engage in intercourse then 
they are always running a fairly substantial risk    
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2202) of the natural consequences of the sex act which 
is which is pregnancy and conception and you know    
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2209) it doesn't make sense for any society to really 
have women you know giving birth to children left    
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2214) and right willy-nilly where we don't know their 
fathers who you know who's going to be responsible    
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2219) for them they don't have a lineage and so on 
and so forth girls are left to fend with these    
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2222) children on their fend for these children on their 
own anyway it's a big you know it undermines sort    
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2226) of the very basic structure of society which is 
based on the family right i mean the family is the    
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2232) absolute core uh institution in practically 
all human societies historically speaking    
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2237) anthropologically speaking and even in the modern 
west although it's been pretty much destroyed or    
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2242) very much you know undermined by this point but 
the idea is that sex because sex and reproduction    
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2247) were so tightly bound together they also were um 
confined at least you know officially so to speak    
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2254) the official morality and social norms they 
were confined to marriage to the marriage bed    
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2259) because the idea is that if people are going to 
engage in activity which could produce children    
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2263) they should only do that would only be 
morally responsible and acceptable to do so    
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2267) if they are in a situation where they are ready to 
receive that child right they can provide for it    
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2272) the it has a father to provide for it financially 
and mother to take care of it and so forth    
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2277) um otherwise to engage in this act which could 
bring about children it's a huge thing to conceive    
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2282) a child right without being properly prepared 
to do that is actually you know this is actually    
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2286) it's immoral it was considered immoral anti-social 
it it was a direct threat to the social fabric    
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2292) which it was because it undermines the family and 
so that's why things like premarital sex were you    
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2297) know so um so so taboo um again it happened 
but it was not the norm sometimes girls did    
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2304) get pregnant out of wedlock they would often 
disappear and quote unquote go visit grandma    
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2308) for six seven months you know and stay in a 
home somewhere and give birth to the baby and    
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2312) then give it up for adoption and come back home 
from visiting grandma you know seven months later    
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2316) and everyone kind of knew why and no one really 
said anything because it was a big big scandal    
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2319) right um so what happens uh so sex reproduction 
marriage as well as morality so religious morality    
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2326) you know also kind of undergirds this whole system 
it says because this is the nature of the sex act    
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2330) right which is based on the nature of the 
male and female bodies and so on and so forth    
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2334) moral norms are such that you know sex should be 
confined to a particular context and christianity    
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2339) is actually very specific and quite restrictive on 
that even more restrictive than islam as we'll see    
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2344) but christians are very very specific you know 
on this issue um and also in christianity not    
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2351) just catholicism which we know about today this 
is just the catholic position but until the 1930s    
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2356) you know all christian denominations catholic 
orthodox and protestant they were actually    
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2360) opposed to uh contraception because 
the idea was artificial contraceptives    
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2366) yes because the idea was that it would it 
was unnatural to artificially separate the    
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2371) sex act from its natural consequences which 
is uh possible reproduction and insemination    
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2377) and so in in the 1930s it was you know in america 
in the 1920s and in england and other places    
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2385) contraception was actually illegal it only 
became legal in the 30s and you had certain    
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2391) protestant denominations that came to accept it as 
a morally viable thing for christians to do i mean    
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2397) this is hard for us to imagine that you know even 
protestant mainline protestant christian churches    
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2401) did not accept even contraception here in the 
united states until 1965 contraception was    
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2407) illegal in the state of connecticut you cannot buy 
it right now again for us as muslims contraception    
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2412) is actually legal and you know for a married 
couple i mean sex is only legal for you know for    
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2417) a married couple to begin with but you know it is 
actually um you know we do have more latitude on    
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2423) that as muslims than the traditional christian 
position but at least in the west this kind of    
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2428) acceptance of artificial contraception is i guess 
the beginning you could say of this the beginning    
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2434) of the separation between kind of the sex act 
and what tends to be its natural outcome and then    
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2440) you know what kind of contraception did they 
have in the 1930s it wasn't necessarily that    
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2444) reliable yet condoms they were not very good but 
this the game changes radically in 1959 with the    
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2450) birth control pill so the birth control pill 
is first marketed maybe 58 but i believe 1959    
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2456) anyway um and for the first time people say aha 
now we have basically if you take it every day    
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2462) you know it's basically a full foolproof way 
of you know of birth control so now we can just    
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2467) now we can really kind of just separate sex from 
reproduction and if we can separate sex from    
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2473) reproductive consequences then why should it 
be confined to marriage anymore when those    
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2477) consequences are not necessarily there and so that 
old moral norm which demanded that these all be    
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2483) tightly you know bound together doesn't seem to 
make much sense to people anymore now i don't    
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2487) mean to imply that this was just because of the 
pill and birth control i mean obviously there's a    
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2491) lot more that drive social change and we're going 
to look at some of those factors also in a minute    
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2496) um this the the birth control pill became 
available all over the world not just in the west    
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2501) and it did not provoke we do not do not see a 
sexual revolution take place in the muslim world    
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2506) we did not see a sexual revolution take place 
in china for example right so in the west there    
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2510) were other uh major transformations that had taken 
place where all the dominoes were sort of in place  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2518) needed a final catalyst and this is 
very interesting about china because    
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2522) china is officially a communist state uh and so 
you'd expect perhaps that um a communist society    
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2528) would naturally ally itself to more libertarian 
and progressive movements like we have in the    
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2532) west but china is actually a very traditional 
society uh when it comes to gender relations and    
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2536) sexuality so um there has to be something else 
that's going on in the west so it's not just    
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2542) the advent of the pill and the availability of 
artificial conception there are other factors    
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2546) at play because these are all been available in 
china without the the social revolution that has    
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2552) has happened in the west and uh i think it's 
very interesting that a a communist society can    
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2556) still be very traditional and a a capitalist 
society in the west can be very uh extreme    
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2562) extremely individualist in its approach to 
relationships well capitalism and individualism    
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2566) anyway they go hand in hand from the beginning 
right so that that's uh and what you say is    
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2570) very true and also you know so i can stress that 
you know so far i've just given kind of purely    
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2574) sociological reasons as to why you know kind of 
premarital sex was considered so taboo before    
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2579) um but there's more to it than that i mean 
that's just a purely so that's on the purely    
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2582) sociological level it's a very important 
level it's also important in islam i mean    
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2585) the protection of lineage and families one of the 
central domains of the sharia we will see that in    
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2590) the future um but also there's there's just pure 
moral considerations right because what we do with    
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2596) our bodies the way we behave how we act it has an 
effect on our souls on our immaterial souls it has    
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2602) our effect on our human dignity it has an effect 
on our relationship with our creator right it goes    
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2608) beyond just pragmatic so because so much of this 
had taken a hit in the west in the traditional    
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2614) religious world we have been undermined right 
it seems at least the way i interpret it is that    
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2620) you know by the 1950s and 60s this sort of older 
morality was just hanging on by a thread and    
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2626) the only reason people didn't like burst through 
that door is because there was still this fear of    
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2629) pregnancy so we just all had to hold back but once 
the pill comes on okay now we can not worry about    
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2634) that anymore let's go ahead and just let loose 
whereas in other parts of the world okay the    
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2637) pill is available but still like in the muslim 
world at least when it comes to these types    
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2641) of issues there was still a much stronger 
sense of like propriety in terms of you know    
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2646) sexual behavior and family and so i mean family 
remains much more central and strong and so    
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2652) religious there's a theocentric emphasis obviously 
in islam towards the creator and in the west that    
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2658) has virtually well completely obviously vanished 
where there's a great emphasis on the dunya on the    
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2663) nafs on individual desires and and uh pleasures 
and so on so for me it's ultimately an existential    
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2670) and metaphysical question that uh about uh the 
distance of god and a religious vision of life    
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2676) and to whom one owes one's allegiance and one 
looks to you for guidance and and and how to    
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2681) live one's life and the west now has chosen 
uh completely irreligious secular path but    
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2687) of course muslims by definition haven't and they 
still retain that fundamental vision of life as    
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2692) orientated to the worship and following of god 
and of course that that is stable and enduring    
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2697) and leads to success in this life and the next 
the west doesn't it's a dead end i would argue    
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2701) it no longer has a vision to pursue anymore 
right that's very beautifully said mashallah    
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2707) very nicely said and i agree with i agree you 
know hundreds you're great that's good yes  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2713) um so great so moving on um  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2718) so um so what we see then so the separation 
of sex reproduction marriages was morality    
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2723) so these were tightly bound before both by you 
know kind of nature the nature of the act as    
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2726) well as you know by by morality but now as of 
the sexual revolution i always say the sexual    
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2731) revolution comes like like splits the atom and 
these three four things they just all take off    
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2736) in their own direction as free floating variables 
so sex is not just its own thing it's not tied to    
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2741) reproduction anymore not tied to marriage not tied 
to morality or what god has said or legislated    
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2746) right now we can make of it whatever we want okay 
um and so this is also important in the sexual    
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2753) revolution and we will see um in the next slide 
so this idea of separating these three things    
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2758) is very very important we're going to keep coming 
back to this over and over again over the course    
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2762) of the talk and also there are three other things 
which are separate which the west then amalgamates    
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2766) which is also very problematic and we'll see 
that and come back to it several times but    
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2769) we'll get to that in the next slide so what is 
the um what is the fallout of of of this um what    
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2776) is the fallout of this the sexual revolution 
we said um you know brings about basically a    
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2781) wholesale rejection of christian moral norms um 
for the first time it becomes people start openly    
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2787) when i was young they called it shacking up right 
which was a boy and a girl men and woman living    
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2792) together outside of marriage i mean i was young 
when that was still very very new and i remember    
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2796) people saying oh they're shacking up they're 
living in sin or oh you know it was something    
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2800) very novel still and many people were like opposed 
to it because i thought well that's not right and    
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2805) people used to think oh you know okay some 
people many people thought no you still have    
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2809) to be married have sex other people well no you 
don't have to be right they have to be in love    
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2812) and then other people you know and then slowly 
but surely like it doesn't even take that long you    
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2816) know marriage leads to quote-unquote just love and 
commitment love and commitment to well okay well    
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2820) as long as you consent to it no problem right so 
by the 80s or whatever you know you go like very    
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2826) slippery slope very quickly it's just like nothing 
matters anymore but consent as long as the people    
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2831) are not being forced and they consent there's no 
more uh specific moral code or any specific moral    
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2838) standards that apply to sexuality cross-sexuality 
right so there is no sexual morality at all    
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2844) anymore in the modern it's just consent which is 
complete a complete disaster and has nothing to    
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2849) do with islam i mean it's nothing the islamic 
paradigm is completely separate on this issue    
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2854) um but you know this is kind of the world that we 
are living in um okay and so what are some what is    
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2861) some of the fallout of this so we see uh in the 
wake of the sexual revolution we see a huge uh    
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2866) increase in divorce which also is very taboo in 
the west and in fact illegal also in some places  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2873) we forget how taboo divorce was and how rare 
it was he even within our own living memory but    
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2877) now it's kind of uh you know no fault divorce 
not a problem um they're almost the disposable    
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2884) relationships now and the idea you may go through 
serial monogamy as i as some people call it so    
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2889) we're against polygamy polygamy is a really bad 
thing but serial monogamy is okay so you're having    
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2895) multiple partners but just in a slightly different 
way but that's acceptable but polygamy isn't    
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2900) right and i remember again growing up just 
in the 80s you know i think when i was in    
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2903) third grade there was one kid in our class 
whose parents were divorced and that was like    
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2907) like a big deal like oh my gosh you know it was 
so rare and um you know 10 10 years later everyone    
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2913) else's parents were divorced too and then also 
you knew at that time right is children you know    
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2918) because of course with the sexual revolution part 
of it in the 60s was also second wave feminism and    
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2924) this push for women to leave the home and to 
you know sort of prioritize career over family    
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2928) and kind of um you know be on a par with men sort 
of in the public realm and so forth and what this    
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2933) led to is that now you have empty homes because 
the man is not working the woman's out working so    
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2937) for the first time on mass especially in like 
the middle classes and upper middle classes    
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2942) you know um of course you know in the poor 
classes women have always worked because    
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2946) they've had to but in these other classes where 
women you know before could stay home you know    
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2951) be supported um you find out children for the 
first time coming home now after school and no    
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2958) one's there we had a name for that back in the 
80s which was latchkey children and probably    
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2962) the younger members of our audience won't know 
that term but we knew that because that was a    
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2966) new thing again in the 80s latchkey kid was a kid 
who was dropped off by the school bus at 2 30 or 3    
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2972) and went home and actually had a key to his 
house and had to like open it on his own    
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2976) he's a lot because there's no mother there to 
well you know there's no mother in the home    
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2980) anymore so it's a latchkey kid and that lucky 
kid phenomenon was something very new anyway    
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2985) so you see also a huge uptick in uh divorce let 
me go back to my slide here um you see a huge    
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2993) uptick in divorce there's a demise of the nuclear 
family and this brings about with a huge social    
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=2997) dislocation so there's a a an immense rise in 
fatherlessness obviously when people divorce    
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3003) up you know they don't often stay in the same 
location men sometimes you know just abdicate    
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3008) all responsibility and take off they're not really 
bound anymore by that the merit to bond or legally    
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3012) bound to the woman and child other than to sort 
of pay you know alimony and child support but    
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3018) in terms of being present you know there's there 
many many homes don't have fathers and there have    
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3023) been so many studies on how disastrous it is for 
children both boys and girls not to have a father    
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3030) right and we live in a society which demonizes men 
right but men the presence of a man in the house    
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3037) nothing i mean some men are tyrants but in 
general the presence of the father in the home    
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3042) strong father figures very very critical for the 
health of children and the stability of children    
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3047) and therefore society right and so this rise in 
fatherlessness is correlated with the rise in    
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3053) delinquency um also of course a rise in single 
motherhood and then also single female poverty    
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3059) because it's these single mothers who are left 
with these kids who are often left fending for    
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3063) themselves working and trying to raise them at the 
same time without the help of a father um you know    
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3069) materially and also sometimes financially as well 
anyway so you have a lot of and so when you look    
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3074) at the you know are families perfect no are we 
saying that okay before the 1960s everything was    
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3079) hunky-dory never of course not i mean the idea is 
that the world is not perfect this is not genna    
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3084) it's not paradise but the question is what is the 
arrangement that is going to lead to the greatest    
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3089) amount of kind of human success possibility of 
human flourishing both again physically but also    
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3096) emotionally morally spiritually in this life 
and the next that's what islam is going for    
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3101) and the idea is that a strong stable family unit 
is absolutely critical for that it's critical for    
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3107) the stability of society and health of society 
in aggregate and for individuals and because    
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3112) sexuality is so tightly bound we'll see this later 
on too because it's so tightly bound to the family    
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3118) uh system that is why norms surrounding sexuality 
are so um stringent and really any society i mean    
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3125) i'd say sexuality is so central to who we are as 
human beings right and this is also a big part    
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3129) of the lgbt discord so central to who we are 
as human beings individually and collectively    
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3134) that no one is really no one is really um truly 
nonchalant about it whatever moral norms you or    
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3140) your society hold about uh sexual norms you tend 
to feel them very deeply and very viscerally    
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3147) so if you grow up in a you know a society where 
monogamy is the norm or you know heterosexual norm    
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3154) is is the norm and so forth like in the west until 
recently then you have like a very strong reaction    
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3158) against things like homosexuals just seem like 
very bizarre and very weird and very like wrong    
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3163) now if you grow up in the contemporary west where 
homosexuality and heterosexual have been equated    
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3170) and all of the relevant differences between them 
have been you know done away with or denied or    
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3175) whatever and you don't see why there should 
be a distinction you're going to feel really    
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3179) strong about why are you discriminating against 
you know same-sex relationships or but people    
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3184) tend to feel very strongly about it because sex 
is very important very powerful and it's very    
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3189) central to to human life it's not something 
that really any society including the mother    
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3193) and also i think that the new you you're 
not called it by its name wokism or the new    
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3197) i think it's a religion anyway it's not just an 
ideology it has the characteristics of a religion    
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3203) so it has its fundamental creed it has it has its 
uh sinful aberrations you're not allowed to commit    
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3209) heresy in other words disagree with it and so it's 
not just that sexual sex is a powerful emotive    
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3214) subject yes of course but also ideologically it 
has the characteristics of a religion with all    
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3220) that means for uh the other and the demonization 
of the heretic and and of course in a christian    
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3226) west a post-christian west what did you do with 
heretics you persecuted them or you executed them    
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3231) so that this kind of binary kind of thing is very 
strongly an american post-purist and culture i    
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3236) would argue there's also still here in england and 
in europe um you have this kind of quasi-religious    
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3243) uh impulse which is also infusing this 
wokism which i think is a quasi-religion    
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3248) right and you're right about that and there's a 
lot a lot can be said about i mean we could have    
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3252) a whole separate you know talk about that but but 
yes you're absolutely right and that that's a big    
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3258) big issue too that you know um that that really 
influences a lot the way this kind of discourse    
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3264) uh is deployed and and takes place in the current 
uh in the current scene so um yes so back now to    
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3272) this so all right so what does this have to do 
with lgbt right what does that have to do with    
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3276) lgbt so the idea is that you know it is in the 
midst of the sexual revolution and the rejection    
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3281) of the traditional norms and the breaking up 
of sex from reproduction marriage and morality    
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3285) it is in this sort of you know context that uh 
something like uh that that you see a rise in the    
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3292) visibility and prominence of homosexuality and gay 
rights or the gay rights of the you know the gay    
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3297) liberation movement which basically rides on the 
coattails of the sexual revolution because again    
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3302) think about it if sex is now its own thing and 
it's not necessarily tied to reproduction marriage    
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3307) and religious morality then again so what is it 
about what's about pleasure it's about you know    
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3312) relationships it's about fulfillment it's about 
romance it's about you know a lot of other things    
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3317) and if that's really what it's about and not about 
these other things then okay well two men can love    
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3322) each other or two women and you know all of those 
other things they seem to apply more on a par    
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3325) right if you take the reproductive and the 
family and the more traditional moral moral    
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3330) morality aspect out of it all of a sudden you know 
homosexual heterosexual relations seem to be much    
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3335) more commensurate and so people start to see well 
okay well why should we accept one and reject the    
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3340) other and then of course it was closed in terms of 
okay this is a minority statistical minority and    
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3345) on the right the the also coattails of the civil 
rights movement especially in the united states    
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3350) with you know african-americans black americans 
and so forth the idea was okay well we're a    
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3354) minority too and we'll get to this later because 
there's an equivalency that's very strong and this    
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3358) is part of wokism specifically you have gender you 
have race gender and sexual orientation sexuality    
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3365) right lgbt and these are all equated and this is 
something which again for us as muslims these are    
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3371) all three completely separate things i mean race 
is one thing and the way the religion approaches    
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3375) it is like very one way gender is very different 
from race and sexuality and sexual or sorry like    
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3381) sexual behavior which is what this shadow is 
concerned about here is completely different so    
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3386) these are three completely different things that 
have literally nothing to do with each other but    
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3390) in the contemporary west they're all just thrown 
together as like minority rights i mean women    
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3394) are not a minority but like say you know you have 
racial minorities sexual minorities and the women    
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3399) you know the ideas that okay historically you know 
they've been sort of the underclass and so all of    
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3403) these are sort of three underdog classes and and 
and so they're all equated and you're either on    
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3410) board for justice and for everybody or or you're 
just incoherent at best and immoral and bigoted at    
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3416) worst and again this is not a paradigm that's 
really going to work at all um from a muslim    
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3421) perspective and we'll see this as we as we go on 
but it's important to realize that again that's a    
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3424) very very strong motif in our contemporary society 
so all of this of course puts all traditional    
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3430) religious believers in a difficult position i put 
traditional in there because you know in the wake    
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3434) of the sexual revolution many many denominations 
of mainstream uh protestant christianity in the    
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3440) west as well as you know uh certainly reformed 
judaism as well as you know conservative judaism    
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3445) which isn't really all that conservative you know 
have have really taken on the basic assumptions    
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3450) of the sexual revolution in terms of gender norms 
gender equality also in terms of you know um the    
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3456) sort of elective nature of sex that you know we do 
have the right to just kind of you know have sex    
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3462) whoever whenever we want as long as it's 
you know consensual and so forth and    
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3466) and so um but i'm talking about traditional uh 
religious believers so traditional catholics    
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3470) traditional orthodox christians as well as 
traditional protestants evangelicals and others    
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3475) and muslims as a whole you know have not really 
conceded as a body and so muslims are sort of    
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3480) um i always say i mean islam altogether 
is orthodox more or less i mean    
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3484) the mainstream mainstream islam is orthodox which 
is not necessarily the case at least in the west    
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3490) in some of these other traditions although it 
is outside of the west and that's why you see    
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3494) the church of england and the episcopalian 
church which is the american branch of the    
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3497) church of england has really been split apart on 
this issue because they have so many bishops that    
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3503) come from africa where again socially speaking 
like they're just not on board with this and they    
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3507) have a different social context they did not go 
the sexual revolution is very specific to western    
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3512) culture it's not a global phenomenon and so those 
bishops are like forget it we're not endorsing gay    
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3518) bishops and homosexual marriages in our churches 
in africa like you've got to be crazy and you have    
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3522) your northern european swedes and england and 
you know oh but for them you know again they're    
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3528) kind of in having a completely different universe 
which has been brought about precisely by you know    
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3533) the sexual revolution and so they say no but this 
is fundamentally unjust and it's discriminatory    
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3538) and again it's just it's totally in 
commensurate the paradigms it's just like    
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3542) talking right past each other and this is really 
why it's so important to have this conversation    
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3547) um so okay so moving right along so this slide 
we're gonna see it again so i'm just gonna go    
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3553) very quickly but it's something i want people to 
really take home with them i think it's really    
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3557) critical if you get this slide you can it's the 
key to unlocking the whole conundrum that we're in    
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3563) so modern western i should say contemporary 
western culture right modern is like a long    
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3567) period contemporaries just right now and this 
is all very new separates three things that are    
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3572) inherently inex bound up to each other and should 
be by nature and by religious law we would say as    
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3578) muslims right allah created us as human beings 
he created nature endowed with a purpose he also    
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3584) you know legislates morality and so these are 
coherent and in tune with each other and by    
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3589) both the nature of reality and by religious 
law and norms sex reproduction marriage and    
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3595) morality should be bound together now i want 
to say that also as muslims we do not you know    
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3601) islam is the middle position and i think 
from a muslim perspective perspective    
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3605) uh chris traditional christianity is a you know 
comes across as a very what they call sex negative    
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3611) religion you have augustine in the fourth century 
right who was a licentious man before he became    
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3616) a christian but once he became a christian he was 
so disgusted with his previous life of profligacy    
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3621) that he became he took a very very negative view 
towards the body towards sexuality also the very    
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3627) heavy platonic and neoplatonic influence which 
also very much downplayed kind of the materiality    
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3633) in favor of pure spirituality and so christianity 
yeah i think right augustine is much more    
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3638) influenced by neo patternism of the hellenistic 
greek philosophy than by the hebrew bible which    
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3644) doesn't have any of these inhibitions the hebrew 
scriptures the jewish bible in other words doesn't    
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3648) have any of these sex negative i mean the the 
song of songs for example in the old testament is    
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3653) is very erotic actually almost obscenes for some 
people but for him he was much more influenced    
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3659) by greek philosophy which uh with with his denial 
of the of the body uh seeing the body as a prison    
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3665) uh and so to be really close and transcendent you 
had to uh deny the carnal nature the sinful nature    
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3673) which inevitably meant um sexuality so yeah ab 
absolutely right and augustine's influence over    
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3678) the western church has been phenomenal absolutely 
phenomenal right and it's very important because    
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3684) you know again i think so islam you know sort 
of understands itself and has been understand as    
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3688) muslims as being a middle path and you know this 
sort of you know traditional christian view i mean    
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3692) augustine said sex was basically a unnecessary 
evil so it's intrinsically evil because it's of    
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3698) the flesh and the flesh is is fallen right and 
carnal you know desires where the trouble began    
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3704) with back in the garden with adam and eve and 
you know anyway all of the influences that you    
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3708) also just mentioned it's so it's evil in and of 
itself but it's necessary for the propagation of    
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3712) the species and according to augustine too even 
a married couple should not enjoy they should    
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3716) try to enjoy it as little as possible it's like 
just do what you have to do to like make sure    
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3720) the species goes on but you should try to enjoy 
it as low as you can so there's nothing in islam    
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3725) like this in fact sexuality i mean islam has been 
considered traditionally a sex positive religion    
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3730) and by that i mean it doesn't look that way from 
the modern stereotype that contemporary westerners    
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3735) have um but that's also because the contemporary 
west has gone from one extreme to quite the other    
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3740) extreme probably in reaction to the first extreme 
partially in reaction to it but also part of other    
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3745) factors that we'll talk about shortly um but you 
know islam has never i mean sexuality itself has    
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3750) always been considered something pure good 
you know holy if you want to put it that way    
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3754) but but but but in its proper context i 
mean so islam is very very strict about    
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3759) you know illicit sex and it takes a very strong 
position against it but within the proper context    
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3765) which is basically the context of marriage between 
a man man and a woman right that in that context    
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3771) it's actually considered an act of worship and 
the prophet as as we know peace be upon him    
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3775) he said to his companions you will be rewarded for 
you know for coming unto your wives and they said    
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3781) they were surprised by this and they said what why 
would we be why would we be rewarded for simply    
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3786) uh taking care of our desires and he said did 
do you not see that if you were to take care    
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3791) of your desires in an illegal way that 
you would be punished and they said yes    
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3795) and he said well therefore if you do it in a 
permissible way then you will be rewarded right    
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3800) so you actually get reward and so you know having 
relations with one spouse is considered an act of    
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3805) worship one is supposed to be in a state of ritual 
purity although the act itself vitiates the ritual    
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3810) purity but you're supposed to get into a state of 
ritual purity before because it's as if it's an    
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3813) act of worship and in islam even the sunnah at 
the moment of climax will just be explicit one    
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3818) should say allahu akbar right which is to remember 
god because it's his blessing that one is able to    
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3824) experience this and our scholars consider that a 
foretaste of the pleasure of paradise because it's    
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3829) the greatest physical pleasure at least that 
that human beings typically can experience in    
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3833) this world and for many people especially even 
post-christian westerners it's just completely    
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3840) you know um they can't wrap their mind around 
okay maybe we're cool with sex today we don't    
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3846) have these hang-ups but we've also thrown 
off christianity but if you want to tell me    
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3849) i should remember god while i'm having an orgasm 
i'm sorry like that just doesn't compute you know    
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3854) yeah for even a modern again post-christians like 
religion is here and sex is there and it's i mean    
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3861) whenever the twin shall meet the largest 
church in the world is the catholic church and    
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3864) all of the leaders of the catholic church are 
celibate men uh that they've never had they    
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3870) just don't do this at all it's completely 
so that's even now even though the church    
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3874) is more sex positive it's still in practice is 
led by celibate people people who've renounced    
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3880) uh sexuality completely and compare that with the 
the prophet of islam upon whom be peace who had a    
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3885) number of wives and and he had the teaching as 
you just said it's it's integrated in a very    
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3889) positive way in the life of muslims right and 
also you know it's important to know so celibacy    
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3894) has always been considered a very high calling in 
christianity now christians have understood that    
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3899) it's not for everybody in fact it's not most 
people's calling because it's very difficult    
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3903) right but if you are able to do and if you are 
quote-unquote called to you have a vocation to    
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3907) celibacy that's considered very very high and 
that's why the religious leaders are expected to    
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3912) to sort of rise to that vocation of course the 
central figures you have the virgin mary whom    
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3917) we also believe as muslims was a virgin when 
she gave birth miraculously to jesus even if    
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3921) she married thereafter so she's a central figure 
and then jesus himself you know we don't as far    
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3927) as we know never married so he was presumably 
a virgin too i mean because he never married    
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3932) so your two central figures are people who were 
you know sexually celibate at least marry until    
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3937) these are role models of a christian role model 
jesus and mary are role models and both of them    
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3942) uh it would seem were completely celebrated so you 
know and very interestingly the quran affirms mary    
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3950) in her miraculous conception of jesus as a virgin 
but it doesn't say that she remained a virgin and    
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3957) the new testament doesn't say it either it doesn't 
mean it's jess actually that she went on to have    
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3961) many children because jesus had many brothers and 
sisters biological not just an extended sense but    
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3966) in the right biological yes through her right 
and i'm not aware that muslim sources you know    
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3972) think believe that jesus got married either 
so we probably believe that he didn't i mean    
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3976) i don't know if i've never heard anything to the 
contrary but nevertheless right and although jesus    
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3982) of course is very very highly you know one of the 
greatest prophets in islam right you have the five    
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3987) noah abraham moses jesus muhammad peace be upon 
all of them are the five greatest um never i mean    
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=3992) the quran explicitly repudiates the christian 
idea of uh of uh monasticism it says the prophet    
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4002) islam there is no monasticism 
or religion and allah allah  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4010) uh you know monasticism which they uh um that 
they innovated that they introduced as a as a    
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4016) um no divine warrant for it yeah exactly as a 
reprehensible innovation and religion that we    
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4022) meaning god did not prescribe upon them so anyway 
so islam you know you also find like obviously    
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4027) descriptions of paradise in the quran do very 
strongly suggest that you know um people will have    
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4033) enjoy sexual congress in paradise in addition 
to the other types of bodily pleasures that are    
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4037) mentioned like eating and drinking various you 
know delicious fruits and foods and reclining on    
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4043) uh you know um on sofas of silk and so on and so 
forth and then the greatest uh the greatest uh    
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4050) uh pleasure of paradise of course 
is the vision of god himself right    
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4053) but nevertheless the quran you know doesn't really 
have a fundamental problem with these sort of the    
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4059) physical aspect of being but it brings it under 
the divine law and the divine ruling and it    
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4064) dignifies and sanctifies it by making these 
bodily functions so to speak um a concern    
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4071) you know part of the divine concern shall we say 
so islam kind of some have said that you know i    
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4077) remember christopher hitchens once said oh islam 
is very grubby it's like kind of in the dirt he    
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4081) said i mean he was an atheist but he was very 
anti-islamic you know i mean he was i remember    
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4086) he's very pro-bosnian back at the time of the war 
but so but you know that was not a religion he was    
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4091) very critical of the islamic religion um but but 
what he meant he says it sounds like very earthy    
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4097) and i i think even though he's an atheist 
he's still coming from this kind of christian    
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4101) background and what he doesn't realize that for a 
muslim perspective islam is actually you know the    
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4106) the companions they the the disbeliever that the 
mecca said oh your prophet even teaches you how    
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4111) to go to the bathroom because in islam we have to 
clean ourselves a particular way use water and so    
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4115) on and so forth like you don't just do it any 
way which way because cleanliness and the love    
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4119) of women and iman cleanliness is part of faith 
and so the disbelievers made fun of the muslims    
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4123) like what kind of prophet is even teaching you how 
to clean yourselves and he said yes that's right    
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4127) he teaches us even how to clean ourselves because 
this becomes also an act now that is endowed with    
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4132) significance because there's a proper way to do it 
there's a sunnah behind it a way of following the    
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4136) prophetic guidance and this is what guidance is 
all that's comprehensive and so you have this um    
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4142) you know notion that these bodily functions they 
have to be of course trained and they have to be    
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4148) um schooled and they have to be reined in and 
they have to be directed in the proper way but    
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4152) they are not in and of themselves wrong or bad and 
that's why you have muslim scholars with no qualms    
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4158) whatsoever talking about you know these things 
in paradise and even writing some of the great    
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4163) scholars i mean i'm kind of going a little off 
topic but again i think it's important for us to    
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4167) realize from a a large person because we will be 
told that we're prudes if you're not on board with    
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4173) the lgbt then you guys are just repressing this no 
no no islam very much throughout its history you    
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4178) know it's been very open we have major scholars of 
the religion who also wrote basically sex manuals    
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4184) i mean you know uh not just about you know the 
rulings of it but how to actually pleasure your    
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4189) spouse and yourself in different positions and 
so on and so forth written by religious scholars    
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4194) you know this is good part of their scholarly 
output is a completely legitimate you know uh    
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4200) uh subject of inquiry no problem whatsoever but 
within the proper context so islam has always    
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4206) had that middle i think the chris christian 
perspective was so anti-body anti-sex anti you    
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4212) know also i think maybe you know quite anti-woman 
in a lot of respects too with you know eve was the    
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4218) one who brought sin into the world and so forth 
there's nothing equivalent like that and it's not    
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4222) right that it went from that to like you know sort 
of the other extreme and we see that now but you    
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4228) know as muslims i think again muslims especially 
in the current western environment where we are    
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4232) and we are compared to the current environment 
we are very strict and quote-unquote like prude    
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4237) i mean prude it doesn't necessarily have to be a 
bad word but very restrained and we have a we have    
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4241) a stern sexual morality absolutely it's central 
to our religion but that just means that sexual    
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4246) has to take place in the right context and we're 
very very insistent upon that but in that context    
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4252) it's it's it's a fine thing it's a good thing 
it's nothing to be ashamed of and that's the    
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4256) proper balance you know that is that's what we 
would say as muslims is is the proper balance    
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4262) um all right so moving right along so you have 
this separation right of sex reproduction in    
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4268) marriage we'll see this again and also now 
going coming back specifically to the lgbt    
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4273) issue and we'll see this again too i'll go into 
much more detail that while it separates these    
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4278) three things which are by nature and in moral 
law and religious you know prescription tightly    
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4284) bound to to each other it also um it also uh 
amalgamates or puts together three things that    
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4291) ought to be rigorously separate and 
which were separate before in which    
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4295) contemporary western culture study in the 
late 19th century started to put together    
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4299) namely desires actions and identity and desires 
particularly same-sex desires desire you know    
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4306) homosexual desires and when i say desires 
and actions are put together what i mean    
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4310) by that is that you know because morality is 
thrown out the window now religious morality    
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4314) the actions are seen to flow from the desire the 
presence of the desire is sort of where we start    
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4319) and then if the desire is present as long as 
everyone consents right then the action naturally    
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4323) flows from it it's unobjectionable morally because 
it's simply responding to the desire and there's    
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4328) no consideration on the basis of which the action 
should be repudiated in a moral sense right so you    
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4333) have desires actions flow from it and then this 
is key this is absolutely critical we'll see this    
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4338) you know in a future slide that on top of this 
is built now an entire personal identity and this    
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4344) starts in the late 19th century 1860 or so the 
word homosexual is coined in german homosexuality    
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4350) and then it's taken that's actually you know a 
greek borrowing but anyway it was coined first in    
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4355) the german environment and then taken into other 
languages in the same form essentially um and    
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4361) uh i mean there's a german word for it but they 
coined it with that greek um anyway and so and so    
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4368) only quite recently in western society have 
people started to see themselves in terms of    
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4373) having a sexual identity and again very important 
because anyone who grows up in the modern world    
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4379) will take it for granted oh you're gay or straight 
or gay straight or bi or you know and i read also    
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4384) everyone has asexuality right which is your 
sexuality well no this idea of asexuality like ity    
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4391) you know um as an abstract noun this is also a 
new coinage like what is sexuality how do you say    
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4395) that in arabic like or other languages you know 
i mean it's a new thing so the idea that even a    
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4400) hundred years ago or 110 20 years ago in the west 
if you were to ask an average person on the street    
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4405) are you straight they would have said what do 
you mean am i straight like they wouldn't have    
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4408) even identified as being quote unquote straight no 
one really identified in terms of being either gay    
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4413) or straight for us again it's so ingrained that 
you're either one or the other or somewhere in    
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4418) between so you're bi but you are have to be either 
gay straight or bi well how come no other culture    
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4424) even has words you know that that that corresponds 
any of this because they didn't have the concept    
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4429) you know sexual behavior was something you did 
it was not something you were and we'll see this    
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4434) very important right even i mean people have 
been engaged in such same-sex behavior i mean    
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4440) in it it's attested in throughout history and we 
can see it and we know it goes back at least to    
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4446) the time of the people of lut right and it's in 
greek culture you find it also in muslim culture    
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4450) um you know uh if you look at the actual 
what you know culture of course it existed    
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4455) it's it's practically universal not totally but 
practically universal there seem to be some tribes    
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4459) that don't have a concept of same-sex behavior but 
it seems to be quite rare um but the idea is that    
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4466) this was something someone these were some things 
things that people did it's not something you were    
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4471) and the uh the analogy would be other sexual 
behaviors for us today as modern modernized or    
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4477) modern westernized peoples right someone may or 
may not engage in x act or why act or i don't    
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4483) know masturbation or something like that and you 
know whether you do or not it's like something    
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4486) you either do or you don't do it's not something 
you are and you would never think of identifying    
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4491) yourself based on do you do this particular act or 
not and we say yeah but homosexuality is different    
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4495) well yeah it's different to you because it's been 
constructed that way in your particular cultural    
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4500) media at this time and place but even in the west 
until quite recently no one thought in terms of    
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4506) you know of sexual there was no such thing as a 
sexual identity it's all very new and it's all    
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4510) very culturally contingent historically and 
culturally contingent it's very important for    
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4515) muslims to understand because forces in the west 
right are they present this as something that    
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4521) is is universal that is just natural that is just 
the way things are and if you're not on board with    
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4527) this then you are simply you know you're unnatural 
like you're going against just how things are and    
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4533) you're denying reality and you say listen i mean 
you can only go back a little bit and even in your    
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4539) own culture you have no such conception of this 
and so by what fiat you know by what right do    
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4544) you sort of you know have the fiat to just say 
well this is now a universal truth okay anyway    
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4551) let's let's go on because we have a lot to do 
and we want to make sure we can get through this    
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4556) so very quickly so the sexual revolution i said 
is the most important kind of and you know the    
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4560) most proximate cause of where we are today but the 
sexual revolution itself has antecedents and again    
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4566) important for us as muslims you know we're trying 
to get a a large uh conceptual and historical uh    
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4571) view of the issue so that we can understand 
them in their proper context and as deeply    
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4575) and as accurately as possible so sexual revolution 
has antecedents right this goes back to you could    
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4581) say the rise of sort of the modern period means 
15 16th century 17th century particularly with    
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4587) the scientific revolution again i'm not going to 
say much on this i have i mean at the bottom of    
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4591) this slide you're going to see a talk i've given 
on these things in much more detail so i'll refer    
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4595) you to that but with the scientific revolution in 
17th century you have the rise of a materialistic    
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4600) mechanical view of the world right the world is 
now seen as just being this kind of clock ticking    
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4605) along material stuff out there and one of the um 
one of the results of this is that god essentially    
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4611) is cut off from his creation i mean not really 
of course because if we're not for god's will the    
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4615) whole creation would you know uh uh cease to exist 
in in the blink of an eye but in people's minds    
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4621) right in their world view they no longer see god's 
hand in his creation right whereas before there    
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4627) there you know things were created with a purpose 
and they were given a teleology a purpose by god    
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4632) and they were seen to have a particular nature 
that was imbued you know through divine agency and    
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4636) so forth um you know the universe as a whole as 
well as human beings collectively and individually    
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4642) and this starts to fall by the wayside in the 
western consciousness with the rise of a kind    
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4646) of materialistic and mechanical worldview so you 
have a loss of inherent meaning and purpose right    
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4650) and this is important because if there's 
no meaning out there in the world there's    
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4654) no intrinsic meaning no inherent meaning and 
there's no inherent meaning in human existence    
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4659) or my personal existence then either you live in 
a world without meaning which is one of the main    
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4665) themes of modernity you know how do we grapple 
with kind of the meaninglessness of it all which    
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4669) is why i have so much absurd art and pessimistic 
art because people are really staring this    
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4674) meaningless meaningless base right so either there 
is no meaning or whatever meaning there is because    
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4680) there's no meaning out there that's been put in it 
by a creator god the only meaning that there could    
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4684) be is something that's self-generated i generate 
the meaning and i impose a meaning and that goes    
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4688) back to why we say now as of the sexual revolution 
okay the male body and female body they don't mean    
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4693) anything anymore there's no inherent you know 
comple it's obvious that they're meant to be    
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4697) complementary i mean just you know a five-year-old 
could tell you that just look at the bot one body    
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4701) and the other it's clear that what was meant to 
go where and how it's all supposed to fit together    
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4707) but the idea is that there is no more you know 
this is there this is not seen as like intended    
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4713) or or endowed with like an inherent purposefulness 
or teleology or nature that you know that to    
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4720) violate would be a moral violation right your 
body is just stuff and you inhabit it as this    
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4727) immaterial mind and it's up to you to like you 
know run your stuff however you want do with    
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4732) your stuff whatever you want and to give whatever 
meaning to your stuff and what you do with it that    
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4737) you want to right so you're just sovereign to kind 
of impart meanings and this is totally different    
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4742) from the pre-modern worldview completely you know 
alien to the islamic worldview obviously right    
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4748) but this is sort of very central to the modern 
consciousness um so that's 17. now if we go into    
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4753) the 18th century of the enlightenment right and 
the enlightenment is basically puts human reason    
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4758) in the center and makes it the standard of all 
knowledge including moral knowledge now what falls    
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4763) by the wayside here revelation revelation gets 
discredited we're talking about specifically the    
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4768) bible because that's revelation for the west was 
the the bible the christian and jewish scriptures    
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4772) this is discredited for you know higher biblical 
criticism very important here i know you've had    
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4777) many uh guests on on here who are world experts 
who have discussed that issue um also you know    
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4782) geological findings which were incompatible with 
a um you know a straightforward reading of genesis    
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4788) the timeline of genesis darwinism in the 19th 
century is a major secularizing factor although    
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4793) it doesn't necessarily entail uh you know atheism 
nevertheless socially speaking sociologically    
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4800) speaking there's no doubt that that you know 
darwin's theory of evolution had a massive    
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4804) impact on the kind of loss of meaning and sort 
of religious sense sentiment in the west there's    
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4810) a book written by uh owen chadwick um i believe a 
british scholar so he's a professor at cambridge    
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4816) i think yeah the secularization of the european 
mind in the 19th century so it's really the 19th    
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4821) century where the all of this stuff trickles down 
and the average everyday person in the west mind    
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4828) becomes secularized and so at the beginning of the 
century of the 19th century you cannot be hired in    
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4832) a university to teach if you're an atheist who 
would hire an atheist to teach people in the    
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4837) university you know it's just considered so you 
know deviant and and you know immoral where do you    
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4842) get your morals from you don't believe in god you 
don't believe in an afterlife how can we trust you    
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4846) and by the end of the century you have nietzsche 
famously declaring again blasphemous from a muslim    
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4851) perspective quote unquote god is dead right in in 
the space of 50 60 years right so anyway that's    
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4858) jumping ahead so 19th century so then we so we 
have uh the rise of the materialistic mechanical    
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4863) worldview um pursuant to the scientific revolution 
yet the enlightenment of the 18th century then    
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4867) liberalism you know all of these are humongous 
topics obviously i'm just giving a very very quick    
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4872) you know overview liberalism in the 18th 19th 
century classical liberalism liberalism it sees    
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4877) it puts a premium on human individual freedom 
and personal autonomy and this in a sense makes    
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4883) sense okay if there's no god anymore really in 
our consciousness and the world is just there    
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4886) now man rises to the top right this is kind of the 
deification of man so we are at the center we are    
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4893) sovereign we can rule the world we're no longer 
standing under a god the world is not standing    
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4899) we are the masters we're in control and we demand 
absolute you know maximum freedom and and autonomy    
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4905) as a species to do whatever we want you know 
to the planet with the planet whatever and also    
[1:21:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4909) in our own societies to um you know structure 
them the way we want in our own lives as well    
[1:21:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4915) we have this ultimate freedom and autonomy so 
freedom of course everyone you know um appreciates    
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4920) freedom when you talk about political freedom 
from tyranny and so forth and oppression of course    
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4924) but the modern psyche has a very particular notion 
of freedom which is much goes well beyond that    
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4930) it's almost a fetishization i am here i am born 
to be absolutely as free as possible from all    
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4936) external constraints be they moral constraints 
religious constraints the ties of family the ties    
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4941) of tradition the ties of society right every you 
know such tie is just a barrier that is meant for    
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4948) me to break in order to actualize my own self 
so the self actualization is self realization    
[1:22:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4955) and we'll see again a little bit more in detail 
where this comes from this is absolutely critical    
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4959) and this is very deeply embedded in current 
discourses surrounding sexuality in general in    
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4965) the west and homosexuality and lgbt in particular 
and again these assumptions lie so deep beneath    
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4971) the surface that we are really not aware of their 
presence because they're they're so buried and    
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4976) they've impacted our psyche so much that we just 
oh of course like that's just natural you just    
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4981) think that's the way the world has always been 
that's the only way to see it you don't realize    
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4985) that this is actually just a particular way i see 
the sun reverberating on my face so excuse me um    
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4993) so you have that and then again i i will refer you 
to a lecture i gave uh that goes into this in a    
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=4998) lot more detail it's called negotiating paradigms 
islam in the modern world view every blue uh title    
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5003) you see in this presentation is a hyperlink so um 
again i this slide deck will be available to you    
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5010) and you can just click on the uh on the blue 
links and they will take you directly to uh    
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5016) what they're connected to um sexual revolution 
antecedent very very quickly um there's a great    
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5021) book that came out in 2020 the rise and 
triumph of the modern self by carl truman    
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5027) there's a subtitle which is quite long it's 
something like cultural amnesia expressive    
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5032) individualism and the the sexual revolution 
something like that so quite a jawbreaker yeah    
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5039) exactly so this is a very very good book and also 
just this year i mean literally in march he came    
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5045) out with a abridged version of it called strange 
new world but if you can read the original i would    
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5050) definitely do this maybe 400 and some pages it's 
quite a thick tone very very well done but for    
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5056) more of a lay audience so to speak i mean there 
is a 180 page kind of uh you know digest of it if    
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5063) you want with the main points uh and so i'm taking 
this you know uh what i'm presenting on this slide    
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5068) is is taken from uh from truman so he traces back 
to russo jean-jacques russo who of course is a    
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5076) geneva swiss uh um uh uh philosopher and man of 
letters uh of the 18th century so his dates are    
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5083) 17 12 to 78 and very quickly so locates identity 
in the inner psychological life of the individual    
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5092) so this is what truman says is the beginning of 
the psychologization of the human being right    
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5097) so um for who so feelings are central to who we 
are does that sound familiar to anyone it's like    
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5103) this is the air we breathe authenticity another 
very important word for the modern individual    
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5108) authenticity is tied to the outward expression 
of inner feelings right so who i am is not you    
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5115) know the role i play in society which in other 
society okay i'm a father i'm a husband i'm a son    
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5119) who i am is the roles i play no who i am 
is my own private personal kind of inner    
[1:25:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5125) feelings that's the primary locus of who i am 
and to be authentic means that i live outwardly    
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5131) exactly in accord with my inner feelings now you 
can say fine but your enough feelings need to be    
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5136) controlled and they need to be you know um 
again uh um uh molded and they need to be    
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5142) shaped and they need to be trained right and and 
probably would have agreed with that but again the    
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5147) seeds get set and then as this idea develops it 
becomes more and more like whatever i feel inside    
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5152) is who i truly am deep down and for me to live 
authentically i must be able to live outwardly    
[1:25:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5159) how i feel inwardly and any discrepancy between 
the two is a lack of my proper self realization    
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5166) it's a lack of my becoming fully the human i am 
supposed to be or i am deep down and you can hear    
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5173) in this resonances of what we hear around us 
today especially in with transgenderism right    
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5178) okay i have a male body but i i am a woman not i 
feel like i'm a woman but i'm not so i feel like    
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5184) that way there's there's an issue but i actually 
am a woman because if i feel like i'm a woman    
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5189) yeah right you could say but wait 
a minute but you've got a male body    
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5192) so are you a woman or a man well this is a 
metaphysical question people have to realize this    
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5196) it's a metaphysical question what role does the 
body have to play in the definition of who you are    
[1:26:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5203) and what role does the mind the inner subjective 
self play right is it all the physical and the    
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5209) psychology means absolutely nothing is it all 
psychology and the body means nothing is it both    
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5213) these are metaphysical questions and the fact that 
we have gone from you know in just a couple years    
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5219) especially on the transgender issue you know 10 
years ago gender identity disorder that's what    
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5224) it was called that means if you have a male body 
and you feel like you're a female or vice versa    
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5229) then you have a disorder now we're not blaming 
you morally for that because it's a disorder    
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5234) okay you couldn't help it but people recognize 
there's a disorder it's not supposed to be the    
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5238) case quote unquote if you're have a male body 
you should identify as a man and feel like a    
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5242) man and if you don't okay there's a disorder 
there we need to try to figure out what to do    
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5246) right that then changes to gender dysphoria 
dysphoria just means okay i'm uncomfortable    
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5251) with it so it's no longer a question of you're 
objectively like out of kilter or off kilter    
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5257) out of sync with your biology and that's a problem 
because you're supposed to be one integrated    
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5261) person right it's it now becomes okay dysphoria 
well if you're if you're um uh uh troubled by that    
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5270) or uncomfortable okay then you've 
got dysphoria will try to help you    
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5273) and now just a couple years later even saying 
gender dysphoria is considered offensive to many    
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5277) in these movements and the idea is like no i am 
a woman or i am a man in the wrong body period    
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5284) right and the body's wrong the body means 
nothing the objective kind of physiology    
[1:28:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5289) it doesn't matter it's all the psychology it's all 
so it's it's a the maximum and so truman will say    
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5295) well this is i mean jose would have been aghast i 
mean probably but he would say this is kind of the    
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5301) ultimate you know logical outcome of this 
idea of making the internal you know given    
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5308) such primacy to the internals this is not really 
new in the west we have this idea of dualism    
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5313) which goes back to the ancient greeks where the 
the idea is you have the body and the soul and the    
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5318) soul is preeminently important that's the precious 
thing that's that that's the soul is that which    
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5323) you gain knowledge of the divine and become divine 
in a way and the body is seen as like a prisons uh    
[1:28:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5329) it's called a prison in plasonic so this is the 
old old hoary notion of dualism which goes back    
[1:28:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5335) to the ancient greeks resurfacing post-renaissance 
in rousseau and his thinking but it's not really    
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5341) new it is a fundamental category that we see 
much earlier in in greek thought resurfacing    
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5347) in the modern world and it's very contrary 
to the abrahamic face the hebrew bible for    
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5351) example has a much more um integrated holistic 
understanding of the human being as being uh    
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5358) ones a part soul heart mind part body not as 
jewelers dualism where it splits apart so i think    
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5366) we're seeing some deep western tributaries here 
surfacing up again in the modern times which are    
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5372) not really new i mean okay they have certain new 
configurations but the fundamental metaphysical    
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5378) duality is there a thousand over millennia i 
would argue right and again and again i think    
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5384) that's a great point and i think you know really 
like the arabs there's nothing new under the sun    
[1:29:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5390) you know like it's the fr m shows right i mean 
it's there there's not really nothing new i mean    
[1:29:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5395) all of these ideas atheism is all you know just 
recycled from like this office and ancient you    
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5400) know but it takes a different guy so you're right 
that you have that dualism but i think it's given    
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5404) a specific um valence in the modern period that 
you know it becomes sort of this very specific    
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5410) outgrowth so to say of something that had seeds 
there before but was also kind of um balanced out    
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5415) by other types of considerations which fell by the 
wayside and you get this kind of ex ex crescents    
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5421) right this outgrowth of of of this kind of like 
very radical internalization and subjectivization    
[1:30:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5429) and personalization and individualization of 
the notion of the human being right and this    
[1:30:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5434) is absolutely fundamental to the moderate and this 
is at the base of people saying well this is who i    
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5439) am right it's not just sexuality right the 
idea is because you're not anything other    
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5443) than your internal feelings and if you're going 
to deny me that well then you're denying me my  
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5455) is that we've because we've been here before in 
some ways yes there are unique configurations as    
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5459) you say the west keeps on having to go over the 
same ground over and over again and relearning    
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5464) the same lessons it doesn't it's not there's no 
stability or continuity in the western tradition    
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5470) it's this complex uh composite of different 
traditions pagan christian jewish uh and    
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5476) so on and they keep on throwing up the same 
paradigms and we have to go through the same    
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5480) heartache and catastrophe again and again 
learning the same lesson and it's obviously    
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5486) uh presents uh it presents itself as a final 
dispensation but events it offers stability    
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5491) and kind of divine wisdom in the social order so 
we don't have to keep on searching for solutions    
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5496) to these problems we've got the perfect template 
which is impart the life of the prophet peace be    
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5500) upon him but also the teaching of the quran and 
so on so but muslims are spared this agony of    
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5507) these convulsions of going over the same thing 
over and over again because they have this this    
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5512) is the sunnah i suppose that they can right 
exactly and that's why the sun is so important    
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5516) you know it's it's really the the the firm 
you know in the quran you know uh that that    
[1:32:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5522) it's the firmest handhold right holding on to the 
religion holding on to the rope of allah you know  
[1:32:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5530) hold on altogether to the rope of god and do 
not separate from it yeah do not separate from    
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5535) each other because that is what brings you 
to safety otherwise you're just going to be    
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5539) adrift literally and drown exactly yeah and i 
think what you said too is very important about    
[1:32:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5545) the integrated nature of we are body we are 
mind and we are soul we are all three together    
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5551) and you know the idea is that that is why in 
islam those three are never separate if you    
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5556) look at the muslim prayer what is it you pray 
we pray with our bodies our bodies are moving    
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5561) we're praying with our tongues and our minds 
because we're saying and reciting certain things    
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5564) and obviously the most important thing where is 
the heart but that's not the only thing it's all    
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5568) three together and from a christian perspective 
it's like well who cares where you're standing why    
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5572) do you have to watch people praying like why would 
you watch before you pray well no because you have    
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5576) to be in a state of physical ritual purity well 
why you know jews on this day they're the bible    
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5583) but the prophets moses and son are all depicted 
as doing wudu before they pray well this was the    
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5588) norm biblical norm but today it is completely 
like many other things in the bible completely    
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5592) forgotten by contemporary submission ultimate you 
know attitude of submission is to take your head    
[1:33:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5597) which is the highest part of you right and your 
it contains your brain and your face is the most    
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5601) noble part and to put it literally at the lowest 
point which is what jesus is doing in the gospels    
[1:33:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5607) jesus is portrayed as doing that right maybe 
the prophet and when you do it you're saying    
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5612) glory be to my lord the highest so he's the 
highest and you're putting your highest part    
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5616) in the lowest and that's the proper relationship 
because he's the master and you're the cre he's    
[1:33:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5620) a creator and you're the creature and that's 
when freedom comes from the islamic freedom your    
[1:33:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5624) freedom from nafs freedom from the dunya which 
enslaves and takes us over whereas the world looks    
[1:33:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5629) to the dunya for freedom right and of 
course it doesn't find it because it's    
[1:33:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5634) more of the same so right and not only is it 
freedom you know the ultimate true freedom but    
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5639) also it is the ultimate realization of the actual 
human teleology because you know in the quran  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5648) i did not create jinn in mankind except to worship 
me so worshiping and submitting to god is actually    
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5653) our own our deepest nature in objective nature 
right implanted in us by our creator and so this    
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5661) notion of the fitra right the fitra which is the 
the the original human disposition the prophet    
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5666) peace upon him said that every child is born 
on the fifth and then after that its children    
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5670) teach it you know different religion judaism 
christianities or astronomism something other    
[1:34:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5674) than like just a pure kind of because these other 
religions they started but then they changed    
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5678) right anyway and so it's important that 
you know you just look at the muslim prayer    
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5682) that's why it's integrated and that's why all 
of life you know you come to sexuality it's it's    
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5687) neither you know it's not god in the modern world 
takes sex to be almost like god but it's also not    
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5693) the devil like i mean it's you know it's given 
its proper place and it's brought under the    
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5697) the realm so that's that's very important and as 
you had said earlier this comes more from probably    
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5702) greek uh you know uh certain tributaries and not 
really it's very it's very clear if you you know a    
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5708) bit about greek philosophy and great greek thought 
that this is very familiar territory it's not a    
[1:35:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5713) it's not that new at all really right okay so very 
quickly now moving along so marx and again mark's    
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5720) a huge figure this is like you know like a half 
a lion right but in general religion is a sign of    
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5726) weakness and freedom you know can only be achieved 
through the abolishment of religion so this is a    
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5732) very familiar to us as modern people again we are 
usually you know unaware of the degree to which    
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5737) our psychology is really influenced by karl marx 
friedrich nietzsche sigmund freud you know these    
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5743) people it's like they live on it's like they 
have left such a sediment in in our minds you    
[1:35:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5749) know if we realize that we can say wait a minute 
but i don't want that i'm not mar i don't have    
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5752) to you know anyway nietzsche 1844 1900 the quote 
unquote death of god basically did also to this    
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5759) notion of the death of human nature if there's no 
god to provide stability to the world in meaning    
[1:36:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5763) then also human nature is kind of untethered 
from its source and so we read in the quran  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5771) do not be like those who forgot god so he forgot 
caused them to forget themselves and this is you    
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5777) see this in modern western history people turn 
their backs on god and then they don't know who    
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5782) they are anymore exactly the only is pretty nature 
actually was very perceptive in many ways he    
[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5787) he uh shared the muslim um critique of many 
aspects of western and christian life you know the    
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5794) kind of the death wish the denial of of of uh the 
sexuality he understood all that extremely well    
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5800) and he had actually many positive things to say 
about islam as well this is the irony and yet he    
[1:36:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5805) he persisted in his um his atheism and and and saw 
refuge in a kind of greek kind of virtue ethics in    
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5812) a way a heroism and but um but no he was not all 
a lot of what he said was actually very insightful    
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5819) although he obviously had a a fundamental problem 
uh at the heart of his worldview though absolutely    
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5824) and again two lines is not at all to give 
nietzsche his due i mean because he's    
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5829) quite profound and prophetic in the sense that he 
really foresaw you know what the west had done and    
[1:37:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5833) that's his whole you know the the marketplace the 
guy going out there right so he was telling people    
[1:37:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5838) you european christians or post-christians in 
the late 19th century you don't understand the    
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5844) implications of the enlightenment quote-unquote 
killing of god right and you're just riding on    
[1:37:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5849) the fumes of christian morality and civility 
but you don't understand the implications of    
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5853) what you've done i do yeah we didn't go back 
and say we should believe in god but he foretold    
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5858) you know that what this would lead to so anyway 
sigmund freud then comes along and he sees sex as    
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5864) absolutely foundational to human person dude and 
happiness freud is extremely important i mean his    
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5868) theories have been debunked for like decades and 
decades but he lives on in so many aspects of our    
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5874) culture and our psyche and so he's really one 
who says again god is gone right and he was an    
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5879) atheist i mean all of these marks nietzsche freud 
these are all hardcore atheists not also but these    
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5884) other they're all atheists right and that's not 
neutral if you ask a muslim is your view of the    
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5889) world and the way you perceive things and you know 
is it influenced by your belief in that well of    
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5893) course yeah i mean it's profoundly influenced so 
how can someone be an atheist and that's not going    
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5897) to profoundly influence the way they look at the 
world we cannot just take these thinkers as like    
[1:38:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5901) neutral right and think that their atheism 
is not very germane to you know the ideas    
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5908) that they come up with in the way they perceive 
the world so we have to be very careful of that    
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5912) anyway so freud makes sex absolutely foundational 
to human personhood and happiness however    
[1:38:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5919) he realizes that it's a very powerful force in 
that civilization the possibility of civilization    
[1:38:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5925) civilization requires it to be contained but so 
he sees this fundamental struggle so he wrote    
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5930) that word civilization and its discontents and 
it's that sexual discontent and he said even    
[1:38:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5935) infants are sexual right so this is again so freud 
is very so we see through so and through the 19th    
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5941) century kind of increasing psychologization of 
the human person and then with freud we get the    
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5946) sexualization of that inner psychology so you are 
like very much your inner psychology right and now    
[1:39:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5953) your sexuality is at the core of that inner 
psychology and then in america you get people    
[1:39:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5957) like kinsey the the famous in the 50s and 60s 
who continued freud's work and also uh did    
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5963) actual empirical research on the sexual life of 
babies which i won't go into but yeah right he    
[1:39:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5969) carried that continued precisely this trajectory 
um and had a huge influence obviously on the the    
[1:39:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5975) sexual revolution 1960s absolutely and so i didn't 
put them on here but definitely alfred kinsey um    
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5982) is very um very uh central to this nietzsche 
freud and oscar wilde you know they concur    
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5988) basically that moral notions are essentially 
a matter of taste this is very important um    
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5992) it's also referred to as emotivism and this 
is discussed at length by aleister mcintyre    
[1:39:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=5997) british guy uh british philosopher who's living in 
north america um but his book after after virtue    
[1:40:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6003) which i've read is absolutely extraordinary uh 
if you want to understand a very profound in many    
[1:40:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6008) ways a very positive understanding of moral theory 
on a fairly advanced level he's a he used to be a    
[1:40:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6014) marxist actually he became a catholic through his 
study of tomism uh that's the philosophy of thomas    
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6019) aquinas and and heads the word virtue which is 
uh but um he's a brilliant brilliant philosopher    
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6025) aleister mcinerney still still very much with us 
i think absolutely yeah so so but this notion that    
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6030) you know as actually what freud making 
sexuality the center of the personhood  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6039) have you seen him who takes his desire as his 
god and this is literally i mean subhanallah you    
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6044) see you know like nietzsche okay we forget god 
so we don't know who we are anymore freud you    
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6050) know we don't have god so we take our literally 
our desires as our god and like this literally    
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6055) what they're doing like like this is like uh 
confirmation of what the quran is saying well the    
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6059) christians i don't know how they think to say but 
the quran is incredibly profound and insightful    
[1:41:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6063) to all these things yeah exactly right and so this 
idea also that it's a matter of taste or emotivism    
[1:41:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6069) right is is similar that it's just a question of 
you know and we'll get to this too because we read    
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6074) verses and this is very important for muslims 
too right you can't just look out and say    
[1:41:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6077) oh this appears to be good or society says 
it's good because in the quran right it says  
[1:41:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6090) um you know what about one whose evil 
deeds or or foul deeds have been made    
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6096) to look beautiful to him they've been beautified 
for him so that he sees them as good so you can    
[1:41:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6101) see something as good and beautiful but that's 
not because it is good and beautiful it's because    
[1:41:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6106) it's been made to seem that way and who's doing 
this tazine who's doing this adornment of it    
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6111) it's satan and that says in the quran too right    
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6114) that uh um this hopo bird when it comes from bill 
peace the queen of sheba back to solomon it says  
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6127) that i found them you know her the peace the queen 
of sheba and and her people bowing to the sun    
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6135) you know worshipping the sun rather than god was  
[1:42:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6141) and and satan has beautified their act for them 
in other words he made it look fair and it's a    
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6146) foul deed right there they're they're worshiping 
other than the actual creator they're worshiping    
[1:42:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6151) his creation rather than him and 
satan made it appear fair to them    
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6156) so so so this emotivism that's 
exactly what emotivism means what oh  
[1:42:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6165) i see this as being good or hassan or beautiful    
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6168) this looks good to me right it appears good to 
my sensibilities and this is how most modern    
[1:42:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6173) people many modern people this is how they 
decide morality well this appears good to my    
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6177) my sentiments well okay how do you know it really 
is or not how do you know that you're that you're    
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6182) that foul things have not just simply been made 
to appear fair to you by satan and his you know    
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6189) those who are sort of working with him these 
are realities i mean we're not materialists    
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6194) we believe in these unseen realities right there's 
absolutely every time the quartet says the scene    
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6200) in the unseen realm always the unseen realm comes 
first right it's principial we see what happens in    
[1:43:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6204) the uh world is really the manifestation of unseen 
principles the whole world is the manifestation of    
[1:43:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6211) of of of an unseen creator we don't see him in 
this world right and things that happen i mean    
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6217) even you don't even have to be a believer to you 
know uh to appreciate this point what we do our    
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6222) actions are expressions of our inner reality right 
of who we are kind of in an immaterial sense yes    
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6230) we don't see our consciousness our consciousness 
is is invisible absolutely but it's manifested and    
[1:43:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6234) science we can't see our thoughts no scientists 
ever say no experiment can ever see our thoughts    
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6239) so this is this is kind of an example of the 
the unseen affecting the the material world    
[1:44:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6245) right and then you have uh wilhelm reich and 
herbert mark hughes both of these um uh german    
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6251) i mean very important very important figures 
also who was 1930s mostly 30s and 40 mark hughes    
[1:44:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6256) a little bit later really pushed very openly for 
sexual liberation even back you know starting from    
[1:44:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6262) the 30s with reich these are very dubious things 
it's called in the 30s which the nazis closed down    
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6267) but they continued after that and exactly yes and 
and you really see that there's this radical push    
[1:44:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6272) and again we said that sexuality and sexual norms 
are very tied to the family and they were not    
[1:44:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6277) unaware of that they weren't it was not just 
like oh we want to have fun we don't they    
[1:44:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6280) didn't see the the implications these people 
were very much against the family they wanted    
[1:44:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6285) to destroy them their names have been associated 
with what some people call cultural marxism uh    
[1:44:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6290) is so yeah a particular way of describing this 
kind of movement that in today's world i mean yeah    
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6295) and then you have a number of other like feminist 
thinkers i don't actually put them on here but    
[1:44:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6299) you have simone de beauvoir obviously in france in 
1950s she comes out with a book with the feminist    
[1:45:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6305) mystique you have you know um jermaine greer uh 
in the 60s and 70s you have uh shlomite fire uh    
[1:45:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6312) firestone um you know there's a whole range and by 
the way you know i mean people don't realize like    
[1:45:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6317) you look into these people i mean really like 
all of these people all these people mentioned    
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6323) just read like their wikipedia page you'll be 
very aghast that like about the kind of people    
[1:45:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6329) they were how they live their lives and so on 
and so forth i mean simon de beauvoir who sort    
[1:45:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6333) of put forth as this big feminist icon she and 
michel foucault who's also practically a prophet    
[1:45:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6339) to a lot of these kind of modern post-colonial 
academics and woke you know kind of people right    
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6345) they both they campaigned in france to get rid of 
uh you know to lower the age of sexual consent to    
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6351) include children both of them did i mean they 
they campaigned for pedophilia and foucault    
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6356) left a very dissolute life morally speaking and he 
actually died after catching aids at a bdsm themed    
[1:46:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6362) bath house in san francisco i mean so i 
again like i mean it's not like as muslims    
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6367) okay it doesn't mean he cannot have like insights 
and critiques or maybe simon de beauvoir i mean    
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6372) okay fine but the point is like we cannot be blind 
to the fact that you know these people's atheism    
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6378) and de beauvoir also was a radical atheist and 
she was grow up in a very conservative christian    
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6382) family and she became an atheist i think when 
she was 17 or 18. jermaine greer also atheist you    
[1:46:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6387) know by the time she was like 18 she talks about 
this right she had a very unfortunate experience    
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6392) and also just went to school with the nuns and um 
australia and they could not answer her questions    
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6398) and she you know was kind of rebellious and 
just said i'm not having it but anyway um all    
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6404) right let's let's move on so yes let's move on all 
right so homosexuality in the wake of the sexual    
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6409) revolution i mean very very fast i'm not going to 
talk about there's a book that came out in 1989    
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6414) it's called after the ball how america will 
conquer its fear and hatred of gays in the 90s    
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6419) it was written by two gay men marshall kirk who 
was a neuropsychologist and hunter madsen was a    
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6426) social marketing and advertising executive 
so look at the you know um two fields here    
[1:47:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6432) a neuropsychologist and a marketing and uh 
advertising executive and they're both harvard    
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6438) trained and they basically put together a plan 
i'm not saying their one book is the whole reason    
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6443) why things are the way they are but in the eight 
in 1989 they came out with basically a manifesto    
[1:47:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6449) how are we going to get america and by extension 
the rest of the at least the western world because    
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6454) america is of course the peak of its power at that 
time right to basically overcome its rejection    
[1:47:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6460) of homosexuality and so on and so forth it's a 
very fascinating read it's also a maddening read    
[1:47:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6465) i think if you're a religious believer because 
you see that they basically put a plan which was    
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6470) implemented like lock step and barrel like i 
mean everything they said like came to be done    
[1:47:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6476) um and they actually said i mean this is quoting 
from the book this is their own words they say    
[1:48:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6480) the campaign we outline in this book though 
complex depends centrally upon a program of    
[1:48:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6486) unabashed propaganda these are their words 
firmly grounded in long-established principles of    
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6491) psychology and advertising and these are harvard 
educated psychologists and advertising executives    
[1:48:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6496) and you know one thing they say you know one 
major aspect of this pillar is desensitization    
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6502) the principle of desensitization builds on 
people's primal instincts whereby a flood of    
[1:48:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6507) gay related advertising presented in 
the least offensive fashion possible    
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6511) gets the job done and then they say if straights 
can't shut off the shower they may at least    
[1:48:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6515) eventually get used to being wet right so 
this was all like this all very intentional    
[1:48:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6520) and then they also say they talk about conversion 
and they say we mean conversion now look at that    
[1:48:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6525) i mean again straight quote from the book we mean 
conversion of the average americans emotions mind    
[1:48:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6532) and will through a planned psychological attack in 
the form of propaganda fed to the nation via the    
[1:48:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6539) media wow there's amazing quotes actually i mean 
it could come it could have been come straight    
[1:49:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6544) from hell i mean there's a deliberate attempt to 
subvert undermine uh traditional deliberate yeah    
[1:49:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6552) quite quite intentional you keep you 
stressed several times they were harvard    
[1:49:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6555) educated so you know they had the intelligence uh 
uh to to uh promote promote this and and you say    
[1:49:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6561) they were very successful right and i just want to 
you know i want people to also just realize that    
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6567) you know again we should not just naively take 
the situation that exists around us it's just oh    
[1:49:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6572) well that's what it is right like many muslims who 
kind of just parrot what they hear especially in    
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6577) western societies and parrot the discourse and all 
it's like do you realize that your discourse and    
[1:49:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6582) your entire moral moral sensibility has literally 
been crafted by people with a very particular you    
[1:49:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6589) know um intention to craft it in a very particular 
way right i'm not saying the whole thing is just    
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6595) these two men right but but like what they said 
and if you read the book i mean they say you know    
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6600) again they themselves say there are all of these 
kind of dysfunctional dysfunctionalities about    
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6605) the gay community and they critique it themselves 
they have like 10 points about all of these things    
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6609) and they say we're not going to show that to the 
public they say when you bring like you're sitting    
[1:50:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6614) in a tent and you bring the horses you know you 
let the front and you don't let the stinky back    
[1:50:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6618) and you leave this thing one thing is obvious 
there's something that shake hands are used    
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6621) as mentioned is the anal intercourse uh which is 
the staple diet of um this is extremely dangerous    
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6627) practice and it's an excellent way to transmit 
disease as well um yeah and and so you know this    
[1:50:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6635) this current emphasis on on public health and 
so on you know uh advertising against smoking    
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6641) and so on is all very good of course but this 
one practice uh gets away scot-free even though    
[1:50:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6646) uh it's an excellent way to to uh spread disease 
obviously uh aids uh the virus and other means so    
[1:50:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6653) it's it's uh but that but that's not highlighted 
or mentioned that's overlooked completely right    
[1:51:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6661) okay so finishing off so there's another book 
which again i'm just putting on here a queer    
[1:51:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6667) thing happens to america and what a long strange 
trip it's been by michael brown 2011 that's a big    
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6672) fix 600 tome and also kind of chronicles the 
last couple decades and also full of quotes    
[1:51:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6678) from you know sort of gay activists lgbt you know 
organizations and stuff and a lot of it is very    
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6684) very shocking and it's not stuff you kind of read 
in the public but it's things that have been said    
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6688) and written publicly but are not really you know 
shouted from the rooftop so to speak and so you    
[1:51:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6693) have to dig a little bit but when you see some of 
the the things that are admitted by people when    
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6698) they're kind of speaking kind of off the record 
or even by matson and kirk on the record like    
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6702) they wrote this book you know it really kind of 
makes you do a double take and so it's it's worth    
[1:51:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6707) you know doing that and all and one of the 
resources that we're going to talk about at the    
[1:51:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6710) end you know you can actually get a very good um 
summary in two podcast episodes on these two books    
[1:51:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6717) so you have to actually read good thousand pages 
play i'm not familiar with the issue works yeah    
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6722) yeah okay all right um so very quickly so um from 
truman's i have a couple quotes from truman's book    
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6730) says it is difficult to overestimate the 
importance of this move to make sexual    
[1:52:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6734) desire central to human identity in modern 
society everything from the common use of terms    
[1:52:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6739) such as straight and gay and everyday conversation 
to the underlying assumptions of international    
[1:52:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6744) human rights law presupposes that this 
is the case that what is the case that    
[1:52:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6749) sexual desire is central to human identity 
right that basically our desire is our god  
[1:52:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6757) and and the idea that human flourishing is 
virtually synonymous with sexual fulfillment    
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6762) is a commonplace in fact virtually an 
intuition of modern western culture so    
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6768) you come and say well you know our religion 
prohibits particular kind of sexual behavior    
[1:52:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6772) but wait a minute you are prohibiting people 
from sexual flourishing which means you are    
[1:52:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6777) undermining what it means to actually 
be a human being like that's where this    
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6780) symptom is this is the book actually yeah just uh 
from yeah and um uh i i have my own copy obviously    
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6787) there is a um i'm proud to say he's actually a 
british uh living in the united states where he is    
[1:53:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6794) a professor of biblical religious studies at grove 
city college but this is definitely worth reading    
[1:53:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6799) and if you read if you get the audio 
version which is what i listen to both books    
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6804) he reads it out himself so you can listen 
to him read it out in his british accent  
[1:53:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6809) yup all right and then the next one moving right 
along if we if we are at root defined in large    
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6814) part by our sexual desires if sexual desire or 
orientation as we now say is who we are right not    
[1:53:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6820) just what we do who are then sex must be political 
because rules governing sexual behavior are rules    
[1:53:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6826) that govern what is and is not considered by 
society to be legitimate as an identity so again    
[1:53:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6832) this identity question is absolutely central 
and we have to understand the importance of it    
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6837) and also why as muslims it is such a problematic 
category and then finally the old chestnut of love    
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6843) the sinner hate the sin simply does not work in a 
world where the sin is the identity of the sinner    
[1:54:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6848) and the two cannot be cannot be separated even at 
a conceptual level okay very very important here    
[1:54:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6855) i'm going to now go faster i mean we spent a long 
time setting the groundwork but i think it's been    
[1:54:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6860) important to do this because again if if people 
have you know absorbed what we've been talking    
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6866) about now we're going to get into islam and what 
does islam say we've already adam brady look at    
[1:54:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6871) the islamic paradigm on sex and sexuality and now 
we have a context in which we can fit that in and    
[1:54:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6876) so we can go through this much faster because 
of course this will be familiar to muslims but    
[1:54:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6880) hopefully when people hear this now and see these 
verses you'll also see it in a different context    
[1:54:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6885) right because you've seen and again this is going 
to be uploaded people can take a break stop go    
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6891) have coffee you know come back and finish this 
english but yeah so yeah you don't have to listen    
[1:54:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6896) to all of this in one go right so yeah okay all 
right creation of the male and the female so we're    
[1:55:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6900) just going to go from the quran but again reading 
it in terms of what we've been talking about    
[1:55:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6906) and by his creation of the male and the female 
so so god created a male and he created a    
[1:55:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6910) female right it's part of his 
purposeful design in creation  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6917) and that he created the two mates the male and    
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6920) the female so they're mates of each 
other they're meant to go together  
[1:55:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6925) and then he says and the male is not like 
the female so men and women are the same in    
[1:55:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6929) many respects they're both equally human they 
both equally have you know the duty to worship    
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6935) god and the ability to uh develop themselves 
morally and spiritually and to you know um uh uh    
[1:55:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6942) earn the pleasure of god and to earn 
paradise and so forth right but they are not    
[1:55:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6946) there are many respects in which men and women are 
different physically emotionally psychologically    
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6949) and so on and so forth statistically of 
course you know i mean individuals are    
[1:55:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6953) are very different i mean men and 
women but statistically speaking    
[1:55:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6956) there are things that are dominant in males 
things are dominant females this is known it's    
[1:56:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6961) very not politically correct to sort of speak 
in these terms today but the science is there    
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6965) a lot of research you know yeah of course it's 
there but you're just not a lot of youtube videos    
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6969) you just have to pretend it doesn't exist 
right because it's not politically correct so    
[1:56:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6973) but but we know foreign so we're fine with that 
we know it's true both by by revelation and by    
[1:56:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6981) just you know observation and our experience of 
the world and then this longer verse i'll just    
[1:56:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6985) read in english for the sake of time and of his 
signs is that he created for you from yourselves    
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6990) mates that you may find tranquility in them 
and he placed between you affection and mercy    
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=6995) indeed and that are signs for people who reflect 
and then o mankind fear your lord we hear this in    
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7002) the khutbah every friday o mankind fear 
your lord who created you from one soul    
[1:56:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7006) and created from it it's mate and dispersed 
from both of them many men and women right  
[1:56:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7014) next  
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7019) i just say that because every muslim people they 
don't know arabic they'll recognize that phrase    
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7023) because you know always the hookah starts with 
it on friday other verses we have the beautiful    
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7027) verse in the quran right about here the parity 
the spiritual parity between men and women surely    
[1:57:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7033) men who say that to allah and women who submit to 
allah men who have faith in women who have faith    
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7039) men who are obedient in women who are obedient 
men who are truthful and women who are truthful    
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7044) men who are steadfast in women who are steadfast 
men who humble themselves to god and women who    
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7049) humble themselves to god or allah men who give 
alms in women who give arms men who fast and women    
[1:57:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7055) who fast men who guard their chastity and women 
who guard their chastity men who remember allah    
[1:57:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7060) much and women who remember allah much right ten 
different qualities men who do it women who do it    
[1:57:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7066) for them has allah prepared forgiveness and a 
mighty reward beautiful and then we have the    
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7071) believing men and believing women are allies 
of one another they enjoin what is right and    
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7076) forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and 
give zakat and obey allah and his messenger    
[1:58:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7082) those allah will have mercy upon them indeed allah 
is exalted in might and wise right so men and    
[1:58:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7087) women they are meant to be allies of one another 
that they are constantly enjoining each other    
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7093) but to what to just following their whims no 
they are joining each other to what is right    
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7098) and forbidding what is wrong right in coming 
together and forming communities that exalt    
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7103) the divine standards of right and wrong and try 
to you know uh give people a greater ability to    
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7109) realize that moral goal in their lives that moral 
standard and to develop themselves by doing so    
[1:58:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7116) and the established parent gives a cat right 
and then another verse and this is more than    
[1:58:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7121) one verse like this in the quran whoever works 
righteousness man or woman right or male or female    
[1:58:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7127) and has faith verily to him will we give a 
new life a life that is good and pure and    
[1:58:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7132) will bestow on such their reward according 
to the best of their actions right so we    
[1:58:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7136) have this beautiful parity complementarity 
between men and women and this parity also    
[1:59:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7141) right on this level however less of the male is 
not like the female and so we do see that in the    
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7146) practical life of how men and women interact in 
society the roles that each one predominantly    
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7152) is meant to play right in the way they're meant 
to complement each other they are not treated    
[1:59:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7156) the same because they are not created the same and 
so men are the protectors and maintainers of women    
[1:59:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7162) this is how yusefarily translated 
protectors and maintainers anyway    
[1:59:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7165) there's a big discussion on exactly what this 
means and of course it's very controversial  
[1:59:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7176) again but men have a particular role to play 
vis-a-vis women because god has given them one    
[1:59:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7181) more than the other he says strength but again 
there's a lot of discussion as to what the more    
[1:59:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7185) is and because they support them from their 
means and then in another verse sort of women    
[1:59:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7190) have rights similar to the rights against them 
according to what is equitable but men have a    
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7194) degree over them degree of advantage again this 
is a loss here and god is exalted in power and    
[1:59:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7199) wise again there can be a whole discussion on 
you know the exact uh rights and duties of men    
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7203) and women men and women have the same rights and 
duties in certain respects they also have you know    
[2:00:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7207) men have some rights that women don't have women 
have some rights that men don't have women have a    
[2:00:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7210) right to be supportive financially their entire 
lives men don't have that right they have to    
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7214) support themselves you know men take on 
certain leadership roles that women don't    
[2:00:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7218) take like head of the household you know 
kind of paradigmatically speaking also    
[2:00:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7224) religious leadership like leading prayer and so 
forth right so there are distinctions there so    
[2:00:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7228) there are areas of overlap in areas of distinction 
this is fine because of and it all balances out in    
[2:00:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7235) equity according to the wisdom of the creator from 
an islamic perspective and so the difference in    
[2:00:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7240) complementary nature of the male and the female 
as we read men and women are not the same right    
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7246) there are obvious biological there's an 
obvious biological complementarity between    
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7250) male and female bodies and reproductive systems 
as we've been talking about um there is purpose    
[2:00:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7256) again this goes back to what you've said now 
it all falls into place purpose is inherent to    
[2:01:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7260) the body and its functions as created by god 
it's not for us to decide or sign on our own    
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7265) people say well who cares what you do if you're 
quote unquote you know dangly bits and all no    
[2:01:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7270) i mean those things have a purpose you either 
use them for that purpose or you don't use them    
[2:01:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7275) right but but they are to be directed the way they 
were meant to be directed by god again with the    
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7280) more latitude that the islamic tradition provides 
in terms of you know um rapport between husband    
[2:01:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7285) and wife also you know pleasure is you know not 
every act like in the catholic church at least    
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7290) every single sexual act has to be at least uh um 
potentially open to uh to uh conception that's    
[2:01:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7297) not true in islam i mean a man and woman they 
can enjoy themselves also just for pleasure    
[2:01:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7301) when the woman is menstruating they're not allowed 
to have intercourse but they're allowed to have    
[2:01:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7305) other types of you know pleasurable activity right 
so there is sort of this you know notion that but    
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7310) again this is this is these are the limits that 
god has placed right he's allowed this within this    
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7315) parameter uh it's not stricter than that but it's 
also not you know uh wider than that or the other    
[2:02:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7320) way it's not wider it's also much stricter so 
this idea that my body my choice this is this has    
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7325) nothing to do with an islamic perspective god's 
god's body in the end of the day they're on loan    
[2:02:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7330) to us we he created them um and and you can choose 
whether to obey him or not to your own advantage    
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7337) or disadvantage respectively but it's not up 
to us to make up the rules or to impose our own    
[2:02:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7344) meaning onto things because we do believe that 
they do have the meaning that's been imparted    
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7348) up to them by their creator because we're not 
atheists and we're not materialists and we're    
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7353) not deists either and so we believe that you know 
all of creation has a purpose our bodies have    
[2:02:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7358) a purpose our souls have a purpose our creation 
isn't as human beings has a purpose our creations    
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7362) men and women separate also has a purpose right 
and so this is very central complementarity and    
[2:02:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7367) disposition of masculine versus feminine traits 
fathers and mothers are not interchangeable    
[2:02:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7373) there are religious rules for men and others 
for women we talked about this even in prayer    
[2:02:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7377) even where you wouldn't think it would be relevant 
like you know men are supposed to stand more like    
[2:03:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7382) apart when they're praying women more contracted 
why well because men lisa right women are more    
[2:03:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7388) contracted men more expensive that's just 
how they stand in the prayer and how they    
[2:03:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7392) make the suju you know the prostration so 
even in very minute the sharia is thoroughly    
[2:03:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7397) gendered from start to finish which is why 
i said earlier the contemporary scene race    
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7402) gender and sexual orientation is all one we say 
no race islam makes no distinction between race    
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7408) and it says in the quran that you know among 
his signs are the creation of or you know um    
[2:03:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7412) uh that the difference in your tongues and your 
colors are a sign of god right so absolutely no    
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7420) race distinction whatsoever right uh in the 
prophet very explicit peace be upon him that    
[2:03:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7425) arab is not superior to a non-arab nor 
non-arab-tuned arab right and a white man    
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7429) is not superior to black men or black men to white 
men except by way of piety in fear of god right so    
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7436) complete like you know i'm not saying there's no 
racism among muslims but in islam right this is    
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7440) something that you know is is is uh you know 
races are all considered equal right gender    
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7448) equally valid and equally valuable men are not 
better than women women are not better than men    
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7453) but they are different and so the sharia treats 
them differently and the gender distinctions are    
[2:04:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7457) pervasive so it's a it's a thoroughly gendered 
tradition so this idea of moving towards this    
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7462) androgynous norm where men and women are just 
all the same and there's no boundaries this is    
[2:04:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7467) completely against you know just the heart of 
islam you have to throw the entire religion out    
[2:04:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7472) the window to incorporate this type of thing right 
so we can't get on board with this kind of radical    
[2:04:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7479) gender egalitarianism which sees mathematical 
sameness and equality and we will not rest    
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7484) until fifty percent of all ceos and all companies 
are women and fifty percent of all nurses in all    
[2:04:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7489) hospitals that's never going to happen by the way 
except through very coercious social engineering    
[2:04:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7495) yeah and jordan peterson uh who speaks on this 
subject frequently he has an excellent obviously    
[2:05:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7500) a scientist a clinical psychologist um and has a 
range of data all the data speaks uh against this    
[2:05:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7507) uh position that you're you're criticizing as well 
yeah um yeah and there you go okay showing all    
[2:05:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7515) sorts of psychological physiological psychological 
dispositional differences between men and women    
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7520) though this is taboo to say today because 
it goes against you know the zeitgeist and    
[2:05:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7524) notions of social constructionism and 
you know certain uh you know uh gender    
[2:05:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7529) ideologies and so forth so anyway the nature 
of morality and ethics in a sense this is very    
[2:05:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7534) important we've touched on it so again hopefully 
we can go through it um uh uh um quickly but this    
[2:05:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7540) is really important for the the latter part of the 
discussion which we are finally getting to sexual    
[2:05:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7545) norms and then homosexuality specifically and 
then we'll be wrapping up hopefully challah um so    
[2:05:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7551) so where does morality come from right 
where does it come from in the west you've    
[2:05:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7555) had deontological ethics back when religion 
was more um uh prominent this notion that    
[2:06:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7561) you know moral behavior was a largely a uh 
question of doing your moral duty and the    
[2:06:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7566) moral duty was often you know seen as coming from 
god and divine commands right and this is kind of    
[2:06:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7570) natural within a atheistic universe um and so this 
is also for muslims it's very fundamental god's    
[2:06:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7577) command is absolutely fundamental and we mentioned 
this before and i also mentioned the voice verse  
[2:06:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7585) i have created jinn in mankind but to 
worship me right and then um it is god    
[2:06:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7590) in his messenger allah's messenger alone right 
for the muslim who are legislators of what is    
[2:06:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7595) right and wrong permitted and prohibited 
this is not our prerogative as human beings    
[2:06:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7599) either collectively to say we just sort of 
extemporaneously like you know expose it like a    
[2:06:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7605) rational morality or let alone you know 
even more so our individual this is the    
[2:06:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7610) motto well what do you think of this what 
do you where do you stand on premarital sex    
[2:06:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7614) it's not your it's nothing to do with 
what you say your opinion doesn't  
[2:07:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7626) don't ask me i was the one who 
made us because when you do it    
[2:07:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7630) you know you get people like legalizing child 
pornography in the 1970s that's what happens    
[2:07:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7636) when you just leave people and so this is a 
very critical verse right uh i'll just read    
[2:07:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7641) in english again for the sake of time it is not 
for any believing man or woman when allah and his    
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7646) messenger have decided on an affair to have any 
choice in their matter okay in the word you know  
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7658) and this is the the fetish of the modern 
world choice well i chose did you choose    
[2:07:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7662) why do you wear hijab well i chose to you know 
everything comes down to choice it's legitimate    
[2:07:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7666) if you chose it it's not legit if you didn't 
choose this strikes at the heart of that right    
[2:07:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7670) not believing for any believing men or woman not 
appropriate right or becoming for any believing    
[2:07:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7675) men or women when god and this messenger have 
decided on an affair to have any choice in their    
[2:08:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7680) matter and whoever disobeys god and his messenger 
or allah his messenger has manifestly gone astray    
[2:08:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7687) this verse just completely you know shatters that 
myth right that if god and this messenger have    
[2:08:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7693) decided on an affair that's it it's it's their 
prerogative god's and obviously the messenger only    
[2:08:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7699) commanding is obeying the command of his lord 
so it's really god in the end right now you can    
[2:08:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7704) disobey go ahead but you're disobeying you can't 
make up your own morality you can either obey    
[2:08:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7710) god's morality or disobey it and you know reap the 
consequences of either choice but it's not your    
[2:08:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7716) prerogative to make it up so that's one dividing 
command absolutely fundamental for us as muslims    
[2:08:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7721) that cannot be lost from any discussion that 
we have as muslims particularly internally when    
[2:08:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7726) it comes to questions of sex sexual morality or 
anything number two consequences matter so there    
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7732) is a type of consequentialism which becomes the 
dominant ethical theory in the modern world in the    
[2:08:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7737) 19th and 20th centuries through people like john 
you know first jeremy bentham and jon stewart mill    
[2:09:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7741) right moral action is that which brings the 
greatest benefit for the greatest number the    
[2:09:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7745) greatest happiness for the greatest number 
so utilitarianism right so we have kind of    
[2:09:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7750) a in a sense i wouldn't like to say it 
this way but there's sort of a divine    
[2:09:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7753) utilitarianism in the sense that god is wise just 
and merciful and he legislates for us what is best    
[2:09:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7758) for us both in this world and that both in this 
world and the next from his omniscient perspective  
[2:09:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7765) god knows and you don't know so consequences 
matter but it's not just the consequences    
[2:09:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7770) that we in our limited perspective fixate upon 
it's it's you know in a larger and we'll see in    
[2:09:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7777) another slide or two that there are uh positive 
of the sharia there are there are uh goals that    
[2:09:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7784) the sharia is trying to uphold for the benefit 
in this world and the next of human beings right    
[2:09:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7790) so that's a type of consequentialism but it's 
the one that is a divine consequential that    
[2:09:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7795) god has set and that he has legislated also the 
means of of achieving it and then the third thing    
[2:10:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7801) and this is the third mainstream also in western 
you know historically is uh virtue ethics which    
[2:10:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7807) goes all the way back to aristotle right in 
which muslims also took on aristotle's writings    
[2:10:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7812) on ethics very enthusiastically and modified it 
and improved it and sort of infused it with you    
[2:10:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7817) know the telos of revelation and the spirit of 
you know and improved upon it but they found what    
[2:10:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7822) he said about ethics quite compatible and the idea 
is that virtue and moral character are also a part    
[2:10:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7827) of paramount importance right the notion of or the 
prophet or or gods we read in the quran allah says  
[2:10:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7837) speaking to the prophet you are up you know you 
have a noble or a magnificent moral character    
[2:10:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7844) right and and even the word virtue is like you 
know uh mcintyre has like after virtue that's why    
[2:10:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7851) he called it that there's no virtue that we don't 
talk about the word is so old-fashioned and virtue    
[2:10:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7855) like gets a chuckle like virtue like what is 
that right but the prophet said peace be upon him  
[2:11:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7864) i was sent but to perfect the 
noble traits of character so    
[2:11:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7867) your character matters there are things 
like for example hasset which is envy    
[2:11:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7872) the prophet peace be upon him said that envy eats 
up good deeds like fire eats wood and envy means    
[2:11:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7877) that you are so jealous of what someone has that 
you don't have to the extent that you want that    
[2:11:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7882) person to lose that benefit if you cannot enjoy 
it yourself so it's one thing to say oh look at    
[2:11:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7886) the benefit that person has i wish i had that 
uh but it's another thing to say i actually    
[2:11:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7891) you know uh willfully uh desire that he 
should lose that benefit because i can't    
[2:11:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7896) stand to see someone uh you know uh enjoy 
it if i can't enjoy it this is very ugly    
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7901) and and this is not even acting on it's not like 
i'm going and sabotaging like you know keying his    
[2:11:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7906) brand new mercedes like you know i'm not doing it 
but just in my heart i have that hassai in in that    
[2:11:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7912) state of the heart the prophet said that state 
eats up your good deeds so your your your noble    
[2:11:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7917) your your character matters right and your virtue 
matter matters and then the prophet also said very    
[2:12:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7923) important for us as muslims peace be upon him 
every religion has a characteristic moral traits  
[2:12:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7931) and the characteristic trait of islam is 
modesty right and then finally to round    
[2:12:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7936) this off he said if you have no shame 
or modesty then do as you please either  
[2:12:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7944) okay how does this compare with the contemporary 
moral and ethical discourse where does divine    
[2:12:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7948) command fit in the moral in the current moral 
discourse in the modern secular west well it's    
[2:12:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7954) irrelevant right there's no god is dead nietra 
told us right and the west has been secularizing    
[2:12:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7958) for centuries so sexual morality is separated 
from religion we saw the beginning becomes    
[2:12:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7963) thoroughly personally subjective that's true of 
all morality it becomes a question of emotivism    
[2:12:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7968) and you know personal taste and and and so forth 
right you have center the centrality of these sort    
[2:12:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7973) of notions like replacement notions of replacing 
religion so freedom we talked about right this    
[2:12:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7978) kind of fetishization of personal autonomy whereas 
islam is based on servitude and submission to god    
[2:13:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7984) this notion of autonomy right if you know 
what it means auto itself no most is a law    
[2:13:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7989) autonomy literally means and this was kant who 
really talked a lot about autonomy it means to    
[2:13:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7993) give oneself the law any muslim can immediately 
feel once you translate how blasphemous that is    
[2:13:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=7999) because god is the law giver right he's the the 
law giver and the sharia is his way his law right    
[2:13:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8005) we are not we don't give ourselves the law this 
is to make gods of ourselves literally right so    
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8010) god and this messenger alone have the right to 
legislate as we saw in that verse right that when    
[2:13:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8014) god and this messenger decided upon a matter it 
is not for a believing man or a woman to have a    
[2:13:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8019) say in it and then this notion of authenticity we 
talked about we would say as muslims in response    
[2:13:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8024) to that yes we want to be authentic but we are 
only our true authentic selves as human beings    
[2:13:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8028) when we have found and submitted to our creator 
because that is the objective inherent purpose    
[2:13:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8034) with which he has created all human beings as the 
prophet peace be upon him said every human being    
[2:13:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8038) was born on the fitrah right and so coming back 
to your internal nature and submitting to your    
[2:14:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8044) creator that is the homecoming of every single 
human being if they don't realize it they don't    
[2:14:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8049) realize it so their own detriment but that is 
everyone's true homecoming is back to to god    
[2:14:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8054) and so consequences so divine command we says 
irrelevant in the modern you know ethical moral    
[2:14:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8059) discourse what about consequences well again 
consequentialism utilitarianism is the dominant    
[2:14:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8065) ethical theory right but the consequences are 
judged in purely subjective terms if at all    
[2:14:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8070) and also in purely um material and in this 
worldly terms it's a secular notion of what    
[2:14:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8076) consequences which consequences really matter and 
we would say that allah knows our interests better    
[2:14:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8081) than we do and he alone has full knowledge of all 
consequences and those consequences are related    
[2:14:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8085) both to this world and to the next world as well 
and then finally virtue and moral character we    
[2:14:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8090) talked about virtue is an old-fashioned and 
quaint term in modern parlance sexual behavior    
[2:14:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8095) is seen as irrelevant to moral character right 
you can do whatever you want sexually as long as    
[2:15:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8100) it was consensual no one sees that as having 
any impact on your moral character it's just    
[2:15:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8104) considered totally irrelevant because sex doesn't 
have any meaning anymore it doesn't have any moral    
[2:15:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8109) uh meaning either there's no moral kind of code 
or norm attached to it as we said right um and so    
[2:15:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8116) this also downplaying of more of a virtue of moral 
character right um this again the quran refuses  
[2:15:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8130) the day of judgment is that that day on which 
neither uh wealth nor progeny will avail a    
[2:15:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8135) person right except for one who comes with a sound 
heart the only thing that will value on that day    
[2:15:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8139) is coming to god with a sound heart right 
okay um all right so islamic sexual and gender    
[2:15:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8147) norms again we'll try to just speed through this 
again hopefully this will be familiar to muslims    
[2:15:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8152) but who knows in the modern age and contemporary 
society a lot of muslims surprisingly don't even    
[2:15:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8157) know some of the basic islamic rulings on certain 
of these issues so hopefully this will be a    
[2:16:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8163) beneficial you know experience for our uh 
viewers right so we talked already about the    
[2:16:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8168) centrality of sexual norms to any society 
and moral system so i won't repeat that    
[2:16:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8172) um sexual norms in the shady are tied to family 
into family law right because again sex is    
[2:16:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8178) reproductive and the family's absolute central 
most central most important social institution    
[2:16:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8183) and so you know legislation surrounding sexuality 
is absolutely uh paramount and it is part and    
[2:16:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8190) parcel of our religion it's not negotiable it's 
not something we say oh well we believe in one    
[2:16:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8194) god but we can just change all the sexual norms 
no this lies at the very heart of the religion and    
[2:16:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8199) that's because of the centrality of the family and 
therefore of sex and sexual morality to the faith    
[2:16:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8204) right so as every muslim hopefully should know 
sex outside of marriage which is called zinna    
[2:16:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8209) is strictly forbidden haram and it constitutes a 
major sin kibira right there are major sins and    
[2:16:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8215) you know not less major ascent uh and zuna which 
is sexual intercourse between a man and a woman    
[2:17:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8222) who are not bound by a you know uh islamically 
valid contract um of marriage uh is a major sin    
[2:17:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8230) right why it undermines one of the fundamental 
objectives or positive of the sharia which are    
[2:17:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8235) five or six actually the protection of religion 
the protection of life the protection of lineage    
[2:17:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8241) and family which is where the prohibition of 
you know uh extranetal sex comes in uh the probe    
[2:17:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8248) protection of property protection of intellect 
and the protection of honor these are the six    
[2:17:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8253) you know overriding objectives that the scholars 
looked at the rulings of the sharia on the divine    
[2:17:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8257) legislation and said these are the six 
fundamental categories that are necessary    
[2:17:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8262) for human beings to flourish all human beings to 
flourish in this world and in the next world that    
[2:17:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8266) these six fundamental things have to be protected 
and one of them we see is lineage and to protect    
[2:17:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8272) lineage and the sanctity and integrity 
of the family structure sexuality must be    
[2:17:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8278) tightly confined to it and so the rules regarding 
extramarital intercourse are actually very strict    
[2:18:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8282) and very severe because it's considered not only a 
sin but also social crime right that's potentially    
[2:18:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8288) uh adjudicable you know can potentially be uh 
you know punished in a court of law it's very    
[2:18:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8293) difficult to implement certain of the you know 
stiffer penalties but conceptually you know we    
[2:18:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8298) don't have this notion okay my sexual behavior 
is just my own private affair no that's modern    
[2:18:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8302) secular individualism it's not it's not realistic 
either because our sexual behavior is it has    
[2:18:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8308) ripple effects and it does affect society and it 
affects many other people other than our ourselves    
[2:18:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8312) and so islam recognizes that and legislates 
accordingly what are the consequences of zina so    
[2:18:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8317) extramural sex so the main reason the scholars say 
this has been prohibited is because it leads to    
[2:18:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8323) the mixing of lineage what they call halt and 
that you're mixing lineage and you're obscuring    
[2:18:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8329) you know who uh who who uh belongs to whom into 
what family and this is considered fundamental    
[2:18:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8336) for our identity as human beings and also for 
our social relationships so many rights and    
[2:19:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8340) duties in traditional societies and in islam you 
know devolve upon a person through their actual    
[2:19:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8346) blood relations and so it's very important for 
me to know if i'm a man is this my child or not    
[2:19:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8350) that i have to spend on right who do i inherit 
from i inherit from my relatives i have to know    
[2:19:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8355) who they are right and families you know again 
a lot of studies on this even by secular like    
[2:19:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8360) western secular anthropologists and uh scientists 
and others you know uh about how we naturally    
[2:19:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8367) prefer our own kind of lineage over those who are 
outside of it right this is natural it's part of    
[2:19:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8372) the fitzwa that we've been created with so the 
consequences of zen are premarital sex right we    
[2:19:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8377) didn't get the homosexuality yet this is an aspect 
of it but even between men and women it undermines    
[2:19:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8382) the institution of marriage which leads to the 
breakdown of the family unit and by extension the    
[2:19:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8386) breakdown of society so that's massive consequence 
it's not just a personal issue and also right    
[2:19:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8392) beyond the pragmatic and sort of sociological uh 
uh repercussions it has grave consequences for    
[2:19:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8399) one's personal virtue one's moral character and 
one standing before allah and all of these are    
[2:20:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8404) relevant to us and and important right and 
they determine our state and on the day of    
[2:20:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8409) judgement and in our uh eternal afterlife right 
and so norms for minimizing zina how does islam    
[2:20:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8416) attempt to legislate in order to minimize the 
occurrence of zina and make it a realizable moral    
[2:20:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8421) norm for the average man and woman to actually 
avoid non-marital intercourse well as we read    
[2:20:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8428) in the quran and tell the believing men to lower 
their gaze and to guard their private parts and    
[2:20:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8433) then it goes on and tell the believing women to 
lower their gaze and guard their private parts    
[2:20:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8437) so uh you know not looking at other people with 
sexual lust and also covering our bodies and    
[2:20:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8443) maintaining modesty we saw before two three slides 
earlier that the prophet peace be upon him said    
[2:20:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8448) every religion has a characteristic moral trait 
and the characteristic trait of islam is modesty    
[2:20:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8452) so muslims are known for their very intense 
sense of modesty also no physical contact between    
[2:20:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8458) non-machrams meaning men and women who are not so 
closely related that they could not marry so any    
[2:21:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8463) woman who's you know not your mother or sister 
whatever you should have no physical contact if    
[2:21:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8467) you're not actually married to her or a close 
relative so there's not just not premarital sex    
[2:21:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8472) in islam there's no pre-mental physical contact 
at all that's the actual ruling it can sometimes    
[2:21:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8477) be difficult especially handshakes and so forth 
but this is the the principle also no between    
[2:21:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8482) which means a man and a woman who are not you 
know closely related they should not be alone    
[2:21:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8488) in an isolated place where they fear um uh 
unannounced intrusion okay and the idea is    
[2:21:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8494) not that oh muslims think every time the men and 
women are alone together just gonna hit the floor    
[2:21:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8498) and lose control but the idea is that you 
are putting yourself in temptations way    
[2:21:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8501) and you know it's a very volatile aspect 
of human life and when you open yourself to    
[2:21:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8505) that temptation sometimes it just comes and gets 
you from where you least expect it and you fall    
[2:21:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8509) you think you're controlling control and you can 
completely lose control it can be very dangerous    
[2:21:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8514) also modest address speech and behavior for both 
men and women so these are the norms right um is    
[2:22:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8521) zenna the only thing that's forbidden in the realm 
of sexuality so there's a um there's a ruling or    
[2:22:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8527) a principle actually in islamic law which says 
all things are permissible by default and also    
[2:22:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8533) that everything that you a human being could do 
is by permissive by default permissible unless    
[2:22:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8540) revelation has come and specifically prohibited 
it but when it comes to sexuality and sexual    
[2:22:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8545) behavior it's the opposite principle sexual 
matters are forbidden by default they're haram    
[2:22:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8552) unless they're specifically permitted so 
sexual behavior by default is not permitted    
[2:22:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8557) and except where it has been specifically 
legislated and permitted and where is that    
[2:22:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8563) sexual relations between a man and a woman bound 
by an islamically valid contract of marriage    
[2:22:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8569) it says important except your spouses and those 
whom your right hands possess in our day we this    
[2:22:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8574) category doesn't exist it's spouses so i put here 
you know valid contract of marriage right valid    
[2:22:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8579) islamically valid contract uh marriage contract 
between a man and a woman so what is prohibited    
[2:23:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8584) everything else okay so if you're not men and 
woman you're not married then any sexual activity    
[2:23:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8590) or if you're obviously two men or two women you 
can't be a man and a woman married if you're two    
[2:23:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8594) men and two women right so everything else would 
be prohibited sexual acts short of intercourse    
[2:23:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8599) right if you're not within that relationship anal 
intercourse categorically prohibited even between    
[2:23:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8605) a man and a woman in marriage that prohibition 
on on lee white or an intercourse is for    
[2:23:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8609) all people not just for uh gays it's for exactly 
absolutely it's a it's a blanket prohibition right    
[2:23:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8616) you know the the rectal cavity is not the place 
where the male organ was designed to go period i    
[2:23:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8622) mean again we believe these things were designed 
with a purpose but yeah yeah indeed right it's    
[2:23:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8627) not meant to go there and that's it's considered 
a gross misuse of the body to to put it there and    
[2:23:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8632) so it's not permitted even between a husband 
and wife um and then exposing one's aura or    
[2:23:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8638) one's private parts to other than one's spouse 
without need such as medical and so forth and    
[2:24:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8643) we know the audit for the man is from the naval 
to the knee and for the woman you know there's    
[2:24:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8647) different levels of it all of the body except the 
face and hands in front of non-manageable nails    
[2:24:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8651) a more relaxed hour in front of family members 
and women and so forth but the idea is that    
[2:24:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8655) you cover your body especially your primary sex 
organs you know you don't uncover them except in    
[2:24:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8661) it for need right so muslims don't have you know 
are not supposed to have like open kind of locker    
[2:24:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8666) rooms and people walking around naked and so 
forth this would be considered a breach of islamic    
[2:24:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8671) morals and etiquette masturbation according to 
the majority also prohibited so solo sex so the    
[2:24:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8677) idea here is that sex is meant to be somehow by 
designed to be inherently heterosexual obviously    
[2:24:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8682) men and women but also inherently interactive 
right and so uh engaging in sexual behavior by    
[2:24:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8687) oneself according to the majority right is there 
some discussion about it is also prohibited right    
[2:24:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8693) um obviously this has nothing to do with consent 
because you know actions like that are obviously    
[2:24:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8697) consensual i mean xena also is consensual so 
this modern fixation on consent is not relevant    
[2:25:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8703) i'm not saying you can force someone to have sex 
with you i mean but i'm just saying the presence    
[2:25:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8707) of consent does not render a sexual act licit 
if it's otherwise prohibited i mean that would    
[2:25:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8711) be ridiculous um and so in addition anything that 
leads systematically that systematically threatens    
[2:25:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8717) to lead to illicit relations like touching gazing 
you know with the eyes being alone you know    
[2:25:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8724) with a person the opposite sex immodest speech 
dress or behavior all of these things are also    
[2:25:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8728) prohibited because they can lead down this 
very slippery slope and it says in accordance    
[2:25:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8734) doesn't just say don't commit sin it says don't 
even come close to zen don't even get near it    
[2:25:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8738) right um what does it mean in the shady 
yard to protect family and lineage right    
[2:25:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8744) again i sort of said this the extended family is 
normative so consider inheritance laws a person    
[2:25:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8748) dies you can bequeath one-third of your wealth to 
non-errors but then the rest of it devolves upon    
[2:25:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8753) your close relatives according to pre-determined 
shares so it's it the re your wealth resorts to    
[2:25:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8759) its rightful owner which is god and then it's d 
dis redistributed amongst your close relatives    
[2:26:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8764) according to the standards of revelation right 
which is also why it's important who am i related    
[2:26:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8769) to who has a right in my inheritance or who's 
to whose inheritance do i have a right these are    
[2:26:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8774) important questions blood ties through lineage 
and therefore natural reproduction is of prime    
[2:26:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8780) importance this is very critical consequently 
and this is important too the prohibition    
[2:26:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8784) of most means of artificial reproduction are 
prohibited in islam as being tantamount to zina    
[2:26:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8792) now this doesn't make sense from a western 
perspective why so what does this mean a    
[2:26:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8797) man and a woman are married okay the woman 
has healthy eggs the man has healthy sperm    
[2:26:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8803) but maybe her fallopian tubes are blocked so the 
sperm can't get to the egg so they can't conceive    
[2:26:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8807) naturally in this case a married man and a woman 
healthy eggs healthy sperm she carries the baby    
[2:26:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8813) in this case alone the doctor can artificially 
inseminate by the majority and implant the baby    
[2:27:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8820) the the zygote in the woman she carries a baby and 
gives birth to it so the doctor helped but what    
[2:27:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8826) the baby's born of a married mother and father 
and his biological mother also carried him this    
[2:27:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8832) is the natural way this is the way that god set 
up for humans to reproduce that cannot be breached    
[2:27:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8838) so sperm donor from outside the couple egg donor 
from outside the couple surrogate mother all of    
[2:27:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8843) these are prohibited because they are seen as 
bringing about the effects of zina by crossing    
[2:27:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8848) lineage and blurring natural family lines and 
one thing that's relevant to this discussion    
[2:27:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8855) we often hear because technology now allows 
for this kind of artificial reproduction    
[2:27:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8859) right technology is never its own moral argument 
it's never just because we can do something    
[2:27:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8865) doesn't mean that we should and whether we do or 
do not use technology or use in a particular way    
[2:27:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8871) comes back to your moral system and for our us 
as muslims the sharia is our moral system and it    
[2:27:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8876) you know it allows me to be sitting in boston view 
in london and we're conversing using this modern    
[2:28:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8881) technology no scholar would say this is a problem 
but it doesn't but because we have the ability to    
[2:28:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8887) artificially reproduce right here they 
say no the shadiana this is a central    
[2:28:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8891) domain of it and it forbids this type of 
tampering with the natural reproductive  
[2:28:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8898) you know sunnah that allah has set up in human 
reproduction this is this is life itself you can't    
[2:28:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8903) play with this and in our society many people say 
well you know technology has basically flattened    
[2:28:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8910) the playing field between gay and straight 
couples because now you can have gay marriages or    
[2:28:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8916) lesbian and they can just have artificial means of 
reproduction have their own families we say no no    
[2:28:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8921) no those means of reproduction are forbidden even 
for heterosexual couples so the fact that you're    
[2:28:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8926) trying to justify these new arrangements based on 
that technology what a technology we don't even    
[2:28:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8931) accept it to begin with so it's not an argument 
in your favor at least from our perspective right    
[2:28:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8936) further islamic principles related to gender there 
are two genders many verse in the quran we saw    
[2:29:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8943) he created the male and the female there is this 
notion of an intersex person born physiologically    
[2:29:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8949) with ambiguous gender this has been known since 
time eternal in the sharia talks about that this    
[2:29:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8955) is not psychological gender dysphoria which is 
different someone who has an unambiguously male    
[2:29:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8960) or female body is considered by the sharian to 
be a male or female a man or a woman accordingly    
[2:29:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8965) so biological sex and psychological gender you 
know this distinction which came about in the    
[2:29:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8971) 70s 60s 70s 80s this is not something that we 
as muslims you know would uh would run with    
[2:29:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8978) right this idea that your biological sex and your 
psychological gender okay they might be disparate    
[2:29:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8983) but normatively they should be they should line 
up these are not free-floating variables and we    
[2:29:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8988) said this earlier if you're male and have a male 
body the norm is that you would actually identify    
[2:29:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8993) as a man now maybe you don't that's gender 
dysphoria that's gender identity disorder    
[2:29:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=8997) we can deal with that but it doesn't mean that 
there is no sort of normative connection between    
[2:30:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9002) the physical body and the psychological gender 
right now something also very important and    
[2:30:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9008) this you know is going to be uncomfortable for 
many contemporary muslims especially in the west    
[2:30:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9012) deliberate imitation of the opposite sex is 
forbidden specifically in dress and affectations    
[2:30:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9018) and there's a famous hadith which is narrated in 
several different variations that uh actually not    
[2:30:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9024) god is cursed but that the prophet said the 
prophet cursed men who deliberately imitate    
[2:30:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9030) women and women who deliberately imitate men okay 
now what does this mean deliberately imitate it's    
[2:30:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9036) very important that we understand deliberately 
imitating because there can be men and islam is    
[2:30:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9042) realistic there can be men who are more effeminate 
by nature in their speech in their you know um    
[2:30:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9049) mannerisms in the way they behave there 
could be women who are kind of more masculine    
[2:30:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9053) by nature this is not what's being talked about 
here it's the ones who deliberately imitate who    
[2:30:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9059) take on by design the characteristics that are 
known in a particular society to belong to the    
[2:31:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9064) other sects so exactly early on with you those 
drag queens that go into uh school yeah drugs    
[2:31:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9070) between story hours really uh dressed up in the 
most outrageous uh women's clothes and that is    
[2:31:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9076) very deliberate because it's completely unnatural 
i mean it's very artificial but that would be an    
[2:31:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9081) example of deliberately imitating women or 
a certain very crude and exaggerated uh uh    
[2:31:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9087) imitation of women i don't think any normal woman 
would look like that but anyway so that's actually    
[2:31:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9091) a good example yeah right right and the idea is 
that you can always you know decide how you dress    
[2:31:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9097) right you might not be able to control your gait 
or your mannerisms or your speech but you know    
[2:31:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9102) you can always choose what to wear and so actually 
as buhari one of the main phrase collectors he put    
[2:31:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9107) this hadith in the chapter on dress in his book 
so the you know this was understood as really    
[2:31:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9114) again things that you can consciously um that 
you can consciously control so what about those    
[2:31:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9119) who fall outside of this binary right um and so 
this comes up again these are real and we're going    
[2:32:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9124) to get into this now very shortly these are real 
conditions that people might you know we said they    
[2:32:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9130) might actually feel psychologically um not in line 
with the body right so what do we do about this    
[2:32:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9135) so we say sex gender identity and expression 
and sexual orientation should normatively line    
[2:32:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9141) up in other words they are quote unquote meant 
to line up that is the normal thing right and it    
[2:32:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9146) is the normative thing so this gender-bred 
person which we'll see again in a minute    
[2:32:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9150) right where gender is you know sex male female 
gender man woman sexual orientation gay straight    
[2:32:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9157) gender expression you know masculine feminine 
these are all considered like four free-floating    
[2:32:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9162) variables they may or may not match up and you 
can mix and match however you want and it's all    
[2:32:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9166) they're all equally normatively fine we would say 
no right normatively they should all line up but    
[2:32:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9171) we understand that for some people they won't and 
people are not morally responsible for that to the    
[2:32:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9177) extent that it's not something that they have 
chosen or brought about to on themselves right    
[2:33:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9182) um so exceptions to the rule like you know 
misalignment do not undermine the rule itself    
[2:33:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9188) that is the normativity of things like what the 
normativity of the male female gender binary    
[2:33:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9194) absolutely central to the way god has created 
us as human beings as he says in the quran right    
[2:33:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9200) also it does not undermine the normativity of the 
expectation of broad conformity to the behavioral    
[2:33:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9204) norms dress and mannerisms of one's natal 
sex or gender right and we're not allowed to    
[2:33:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9209) imitate the opposite sex um uh willfully right and 
this also does not undermine the normativity of    
[2:33:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9216) opposite sex attraction and within marriage 
opposite sex sexual expression doesn't mean    
[2:33:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9221) everyone necessarily falls into that but the fact 
that some people might not be attracted to the    
[2:33:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9225) opposite sex and they might be attracted to their 
own sex that doesn't undermine the normativity of    
[2:33:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9230) opposite sex attraction so does that make it 
quote-unquote heteronormative yes obviously we    
[2:33:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9236) would not consider that a term of abuse but it's 
used as a there'd be a virtue rather than a yeah    
[2:34:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9243) right yeah right now very important question and 
again we are wrapping up so i i uh paul i can tell    
[2:34:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9249) i know you've been traveling so i i'm sorry to to 
go on for so long now this is uh extremely helpful    
[2:34:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9255) and useful please continue am i sinful for feeling 
attracted to my own sex or not identifying with my    
[2:34:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9260) own gender right am i sinful just for having those 
feelings whether it's i'm attracted to my own    
[2:34:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9265) gender you know erotically or sexually or i don't 
you know um identify with my with my actual sex    
[2:34:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9272) right there's a key islamic principle and this is 
very important for especially for people who are    
[2:34:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9276) you know not as familiar with how these 
issues play out in people's actual lives right    
[2:34:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9281) key islamic principle you are morally responsible 
only for what you have control over right  
[2:34:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9290) that god does not bear does not burden a soul 
with greater than it can bear you are not called    
[2:34:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9296) to account for what you don't have control over so 
if you are despite yourself you find that you are    
[2:35:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9301) attracted to your own sex right you are not 
responsible for those feelings to the extent that    
[2:35:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9308) you did not choose those and people who experience 
that general don't choose that it's not something    
[2:35:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9312) you choose it's something that you kind of 
experience and you discover within yourself    
[2:35:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9315) so you're not morally responsible just for 
having those feelings right it doesn't mean that    
[2:35:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9320) okay you fantasize and you you know whatever 
you you have ways and then you can live in    
[2:35:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9324) ways that might you know encourage right that's 
different those are things you're choosing to do    
[2:35:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9328) but just the very kind of base fact that okay i 
i discover when i became a teenager that you know    
[2:35:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9334) i'm erotically attracted to my own sex rather than 
the other sex this does not make you a evil person    
[2:35:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9339) or a sinful muslim or let alone a non-muslim of 
course not you're not if you don't have control    
[2:35:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9345) over you're not morally responsible however right 
so merely experiencing same-sex attractions or    
[2:35:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9351) gender identity disorder or dysphoria does not 
constitute a sin and this as far as i know is sort    
[2:35:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9357) of agreed upon i mean all scholars would agree 
with this however right we are still responsible    
[2:36:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9362) for our actions because you choose your actions 
specifically refraining from sexual behavior    
[2:36:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9370) right or deliberate imitation or impersonation 
of the opposite sex right cross-dressing you know    
[2:36:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9375) socially transitioning to the other sex chemically 
or surgically transitioning also these are    
[2:36:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9381) by consensus of muslim scholars sunni muslim 
scholars are forbidden there is some difference    
[2:36:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9386) of opinion uh within shiite circles based on 
the facts were given by the late ayatollah    
[2:36:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9392) the leader of the iranian revolution who died 
in 1989 many shiite scholars don't accept that    
[2:36:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9397) you know that permission but there is some 
discussion there but among sunni scholars    
[2:36:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9402) there is a consensus that gender transitioning 
is is prohibited it doesn't mean there's not a    
[2:36:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9408) recognition that people can have gender dysphoria 
but it means that it is not permissible to try to    
[2:36:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9414) deal with that by changing the body um and so 
this gender bred person i told you we would meet    
[2:37:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9420) him again and i already talked about it so sexual 
orientation you know heterosexual homozygous scale    
[2:37:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9426) biological sex female male intersex right it's 
real there's the intersex condition that's been    
[2:37:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9431) dealt with in the shadia gender expression you 
can be either feminine or expression masculine    
[2:37:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9435) or androgynous gender identity woman man 
genderqueer and these are children are    
[2:37:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9440) being taught this now right so your sex is your 
gonads like you know your genitalia basically    
[2:37:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9446) orientation is who you're attracted to and 
romantically and sexually that's in your heart    
[2:37:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9450) identity is how you identify in your brain as a 
man or a woman and your gender expression is you    
[2:37:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9456) know the body how you interact and present and 
again the sharia regulates this it's not up to    
[2:37:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9463) you as a person to just kind of again take this 
to the psychologization of the south well i feel    
[2:37:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9468) this internally therefore i'm an inauthentic 
person unless i'm allowed to just do this    
[2:37:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9473) right and if you don't accept me as a muslim 
community and you don't accept my gender    
[2:37:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9477) expression or my gender identity or my sexual 
orientation i.e acting upon it in ways that are    
[2:38:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9481) well you've undermined my dignity right and 
that's sort of how that moral discourse goes we    
[2:38:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9486) say no no no no that's not what our conception 
of the human being is based on to begin with    
[2:38:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9491) you're importing a completely foreign ideology 
and a completely foreign world view into islam  
[2:38:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9498) um okay i'm not gonna i mean i 
already talked about this a little bit    
[2:38:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9506) when it comes to gender non-conformity right 
and we are really almost done here when it comes    
[2:38:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9510) to gender non-conformity uh scholars recognize 
that there is a conventional component right a    
[2:38:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9516) component to what counts as male versus female uh 
you know uh dress interest behavior there's some    
[2:38:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9523) socially quote unquote socially kind of influence 
or socially constructed component but nevertheless    
[2:38:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9528) all societies differentiate between males and 
females so if i go back to 18th century america    
[2:38:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9533) and look at the way the founding fathers of this 
country dress they had these big furly wigs you    
[2:38:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9538) know i mean like curly long curly hair these 
frilly blouses and tights like stockings and for    
[2:39:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9544) us if you dress that way they're going to think 
you're dressed in drag that's very feminine for us    
[2:39:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9548) today but in their time that's how men dressed 
so that's conventional but that's not how women    
[2:39:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9553) dressed at their time the women there there's 
very billowing dresses and the you know whatever    
[2:39:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9558) so the men and women dressed differently they 
didn't dress the same even in our age even just    
[2:39:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9562) like unisex like i'm wearing what i'm wearing and 
what you're wearing is clearly men's clothing you    
[2:39:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9567) know woman's blouse is always cut like curved and 
you know it's always different like men and women    
[2:39:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9571) are not the same right so there's some cultural 
component to that but the idea is that whatever is    
[2:39:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9577) largely generally recognized as being masculine 
or feminine in your society you're actually bound    
[2:39:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9582) in the sharia to sort of conform to that well can 
i just be my own autonomous individual and throw    
[2:39:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9587) off the shackles of society no i mean that 
that's russo that's the 19th century that's    
[2:39:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9592) secular european psychologization of the self and 
radical autonomy that's not islam right so choose    
[2:39:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9598) your paradigm choose your religion but you know 
don't try to mix the two they're not the same    
[2:40:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9603) dress as we said strictly forbidden on the 
basis of the hadith quoted to imitate the    
[2:40:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9608) opposite sex and dress accoutrements etc 
as conventionally recognized in one society    
[2:40:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9614) what about mannerisms i'm a male i have a high 
voice or i kind of have effeminate you know    
[2:40:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9619) walk or you know hand movements right um the 
scholars actually again this is a phenomenon    
[2:40:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9624) we see this in society right a man could be even 
heterosexual but kind of effeminate right it's    
[2:40:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9629) this or a woman could be kind of masculine and 
all right scholars recognize that a person could    
[2:40:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9634) have gender atypical mannerisms gate voice 
etc um the man would be called muhammad    
[2:40:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9640) right that's a male with effeminate mannerisms 
and a woman a female with masculine mannerisms    
[2:40:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9645) what did the scholars say about this right they 
said these these mannerisms they could be either    
[2:40:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9651) which means constitutional like the 
person's just it's natural to that person    
[2:40:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9655) or it could be affected like they're taking it on 
their they're purposely doing it we know if it's    
[2:41:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9661) purposeful then that's forbidden we've already 
seen that right so purposely effect affecting    
[2:41:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9666) such mannerisms is harambe consensus however if 
it comes to somebody naturally right effeminate    
[2:41:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9671) tendencies to a man or sort of more masculine 
you know to a woman right the scholars here    
[2:41:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9678) have differed some of them said that the person 
should try to recondition himself or herself    
[2:41:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9684) you know try to make reasonable efforts to bring 
their behavior more in line with what's typical of    
[2:41:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9689) their sex and if they don't try to then they're 
sinful for not trying but if they try to and    
[2:41:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9694) they can't do it after a reasonable effort then 
the blame drops and you know that's fine okay    
[2:41:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9699) other scholars said they're not even obligated to 
even attempt as long as it came to them naturally    
[2:41:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9703) and they didn't deliberately do it they don't 
have to it would normally make your life probably    
[2:41:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9707) easier just socially speaking especially for a 
man you know i mean there's a particular stigma    
[2:41:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9712) in most societies against effeminate men often 
you know it'd probably make one's life easier    
[2:41:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9716) you know to to kind of rehabituate if possible 
some people might find that very difficult and    
[2:42:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9721) if they do then they're actually not blamed 
for that and they should not be um made fun    
[2:42:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9725) of it would actually be haram to do that they 
should not be categorized as being any particular    
[2:42:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9730) way or it should not be assumed that they 
engage in particular sexual behavior like    
[2:42:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9734) same-sex behavior just because they might appear 
as feminine right this is these are all this is    
[2:42:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9739) all fun which is kind of um suspicious thinking 
of someone and this is actually haram to to to    
[2:42:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9747) have that in islam okay interests and behavior 
islam is not super prescriptive when it comes to    
[2:42:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9753) thing like things like personal likes and dislikes 
right girls being more into sports or bricolage    
[2:42:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9759) boys being interested in using an art or cooking 
okay might not be that typical of your sex    
[2:42:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9763) but as long as the activity itself is not 
forbidden there is no particular stigma    
[2:42:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9767) you know i mean one can pursue one's interest so 
there is a latitude there and the sona has lots    
[2:42:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9773) of examples of things that in our society modern 
west or whatever you know we might consider out    
[2:42:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9777) of character men crying profusely right also the 
prophet peace be upon him was not above domestic    
[2:43:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9782) tests in seventh century arabia sweeping the floor 
mending his own socks right we don't say oh that's    
[2:43:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9787) just women's work well okay maybe more typically 
but it doesn't mean that you know it's beneath a    
[2:43:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9792) man for example our prophet peace be upon him did 
this right uh important we don't have an idea of    
[2:43:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9797) womanhood that is akin to the victorian notion of 
the kind of dainty delicate fainting female you    
[2:43:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9804) know like ah like so frail and weak and we don't 
really see that in islam like okay men and women    
[2:43:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9809) aren't the same men in general are stronger 
than women physically i mean obviously that's    
[2:43:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9813) that's not really disputable but this idea that 
women are these kind of fragile porcelain kind of    
[2:43:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9818) like fainting you know this is not really i mean 
even in the west i mean you could say like that's    
[2:43:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9824) uh you know localizable to particular time 
periods and cultures but you know we don't    
[2:43:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9828) have this in islam what counts as appropriate 
same-sex interaction is largely conventional    
[2:43:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9834) many muslim men you know as that people know are 
very touchy-feely compared to men in the west    
[2:43:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9838) they're constantly hugging and kissing and you 
know many eastern societies walking hand in hand    
[2:44:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9842) even sometimes with you know their fingers crossed 
and this in the west you know i mean this would    
[2:44:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9848) clearly be you know you'd say okay well they're 
they're gay if two men are walking like that    
[2:44:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9852) in the east um you know this is not taken to be uh 
sexual at all it's just you know friends are very    
[2:44:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9859) you know close they have close physical you know 
kind of contact um however this is changing as    
[2:44:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9864) western norms continue to dominate the world and 
propagate themselves through media and technology    
[2:44:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9870) i was told that you know when i was in cairo 
in the mid 90s it was very common for men to    
[2:44:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9874) walk around with all social classes holding 
hands in the streets and hooking arms and    
[2:44:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9878) i was told that no one does that anymore in 
cairo so i i actually asked a friend of mine    
[2:44:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9883) who's an academic in cairo professor there 
and he said exactly what you said he lives    
[2:44:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9888) there now yeah yeah exactly and and this is not 
good news because it means the entire western    
[2:44:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9893) sexual paradigm is becoming deeply imbibed even 
by muslims abroad now in the muslim world right    
[2:44:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9899) um and now you have cairo youth saying oh well 
that's gay you know to walk holding my friend what    
[2:45:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9904) do you mean gay like we don't have that concept 
in islam we're not that concept we have actions    
[2:45:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9908) we don't have a sexual identity to begin with 
well but guess what they're taking it on because    
[2:45:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9913) you know again western norms are very aggressively 
pushed as the only valid ones and western culture    
[2:45:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9919) continues to dominate through its products movies 
television cinema the internet and so forth    
[2:45:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9924) and so muslims are not you know exempt from being 
uh affected by this but we should be aware of it    
[2:45:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9930) because it's not innocent right it has 
implications um there are clear islamic guidelines    
[2:45:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9934) that transcend culture right so we said there 
was a cultural element as to what is appropriate    
[2:45:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9938) same-sex interaction that's not without limits 
so again we've seen there's a prohibition of    
[2:45:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9943) seeing or touching the aura or private parts of 
someone of the same sex specifically particularly    
[2:45:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9949) prohibited in the hadith to lie naked together 
together under one sheet even if the lights are    
[2:45:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9953) off because well you know i mean that's a very 
precarious position to be in so there are clear    
[2:45:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9958) islamic guidelines that kind of transcend 
culture but within these guidelines cultures    
[2:46:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9962) can differ on these things intersex individuals 
there's a you know quite extensive uh islamic    
[2:46:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9972) discussion of of the junta the intersex individual 
i will not talk about it here we have plenty of    
[2:46:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9976) work and i'll show in the resources you can read a 
lot about this topic gender identities disorder um    
[2:46:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9983) again it would be seen more as a psychological 
or emotional condition it's not a third sex    
[2:46:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9987) or a woman a actual woman actually trapped in 
a man's body this is kind of a foreign concept    
[2:46:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9992) but it would be seen as a a psychological 
or emotional mismatch between the body which    
[2:46:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=9997) again can be very acute very painful very real for 
people but the idea is how do we deal with it and    
[2:46:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10002) how do we conceptualize it um and we said hormonal 
and surgical transition procedures are not    
[2:46:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10008) permitted islamically all right the last 
leg are we good to go yes please all right    
[2:46:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10015) so what is homosexuality right we figured wasn't 
this what the whole talk was about well yes and    
[2:47:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10021) we've been building up to this and hopefully 
again all the pieces will fall into place    
[2:47:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10025) what is homosexuality the contemporary 
background we always have to question our terms    
[2:47:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10029) there's a principle in the sharian that one can 
only judge a thing when it is properly conceived  
[2:47:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10038) so if you want to say what something is or 
isn't or you know give a moral judgment or    
[2:47:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10043) legal we have to have a conceptualization first 
of what is it so when you say homosexuality    
[2:47:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10047) what is that i don't even know what that is i 
don't have an arabic word for it so what is it    
[2:47:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10051) lgbt you know again i put it in quotation marks in 
the beginning because i'm questioning the category    
[2:47:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10056) right i i can't translate that into islamic terms 
so we have to understand what we're talking about    
[2:47:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10062) so homosexuality in contemporary parliaments and 
even the word homosexuality now is old-fashioned    
[2:47:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10067) and considered offensive by many people and 
like the lgbt uh you know uh who identify    
[2:47:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10073) as lgbt i think it's fine i mean it's just purely 
uh clinical it's it's like science homosexuality    
[2:47:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10079) same sex that's all it means but anyway and i 
prefer to use it because it's not our term we    
[2:48:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10084) don't have a term that is exactly similar to 
that in classical islamic terms i mean there    
[2:48:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10089) are neologisms that that translate homosexuality 
into very arabic but i think homosexuality is more    
[2:48:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10095) neutral than lgbt which carries a lot of political 
and social baggage and best for muslims to avoid    
[2:48:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10101) you know using lgbt as a term especially 
internally right because it brings a lot of    
[2:48:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10107) baggage and a lot of assumptions with it that 
that you know we would need to vet into and to be    
[2:48:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10113) critical of so homosexuality in 
contemporary parlance it usually refers to    
[2:48:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10119) feelings of romantic and or sexual attraction 
to member members of one's own sex that's one    
[2:48:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10125) element of it another element engaging in on 
the basis of these feelings engaging in romantic    
[2:48:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10131) relationships and or sexual behavior with members 
of one's own sex so we saw this before action    
[2:48:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10136) or attractions and desires and then behavior 
that follows thereupon and then third adopting    
[2:49:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10142) a personal and social identity based on such 
feelings and or relationships and acts so these    
[2:49:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10148) are three things which again traditionally for us 
as muslims and also in the west have been separate    
[2:49:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10153) your attractions are one thing you're not a 
specific category of human beings just because    
[2:49:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10157) you might feel a particular attraction even if 
you act on it it's an act you do not something    
[2:49:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10161) you are but in the contemporary paradigm all of 
those are fused together you know inextricably    
[2:49:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10167) you're attracted you act upon it and that is 
who you are it's the basis of your identity    
[2:49:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10170) so we have to be very careful as muslims not to 
take on terminology which brings on board with it    
[2:49:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10176) this inextricability because we have to keep these 
separate otherwise you know islam makes no sense    
[2:49:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10182) and we cannot operationalize our categories 
of thought or our categories if we do that    
[2:49:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10189) so modern culture again it amalgamates these 
three into one i am gay lesbian queer right    
[2:49:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10195) it's something that i am not something that i feel 
not something that i do this is again very new and    
[2:50:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10200) culturally specific to the modern west homosexual 
sentiment and behavior is widely attested or why    
[2:50:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10206) they are tested in past societies but were never 
taken as an identity this is very particular to    
[2:50:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10211) the current cultural moment right and is therefore 
contingent upon that moment i.e it was something    
[2:50:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10215) that you did not something that you were again 
that's a good take-home message you know like    
[2:50:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10220) phrase to remember right and then there's the 
illusion of any meaningful distinction between    
[2:50:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10226) or sorry the illusion of any meaningful 
distinction between desires and actions is    
[2:50:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10230) morally problematic so eliding means to get rid 
of right when you say well just because i have    
[2:50:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10234) a desire i can act upon it well if you apply that 
consistently you're going to run to a lot of moral    
[2:50:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10239) problems and very uh very quickly right so of 
course the mere existence of a desire can never be    
[2:50:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10247) a moral justification for acting upon it we 
need other moral criteria brought to bear on it    
[2:50:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10252) for the contemporary post-sexual 
revolution west what's the criterion    
[2:50:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10256) consent as long as you're consent no problem for 
us as muslims that's never the criteria criteria    
[2:51:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10261) is what you know when god and his messenger 
decide upon something it's not for believing or    
[2:51:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10266) not for believing men or women when god and his 
messenger have decided on something to have a    
[2:51:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10271) choice in the matter right that's our criteria so 
we look to revelation to see what god has actually    
[2:51:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10275) permitted and prohibited of various desires that 
we might have um and so considering homosexuality    
[2:51:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10281) a question of identity rather than a question 
of acts fundamentally alters the conversation    
[2:51:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10288) and this is very important because the modern 
west right just assumes that it is a question of    
[2:51:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10293) identity and insists on treating it and speaking 
about it and conceptualizing it in that way    
[2:51:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10299) and and and therefore the deck is already 
stacked against anyone who's coming from    
[2:51:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10304) a different paradigm which says no no no 
i'm just i'm talking about specific acts    
[2:51:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10308) no but those acts are core to who i am so if 
you don't accept the acts and celebrate them    
[2:51:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10312) in your mosque and in your community then 
you are excluding me as an entire person    
[2:51:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10317) you're undermining me you're excluding you 
know uh not recognizing my dignity and so forth    
[2:52:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10325) so we saw this before right uh modern western 
culture it separates these things which should    
[2:52:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10329) be and are by nature together sex reproduction 
marriage morality and it also amalgamates desires    
[2:52:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10335) actions and identities should be separate and it 
puts them together so again this slide you know    
[2:52:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10339) take a mental picture keep that in mind this 
is really the key to unpacking a lot of this    
[2:52:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10344) very you know complex issues that come up you 
know there's a very good prism to to unlock and    
[2:52:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10350) untangle a lot of those knots um also and we 
talked about this it incorrectly separates iec's    
[2:52:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10356) as free-floating variables biological sex you 
know gender identity expression sexual orientation    
[2:52:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10362) we say no those should be aligned okay 
we understand that they might not be    
[2:52:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10366) okay and that's fine a person's not morally 
responsible for what they don't have control over    
[2:52:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10369) but normatively yes they should be aligned and 
we're not embarrassed to say that um while drawing    
[2:52:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10375) a false equivalence between race gender and 
sexual identity or behavior and throwing again    
[2:53:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10380) race gender and sexual lgbt all into one you know 
again we talked about why this is problematic um    
[2:53:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10388) okay versus on the people of lot we're just 
going to go through some of this very quickly    
[2:53:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10392) because someone might say how can you have such 
a long talk on lgbt and not talk about the verse    
[2:53:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10396) in the quran right because recently these these 
are usually the first go-to verses in for some    
[2:53:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10402) muslims when talking about this you simply refer 
to the verses of the people of lot uh none of the    
[2:53:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10407) proceeding discussion happens uh and sometimes 
it is relevant to just go to those verses i'm    
[2:53:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10412) not saying you shouldn't do that but these are 
this is usually how it happens just go straight    
[2:53:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10416) to the verses those particular ones without any 
other context or considerations whatsoever so    
[2:53:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10422) uh it's interesting you you're doing it this 
way without a lot of complex historical depth    
[2:53:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10426) uh and theoretical discussions and as you've 
done so eloquently so yeah sergeant dropped okay    
[2:53:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10432) all right and so we are almost there i do promise 
um all right so verses on the people of lot and    
[2:53:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10439) again there has been some uh contest contestation 
of the meaning of these verses by certain    
[2:54:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10445) you know uh secularly trained western academics 
muslim identifying western academics and you know    
[2:54:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10451) we'll read some of these verses and talk 
very briefly about it it's it's it's very    
[2:54:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10455) uh you know very thin but anyway um so so 
the people of lot also mentioned the bible is    
[2:54:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10462) mentioned in at least nine different places in the 
quran totaling over 75 verses so this story comes    
[2:54:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10467) up over and over and over again okay same-sex 
sexual relations between men particularly in    
[2:54:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10472) that story were the emblematic sin of lot's people 
okay the so every prophet he came you know that    
[2:54:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10479) his people had a specific sin that they were known 
for and this was the emblematic sin of the people    
[2:54:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10484) of thought other misdeeds are mentioned in a few 
verses actually i think just one right but quote    
[2:54:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10489) unquote approaching males with desire instead of 
females is the transgression that is mentioned    
[2:54:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10494) most often and in greatest detail with respect 
to the people of lot okay revisionists i just    
[2:55:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10500) mentioned they've tried to reinterpret the sin 
as one of rape or inhospitality to lot's guests    
[2:55:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10505) and we'll see why this is basically you know 
nonsensical um but the quran repeatedly mentions    
[2:55:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10512) the same-sex aspect of the act in particular as 
the defining feature of their iniquitous nature    
[2:55:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10517) and it's very clear that for example and mentioned 
lot when he said to his people do you commit    
[2:55:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10523) iniquity such as none in creation have committed 
before you okay what is this iniquity verily you    
[2:55:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10529) come with desire unto men instead of women nay you 
are a people transgressing beyond balance okay end    
[2:55:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10535) of story but the only reply this people was to say 
turn them out from your town truly they are people    
[2:55:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10540) who keep themselves pure and then it moves on so 
it's not rape it's not you know forcing it's not    
[2:55:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10547) you come to men with desire instead of women 
like if that's not clear that what's being    
[2:55:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10551) concentrated on here is the gender of the partner 
i don't i don't see how it could possibly be    
[2:55:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10556) clearer well i i think there is without going 
interest because this is very long but uh    
[2:56:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10561) i i personally i think the reason is many of 
people who argue this are drawing on uh christian    
[2:56:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10567) or jewish uh uh interpretations of this story in 
in genesis in the bible where the the the rape    
[2:56:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10576) theme is arguably there and and they're simply 
reading the chronic verses through the biblical    
[2:56:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10583) story which is actually in important respects 
different although there are many similarities as    
[2:56:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10587) well so they're basically using uh kind of a gay 
hermeneutic has been used to justify homosexuality    
[2:56:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10593) uh biblically and and just basically i recognize 
exactly the same arguments i'm familiar with the    
[2:56:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10599) um story and the attempts revisionist attempts 
to reinterpret it and they're basically copying    
[2:56:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10605) and pasting that and using it for the 
quran the quran's anarchy but as you    
[2:56:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10609) say the quran's narrative does actually 
have that quite distinctive feature of    
[2:56:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10613) you know that that they turn to to to males 
rather than females and that emphasis is not    
[2:56:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10617) as much in the bible as it is in the quran so 
they're basically taking that narrative from    
[2:57:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10625) christian revisionism and using it for 
the quran in a very kind of wooden way    
[2:57:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10629) without really attending to the the the nuances 
and the details of the quranic version and that's    
[2:57:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10635) very interesting but also it's you know in 
the christian jewish case it also is a case of    
[2:57:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10640) modern very contemporary reinterpretation right 
because oh yeah i don't think i want to stress i    
[2:57:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10644) don't think it works for the bible either actually 
i'm not saying oh it's just about raping the bible    
[2:57:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10649) no it's not i i think i think that that that is a 
uh easter jesus rather than into it their exegesis    
[2:57:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10656) agenda but nevertheless it's even less plausible 
with the quran if it ever was plausible in the    
[2:57:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10660) bible and there was also the story and we'll 
see it where the you know the angels come in    
[2:57:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10664) the form of young men to the lot's house and then 
the people come after so you could say well maybe    
[2:57:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10667) they're kind of trying to force but again it's 
very it's very uh and then and then there's some    
[2:57:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10672) extremely clear hadith obviously which are very 
specific about the act so um it's pretty uh uh    
[2:57:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10678) indisputable i think hard to get around yeah 
so um great so the next verse i'm not going to    
[2:58:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10685) read it because it's too long it's just to give 
context but again people will have these slides    
[2:58:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10689) you can go back and read it for yourself 
selves we'll just go to these last couple    
[2:58:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10693) ones to round this off and mention lot when 
he said to his people do you commit iniquity    
[2:58:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10698) with why with eyes wide open do you indeed 
come with desire unto men instead of women    
[2:58:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10703) nay but you are people behaving foolishly okay 
so again very specific what the problem is with    
[2:58:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10709) their behavior and then in another again 
so that was uh in sort of the number now    
[2:58:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10714) and mentioned lot when he said to his 
people you commit iniquity the same word    
[2:58:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10718) such as none and creation have created committed 
before you do you indeed come unto men and cut off    
[2:58:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10723) the road and practice evil deeds in your assembly 
so here we get two other things you know the    
[2:58:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10727) sort of highway robbery and then other types 
of unspecified evil deeds that they practice    
[2:58:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10731) in their assemblies which scholars have speculated 
on right um so here are some other sins but we saw    
[2:58:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10736) all these other cases it's like very specifically 
you know the same-sex uh nature of their act the    
[2:59:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10741) people the reply of his people is but to say 
bring upon us god's punishment if you are    
[2:59:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10745) among the truthful so they're quite haughty 
and sort of you know not very concerned that    
[2:59:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10751) this might bring on god's punishment as if they're 
challenging him and when our messengers and i just    
[2:59:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10755) met the angels came to lot he was anguished on 
their account and constrained from helping them    
[2:59:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10760) and he said this is a trying day and his people 
came hastening unto him and before they and before    
[2:59:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10767) that they had been working evil deeds he said 
lot said oh my people these are my daughters    
[2:59:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10772) they are purer for you so fear god and disgrace me 
not with respect to my guests is there not among    
[2:59:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10778) you a right-minded man they said you know well 
what that we have no claim on your daughters and    
[2:59:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10784) indeed you know what we want i eat your guests 
your guests your male guests now this is one of    
[2:59:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10789) the um you know uh verses that the revisionists 
will point to to say okay well look this is the    
[2:59:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10795) rape you know this is the implied rape scene and 
you say but wait a minute but lot's response is    
[3:00:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10800) these are my daughters right they're purer for 
you right so these are men here my daughters my    
[3:00:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10806) daughters are women what's the difference between 
the guests and the daughters it's their gender    
[3:00:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10810) and if you assume that these men want to rape the 
guests it's not reasonable to think lot is saying    
[3:00:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10815) well oh don't rape my guests because that's 
inhospitable but rape my daughter's instead    
[3:00:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10820) no doesn't make any sense i mean if that were the 
case so why does he why is he not blaming them for    
[3:00:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10826) wanting to rape why would he say take my daughters 
instead and then he says they're purer for you    
[3:00:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10830) and you don't say well you know um uh don't 
rape somebody because it's not pure to rape    
[3:00:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10836) someone like just have consensual sex because 
it's more pure like that that's not not how    
[3:00:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10840) anyone talks i mean when he says they're 
pure for you they're pure for you because    
[3:00:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10844) you're men and they're women and that's a pure act 
right not this act with these men it's it's like    
[3:00:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10849) super clear but again you know leave it up 
to academics to kind of complicate right um    
[3:00:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10856) and so anyway reinterpreting this as rape 
right in a classic is a classic example    
[3:01:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10864) of anachronistically projecting contemporary 
notions onto the texts such as this post-sexual    
[3:01:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10870) revolution fixation on consent as the only 
relevant criterion it's so obvious i mean    
[3:01:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10875) people say well wait a minute you know it must 
be that there's a lack of consent here because    
[3:01:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10880) that's the only thing that makes sense to us 
you know that's the only crime that we could    
[3:01:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10884) imagine is that there was just a lack of consent 
and therefore it must have been raped because    
[3:01:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10889) don't we all know that consent is really what 
matters when it comes to sexual behavior and    
[3:01:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10893) i mean this is like this is i mean this is 
obviously just you know taking like literally    
[3:01:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10898) the last three decades kind of you know a 
sexual measuring stick for sexual morality    
[3:01:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10905) and just projecting it thousands of years into the 
past and reading it into a text where it clearly    
[3:01:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10910) has nothing to do with it but yeah i i mean 
it's a bit of interesting uh john boswell the    
[3:01:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10915) american harvard uh professor uh uh um who wrote 
the the classic revisionist work from a christian    
[3:02:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10921) point of view on this story in the bible um in 
the 80s i think i mean he sadly died of aids    
[3:02:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10928) himself uh subsequently but um he he proposed 
that it's true with rape and and so on but    
[3:02:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10934) his work was then uh as as indeed um is often the 
case was critically assessed by biblical scholars    
[3:02:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10941) and was found to be very wanting and indeed 
the top experts now in the biblical field    
[3:02:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10947) except that this passage and solomon gomorrah 
passed you the lot passage and others do    
[3:02:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10951) speak of homosexual acts actually okay even though 
these owns these scholars themselves don't agree    
[3:02:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10959) with the bible and i think professor john barton 
who had the immense privilege of speaking to on    
[3:02:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10964) my channel professor of bible at oxford university 
when he was leading biblical scholars of the old    
[3:02:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10968) testament um he he has said this to me he he said 
no the the revisionist uh argument that is about    
[3:02:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10976) rape it's not real it's completely wrong 
it's not based on the hebrew text it it's    
[3:03:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10980) it's easter jesus rather exegesis but i professor 
john barton don't agree with the bible anyway    
[3:03:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10987) i mean so you know and this in fact the world's 
preeminent scholar in this field it's not john    
[3:03:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10992) barton it's a specialist in this area i forget 
the the scholar's name he's written the the    
[3:03:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=10997) scholarly text is usually seen as the defining 
uh clearly states the revisionist case has failed    
[3:03:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11003) and the traditional understanding is correct but 
this very author himself rejects it doesn't agree    
[3:03:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11010) with the bible because that they're very 
liberal or they view the bible as purely a    
[3:03:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11014) human construct like john barton they publicly 
does so you know the the traditional reading    
[3:03:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11020) is the correct one but many christians simply 
don't accept it anyway they'll say well we    
[3:03:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11024) don't agree with that we we have our own views 
we're modern people we accept the lgbt agenda    
[3:03:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11030) remarkable irony that the traditional 
reading actually wins at the end of the day    
[3:03:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11034) but people still disregard it anyway you know what 
i'd say paul at least be honest you know they're    
[3:03:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11039) being honest they're saying here's what the text 
says we can't make it say what it doesn't say    
[3:04:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11044) implausibly we might have wished it to 
say something different but it doesn't    
[3:04:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11048) and we don't agree with okay we're not going to 
follow it but okay but don't try to like play    
[3:04:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11053) games with what it actually says and this idea of 
like we can just read into it anything we want or    
[3:04:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11059) that's not plausible i mean i i know advocates say 
this you'll hear this on social media and so on    
[3:04:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11063) that a serious scholarship doesn't go 
along with that but serious scholarship    
[3:04:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11067) the individuals who write that will actually 
accept the gay agenda anyway because they are    
[3:04:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11072) modern enlightened western people and part of the 
liberal academy you're not committed to the bible    
[3:04:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11076) they would accept that publicly they would say 
oh no we support all these agendas even though    
[3:04:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11080) the bible correctly understood and historical 
content is actually speaking of these acts    
[3:04:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11084) yes they were prohibited then but today as john 
bob said to me we live in a different world and    
[3:04:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11088) therefore we can accept these acts right that's 
what they argue yeah yeah exactly he's the he uh    
[3:04:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11094) he's british right yes yeah i saw that actually 
and i i remember that um you pushed him on that    
[3:05:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11100) yeah yeah yeah i did because i i've actually i've 
actually got we've got the book here it's just i'm    
[3:05:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11105) going to go into the details now but he he's very 
praising of of a top uh academic work written by    
[3:05:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11111) an american evangelical scholar which 
completely demolishes a revisionist argument    
[3:05:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11115) john how can you agree with this he says 
that's a brilliant scholarship fantastic    
[3:05:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11120) what is your view oh i accept gay marriage how can 
you do that well his understanding of scripture    
[3:05:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11125) is very different from the evangelical scholars 
understanding of scripture it's a human product    
[3:05:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11129) therefore he is free serenely free to ignore it 
in his own modern understanding of human relations    
[3:05:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11136) and you know i mean saying that the quran is a 
human product that's you can't do that islamically    
[3:05:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11141) you absolutely can't do that with 
the quran the grammar yeah even a    
[3:05:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11145) revisionist would never say that because that 
would just take you out of the fold of islam    
[3:05:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11151) in islam it's locked down you can't 
play that game with the holy spirit    
[3:05:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11154) islam otherwise you you you'd be out of the 
fold of islam instantly right the quran being    
[3:05:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11159) the word of god is sort of definitional of 
islam and you know a lot of modern christians    
[3:06:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11164) don't really get that and they kind of say why 
are you guys a lot of christian scholars do that    
[3:06:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11167) they have a very very different understanding 
because the bible is a library of books written    
[3:06:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11170) by many different people and historical critical 
understanding means you can you know you can say    
[3:06:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11175) well this is just a human opinion maybe this is 
revelation it's much more complicated right and    
[3:06:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11179) so what muslim revisionists will do because they 
don't have the option of saying well it's just    
[3:06:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11183) a human text they'll say well of course it's the 
word of god but nevertheless god spoke to people    
[3:06:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11188) you know according to their near eastern context 
and they'll try to historicize i mean of course    
[3:06:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11193) you know we do take historical context 
into consideration it's part of the sharia    
[3:06:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11196) but there are very specific ways of doing 
that you can't just do it like at you know    
[3:06:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11200) you know with no kind of the wobbit or um you 
know parameters and and one of these scholars    
[3:06:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11206) actually who has been pushing you know this 
kind of revisionist line for a long time you    
[3:06:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11210) know you might say well okay if there's one 
thing that muslims could never disagree on    
[3:06:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11214) it must be what tahit like you know the oneness 
of god that's absolutely the most fundamental    
[3:06:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11219) you might say well maybe sexual behavior because 
pretty important but like tahrir is like there's    
[3:07:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11224) no islam without that okay this scholar has been 
pushing this i just saw like a tweet i don't know    
[3:07:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11229) when he put it up but it was just forwarded to me 
a few days ago where he actually said polytheism    
[3:07:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11235) is a derogatory term used by arrogant 
monotheists who don't understand that    
[3:07:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11240) their own conception of god is you know 
influenced by their near eastern you know media    
[3:07:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11246) right and and and they use it to derogate 
other people and uh and anyway these so-called    
[3:07:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11252) polytheists that's why i always say so-called 
polytheism theism and so-called monotheism    
[3:07:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11257) and in any case these uh the spirituality 
of these so-called polytheistic societies    
[3:07:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11262) has a much better track record when it comes 
to diversity and tolerance than the monotheists  
[3:07:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11272) on every level that they are you know so you 
can see that you're going to play that game    
[3:07:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11276) even tahrid itself even tao he does monotheism 
you can just historicize it the same way yeah    
[3:08:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11282) yeah and they're very dangerous i mean it's 
it's but anyway like okay fine at least you    
[3:08:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11287) see clearly like all right no thank you no 
thank you i mean how does that how are you    
[3:08:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11290) even like how do you even identify as muslim 
anymore that doesn't make any sense at all so    
[3:08:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11296) anyway um so sometimes it's good when things 
are stated that directly it allows you to see    
[3:08:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11302) the experts are very clear the passages do 
say what people traditionally answered them    
[3:08:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11305) to me that that that's really beyond dispute now i 
think yeah and so i'll just put here so the um uh    
[3:08:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11311) actually i forgot to hyperlink this 
but it's hyperlinked in the resources    
[3:08:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11314) the the classic you know article on this uh 
is by uh who have you had you've had on twice  
[3:08:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11322) he's an extraordinary individual actually yes 
masha'allah very very impressive hats off we    
[3:08:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11328) all try to follow him i had a coffee with 
him in chicago once i heard about that my    
[3:08:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11333) totally irrelevant boast but i had met him 
we actually sat down for a couple of hours    
[3:08:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11337) and talked shop it was awesome yes he very 
much enjoyed that he told me so can islam    
[3:09:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11342) accommodate homosexual acts potential revisionism 
and the case of scott coogle scott google is this    
[3:09:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11346) person who wrote this book you know um with 
this argument um he's not the author of the    
[3:09:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11352) exactly this is a book by the notorious scott 
coogle uh book which is uh massively criticized    
[3:09:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11359) definitively criticized many would say by mob 
invaders and i mean mobile invites article is is    
[3:09:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11364) even you know um uh is is uh assigned in 
university classrooms right because it's at that    
[3:09:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11370) level um scott coogle was not the author of the 
tweet that i just mentioned where the person was    
[3:09:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11374) i was wondering no it's someone it was another 
academic but not scott google just again you    
[3:09:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11380) know we have to be fair in our criticisms of weak 
critique i'm glad you clarified that because that    
[3:09:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11385) was my assumption the person for what he says not 
not for something either the verse is uncommon    
[3:09:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11390) people want to check them out here they are 
um okay building an islamic framework very    
[3:09:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11395) quickly on homosexuality again one can only 
judge a thing once it is properly conceived  
[3:10:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11402) so we realize the western paradigm is just a 
totally different paradigm it's not you know not    
[3:10:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11407) something that's really compatible so how do we 
as muslims conceive of this as i said there's no    
[3:10:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11412) single word for homosexuality in the shariah right 
again in the west also it's a new word because    
[3:10:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11419) um the sharia addresses what it addresses 
acts not desires i.e desires that are    
[3:10:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11426) things that are beyond one's control okay um 
islam does not categorize human beings on the    
[3:10:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11431) basis of mere desires sexual or other i.e a person 
does not come to does not come to be a particular    
[3:10:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11438) thing or come to constitute a particular class of 
human beings right a discrete on the basis of mere    
[3:10:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11444) desires and inclinations islam also does not place 
human beings into discrete identity categories on    
[3:10:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11450) the basis of acts even if someone has a desire and 
is acting upon them they're still not classified    
[3:10:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11454) as a discrete you know um uh type of human being 
they're just someone who's you know shadow hammer    
[3:11:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11460) this drinker of wine is someone who drinks wine 
if you stop drinking why you're not shattered    
[3:11:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11465) right if you're engaged in same-sex behavior 
okay maybe we'll there's a term that    
[3:11:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11469) describes your behavior if you don't engage 
in it there's no term that applies to you    
[3:11:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11473) just because you might have the 
desire or may have engaged in the end    
[3:11:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11477) question what is the best way to answer the 
question what does islam say about i know the    
[3:11:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11481) answer before you tell us the answer is i have the 
answer watch this video watch this video yeah oh  
[3:11:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11489) that's the answer to that question watch 
this video so what so homosexuality the    
[3:11:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11494) i hope people learn by now what that's a foreign 
term i don't understand what it means you know    
[3:11:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11498) we have to break it apart so what do you mean 
by homosexuality question your terms always    
[3:11:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11503) so we have to distinguish between desires act 
and identity again in islam these are all three    
[3:11:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11508) separate things they have three separate rulings 
three separate considerations three separate    
[3:11:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11512) conversations they're not just wrapped up into one 
what are the implications of accepting a western    
[3:11:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11517) sexual identity framework again we've already 
hit this home on this several times the identity    
[3:12:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11523) framework changes the discussion it elides moral 
concerns puts them completely to the side and it    
[3:12:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11529) frames the issue as one of social justice defined 
subjectively as opposed to one of god's command    
[3:12:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11535) a lost command which is paramount obviously for 
us as muslims and which itself embodies perfect    
[3:12:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11540) justice we cannot be more just than god we cannot 
be more compassionate he is right and when i say    
[3:12:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11546) it change the conversation when i was growing up 
in the 80s it was still common for people to say    
[3:12:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11551) lgbt didn't exist by the way we only homosexuality 
i mean the acronym i think came in the 90s    
[3:12:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11556) and people would say what do you think what do 
you think of homosexuality this was commonly asked    
[3:12:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11560) in the 80s it was understood again the larger you 
know assumptions of the culture it was understood    
[3:12:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11566) that you were asking about the actions and you 
were asking what was your moral opinion of them    
[3:12:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11571) it was understood that the question was asking 
about the morality of the actions and most people    
[3:12:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11575) would have said i think it's wrong that was 
like the normal thing to say in the 80s now    
[3:12:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11579) it's not the word homosexual is not used asking 
where you stand on it is like unacceptable right    
[3:13:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11585) we've replaced it now with lgbtq the reason why i 
say muslims should avoid this term is because it    
[3:13:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11590) is an identity term i mean it is inherently 
an identity term the way it's been used so    
[3:13:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11597) so the only question today and it's not really a 
question because there's only one answer that you    
[3:13:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11601) can have is where do you stand on lgbt rights so 
it went 30 years from what do you think about the    
[3:13:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11608) morality of a particular act to where do you stand 
on the civil rights of a discrete minority forget    
[3:13:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11613) about what the acts might be at all it's just a 
question of do you believe in equality freedom and    
[3:13:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11617) justice or are you a bigot who hates people i mean 
that that's how it's like that's the conversation    
[3:13:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11623) today right and and this is a direct result of 
the identity paradigm you know primarily um so you    
[3:13:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11631) know the last part of this then how can we build 
an islamic framework how does the sharia classify    
[3:13:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11637) sexual acts well there are halal and haram so 
permissible and impermissible that's the basic    
[3:14:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11644) distinction in the sharia what's halal we've 
already seen this a man and a woman bound by    
[3:14:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11648) an islamically valid contract what's haram all 
else we've seen that okay haram acts sexual acts    
[3:14:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11654) are further divided into gross enormities which 
are called quebec plural of kibera we saw quebec    
[3:14:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11660) earlier quebec is the plural so what are the gross 
enormities when it comes to sexual behavior there    
[3:14:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11665) are two one is male female zina which is 
vaginal intercourse between a man and woman    
[3:14:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11670) not married to each other okay or bound by a 
contract um and male male nuat sodomy i mean    
[3:14:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11677) specifically between two males between a man and 
a woman it's also forbidden but it's you know    
[3:14:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11682) it's a different category between two men so 
these two actions zina and liwat fornication    
[3:14:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11687) and sodomy are considered gross enormities um 
and then you have other sexual acts which are    
[3:14:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11694) neither of these two which are actually 
non-penetrative and for that reason they don't    
[3:14:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11698) reach the level of being sort of gross enormities 
although they are also forbidden and so this would    
[3:15:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11703) include all non-penetrative forbidden sexual acts 
between members of the opposite sex members of    
[3:15:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11708) the same sex just the whole gamut including uh 
what's known as sihak which is a specific word    
[3:15:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11714) um and it means grinding so literally female 
sort of genital grinding i.e lesbian acts so    
[3:15:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11721) all of these you know any type of non-penetrative 
uh sexual act between other than a married man and    
[3:15:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11727) woman would be considered prohibited uh in gross 
enormities are penetrated intercourse between a    
[3:15:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11732) man and a woman vaginal and male male penetrative 
intercourse uh the one that burger king    
[3:15:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11738) uh you know is celebrating with the whopper i was 
trying to forget about that you just reminded me    
[3:15:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11743) i'm never gonna be able to go burger king again 
eat a hamburger they're not that i do particularly    
[3:15:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11747) i think yeah anyway well yeah anyway so all of 
these things are called muharram which means    
[3:15:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11753) all these acts are prohibited intrinsically like 
for themselves the acts themselves are prohibited    
[3:15:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11758) right and then there are preludes to these 
prohibited sexual acts such as we've seen this    
[3:16:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11762) before touching gazing khalwa being alone in an 
isolated environment immodest stress speech and    
[3:16:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11767) behavior these are all considered muharram they 
are prohibited on account of another i.e because    
[3:16:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11773) they lead to that which is prohibited in and of 
itself which are the sexual acts themselves right    
[3:16:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11780) okay so that's done the very very 
last part of this and i promise the    
[3:16:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11784) last part of this before we just finish 
with the conclusions and the resources    
[3:16:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11789) what about the subjective experience and i said 
we would talk about this and we've talked about    
[3:16:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11793) it a little bit along the way right someone who is 
a muslim who says i feel same-sex attractions i'm    
[3:16:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11800) not attracted to the other sex i wish i were but 
i'm not and i can't just turn it on and off like a    
[3:16:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11805) light switch how do i live my life does allah hate 
me am i a walking sin am i going to hell for these    
[3:16:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11812) feelings right these are very important questions 
and people who have these feelings particularly    
[3:16:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11816) same sex desire it's all thrown together calmly 
you know the people of louis and fire and    
[3:17:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11821) brimstone rain down upon okay but wait a minute 
they were acting on it you're not acting again    
[3:17:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11826) you're putting yourself with them because you're 
not distinguishing acts from behavior because    
[3:17:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11831) that's part of the modern paradigm you are seeing 
them all together but that's not islam islam sees    
[3:17:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11837) the desires one thing the acts or another right 
so there are muslims faithful muslims believing    
[3:17:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11843) muslims practicing muslims who experience 
unchosen same-sex attractions and or gender    
[3:17:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11848) dysphoria this is real this is statistically any 
you know certain uh human population will have    
[3:17:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11854) always a number of people who face these 
types of issues and and muslims you know    
[3:17:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11859) are naive if they think this doesn't exist 
in the muslim community it absolutely does    
[3:17:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11863) much more than people actually would think because 
it's obviously not talked about right but this is    
[3:17:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11868) a very real issue all sorts of issues muslims are 
human beings like others we have anger issues drug    
[3:17:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11875) addiction issues we have issues of corruption and 
cheating and this and that and all human versus    
[3:18:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11881) virtues and vices to one degree or another 
are going to be present in any human community    
[3:18:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11885) we hope among muslims they the virtues 
would be greater and the vice is less    
[3:18:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11889) than people who don't practice the religion 
of islam and that's generally the case    
[3:18:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11892) but nevertheless we will always find and this is 
not virtual advice it's just internal conditions    
[3:18:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11898) we said again very important and i'm 
speaking obviously people watching this    
[3:18:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11902) some people watching this will be muslims who 
are watching this because they themselves fall    
[3:18:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11906) in this category and they are concerned how 
can i you know understand myself what do i do    
[3:18:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11911) with my religion what do i do with my sexuality 
right islam does not define or categorize people    
[3:18:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11916) on the basis of internal feelings you are not a 
specific sub-category of muslim you are a muslim    
[3:18:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11921) like anyone else a brother a sister a member of 
your masjid right there you are not this specific    
[3:18:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11928) kind of separate category of human being because 
you feel this particular thing right and again we    
[3:18:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11935) must always distinguish between the feelings and 
the acts on one hand and also between the acts and    
[3:19:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11940) advocacy on the other which we're starting 
to see unfortunately more and more of okay    
[3:19:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11944) muslims struggling faithfully and this is also for 
the everyone who's listening especially muslims    
[3:19:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11950) who maybe are not dealing with this muslims 
struggling faithfully with either ssas or same-sex    
[3:19:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11955) attractions or gid gender identities disorder 
or dysphoria they should be i said struggling    
[3:19:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11962) faithfully faithfully should be embraced and 
supported as mujahidun in the path of allah    
[3:19:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11967) these are people struggling in the way of allah 
they're struggling with challenges and temptations    
[3:19:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11972) like we all have our challenges and temptations 
and they are trying to live their lives according    
[3:19:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11976) to the will of god and to submit which is every 
muslim struggle and that is the straight struggle    
[3:19:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11983) guide us to the straight path every muslim is is 
trying to go the straight path no pi no the pun is    
[3:19:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11989) intended here and there is a support group called 
straight struggle you can just click on this    
[3:19:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=11994) hyperlink and it is a support group for muslims 
who experience same-sex attractions or gender    
[3:20:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12000) dysphoria but who are committed to islam into 
living their lives it's a very good group i do    
[3:20:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12004) i do recommend it right and so they are coming 
together to support themselves and and share    
[3:20:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12010) resources and so on and so forth and there's also 
a group based in the uk strong support brother ali    
[3:20:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12016) al jaffari this started about two years ago two 
or three years ago so you have these two support    
[3:20:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12021) groups right now muslims again who don't deal with 
this should be aware these feelings cannot simply    
[3:20:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12027) be turned on and off like a switch well i feel 
that's disgusting well you know like allah gave    
[3:20:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12032) you women well okay yes that's right but this 
goes much deeper than that it's not simplistic    
[3:20:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12038) in that way and people again we can't afford to 
have such a simplistic uh you know understanding    
[3:20:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12044) especially given our current contacts if you speak 
that way people say okay this person has no idea    
[3:20:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12049) what this is even about right and and therefore 
anything you say on the issue is just gonna sound    
[3:20:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12054) you know ridiculous to many people including many 
sincere muslims by the way right again the gay    
[3:20:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12059) identity paradigm is very very uh you know this 
is a very critical thing that you know this the    
[3:21:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12065) identity paradigm is a big trap it is a trap for 
the community because it again it it it completely    
[3:21:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12073) up ends the moral discourse of the sharian it up 
ends the moral discourse because now the sharia is    
[3:21:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12079) is excluding people's core identities and 
undermining their dignity this makes mince    
[3:21:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12084) meat of the shariah also this can be a trap for 
the person him or herself right you're born in the    
[3:21:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12090) modern world okay well this is who i am we islam 
would say this is not who you are you're a muslim    
[3:21:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12095) you're a servant of god you're a creature of god 
you're the you don't have to identify with your    
[3:21:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12101) sexual drives even if you have exclusive same-sex 
desires okay that's something about you something    
[3:21:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12106) you have is not that doesn't define who you are 
at your core right again that's i hope you can    
[3:21:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12112) see now this is a modern social construct of 
the contemporary west this is not universal    
[3:21:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12118) it is not islamic yesterday or today this does 
not exist in other times and places you won't find    
[3:22:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12123) corresponding vocabulary in most other languages 
in the world you know today or in the past if it's    
[3:22:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12129) today only because they're translating from 
western languages because again the dominance    
[3:22:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12132) of the western paradigm right but in it but 
if you are someone who has grown up in the    
[3:22:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12138) west then you have no other language except oh 
my gosh i feel this i'm gay this is who i am    
[3:22:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12145) you have no other language to process it because 
that's the only language that's available to you    
[3:22:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12150) in the cultural sphere and and this talk hopefully 
has has you know helped you to see that wait a    
[3:22:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12156) minute that's a very contingent and specific way 
of construing this experience right and it can    
[3:22:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12162) be construed otherwise and these desires can be 
shuffled around and they can be given a different    
[3:22:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12168) meaning in my life and they don't have to form 
the core of my identity and you know uh and it    
[3:22:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12174) could in fact be very liberating not to have to 
carry around this burden that okay this is kind    
[3:23:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12180) of who i am at my core right especially when you 
know it conflicts with acting on it conflicts with    
[3:23:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12184) the religion this is puts you in a very difficult 
situation but you you know that identification    
[3:23:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12190) don't take it for granted right now other muslims 
who are hearing this don't say if someone comes    
[3:23:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12195) to you with it oh well don't identify it okay 
easier said than done went for 20 30 years or    
[3:23:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12200) whatever 15 years all you've been you've grown up 
in this kind of identity paradigm and if this has    
[3:23:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12206) been your struggle and you've come to like see 
yourself as a quote unquote gay person right    
[3:23:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12211) it's not just by hearing one talk or reading one 
article that you're gonna just undo all of that    
[3:23:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12215) oh okay tomorrow i don't identify anymore i have 
these desires but they're just desires and not who    
[3:23:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12219) i am and all okay this takes time this takes you 
know really a lot of thinking and redoing one's    
[3:23:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12226) emotional and you know internal rearranging ones 
furniture and all of that don't expect someone to    
[3:23:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12231) just like kind of uh you know oh well dr shadif 
said this was just western contingent whatever    
[3:23:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12237) so you know yeah well it's true but again we're 
all products of our time and place and we have    
[3:24:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12242) to look at this realistically right i've mentioned 
before and we're coming to this now this is going    
[3:24:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12246) to be the end we have a wealth of resources in 
our community to help faithful strugglers on this    
[3:24:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12252) path right um a beautiful article that i think 
all muslims should read especially in the west    
[3:24:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12257) whether they deal with this issue personally or 
not it's called from a same-sex attracted muslim    
[3:24:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12262) between denial of reality and distortion of 
religion beautiful piece written by brother    
[3:24:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12266) youssef who has been the um yes i think it's 
been published in there as well yes it is it's uh    
[3:24:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12272) sex matters love marriage and the sinner um that 
that is isn't it this book is also i do recommend    
[3:24:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12278) this generally for uh general discussions of sex 
in the islamic tradition um and of course paul    
[3:24:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12284) has it right at his finger pit tips right every 
relevant book you know truman and every everything    
[3:24:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12289) i've mentioned where's your where's your 
mcintyre i didn't see it afterwards you of course  
[3:25:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12302) moderator of the straight struggle support group 
for like 20 years yeah and he wrote this very    
[3:25:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12308) beautiful article and then a game changer in 
my opinion is a way beyond the rainbow podcast    
[3:25:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12313) brother jensen 88 episodes 88 episodes deals 
with this topic from every possible conceivable    
[3:25:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12321) angle that you can think of um psychological you 
know spiritual social personal family community    
[3:25:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12329) imams i mean same-sex attraction gender dysphoria 
marriage i mean everything 88 episodes um and and    
[3:25:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12337) i'll show you a little bit more of the details in 
a second on that right um some questions we won't    
[3:25:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12342) be able to deal with these distinguishing being 
gay so that's the identity paradigm from having    
[3:25:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12347) same-sex attractions we've talked about this 
where does homosexuality or same-sex attractions    
[3:25:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12352) come from i refer you to episodes seven and 
eight of the podcast uh way beyond the rainbow    
[3:25:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12357) um the brother goes into a great detail all of 
the research that's been done on this what it says    
[3:26:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12362) and what it doesn't say so i won't repeat any of 
that here um can homosexual homosexuality be quote    
[3:26:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12368) unquote cured or overcome again very murky and 
fraught question that cannot be answered you know    
[3:26:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12375) overcome it depends what one means by that cured 
i mean again uh you can find answers to that in    
[3:26:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12380) that podcast can someone with same-sex attractions 
ever hope to marry islamically i.e to an opposite    
[3:26:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12386) part sex part and have a family some perhaps some 
perhaps not again you know this is a big question    
[3:26:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12392) and there are several episodes dedicated to this 
in the podcast so i really appreciate it just on    
[3:26:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12396) that i know it's coming to the end but i'll just 
on that quite on the very question um it's quite    
[3:26:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12400) interesting i was i once read um an article by a 
uh a quite a respecting gay journalist actually he    
[3:26:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12407) said it's the big it's the big secret of the gay 
community um is that most gay men can actually    
[3:26:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12414) function heterosexually and um because it's it's 
relatively uncommon to have people who are 100    
[3:27:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12422) gay there's always you know most gay men can 
if they wished function heterosexually and    
[3:27:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12428) of course if the most famous example would 
be oscar wilde you actually had a family he    
[3:27:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12432) was married and had children he could function 
heterosexually although he was gay uh so people    
[3:27:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12438) forget that and think well if i'm if a person is 
gay that is their whole identity and their whole    
[3:27:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12443) possible expression of sexuality is usually not 
actually um and i i there are people who i know    
[3:27:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12450) who who identify as gay but i know that they are 
they have a heterosexual component because they    
[3:27:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12456) told me they do but they don't identify that 
way so this is very very true um it's quite    
[3:27:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12460) so in a different age many of these people would 
have married perhaps and had children uh but in    
[3:27:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12466) today's age they don't because they don't have 
to that pressure they would have married had    
[3:27:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12470) children maybe had these desires if they were 
they would have had they could function as    
[3:27:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12477) but it was not who they were you know um but today 
you're told if you feel like one drop of like you    
[3:28:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12483) know you're attracted to someone okay well then 
you're just a closet homosexual and that's who you    
[3:28:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12486) are and you're denying yourself you're bisexual 
and you must express both you know the whole    
[3:28:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12491) thing has been configured very differently then it 
didn't have to be this way but as you repeatedly    
[3:28:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12495) says it's a very historically contingent and 
recent development in just one part of the world    
[3:28:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12500) the west which because of its geopolitical 
power now is hegemonic over the planet but    
[3:28:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12505) it wasn't always that way five minutes ago in 
historical time it wasn't it was very different    
[3:28:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12511) absolutely yep and again that goes back 
again the identity paradigm is absolutely    
[3:28:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12516) key to all of this i mean it's it really explains 
you know every everything that we that we see um    
[3:28:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12522) how best to deal with individuals who experience 
ssa in our communities families etc again all of    
[3:28:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12527) this is you know very um uh dealt with in great 
detail in the podcast especially season five    
[3:28:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12532) season five brother moving vayad is on for i 
think four different episodes um imam is on    
[3:28:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12539) sheikh mustafar who's done great work on on 
this on this issue and has researched a lot into    
[3:29:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12545) uh same sex attraction gender just for you 
spoken very eloquently um so a lot of you    
[3:29:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12549) know the sort of well-known scholars in the 
west um and thinkers um are actually you know    
[3:29:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12555) share their experiences on this so again i won't 
repeat here because we we don't have time and    
[3:29:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12560) again you know i can refer you to the podcast how 
best to deal with non-muslim colleagues classmates    
[3:29:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12565) etc when it comes to this issue again i think 
the episodes particularly the shaykh mustafa omar    
[3:29:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12569) really goes into the details and also you 
know people ask well what about pronouns at    
[3:29:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12573) work and i have to you know he goes into 
all of this mustafa if you go to the the    
[3:29:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12578) um uh episodes that he does how should muslims 
deal with the cultural and political pressures    
[3:29:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12583) stemming from this issue in the public square 
particularly in the west um i refer you again to    
[3:29:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12588) brother morbine viad's a recent article from this 
january where the rainbow ends american muslims    
[3:29:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12595) came on blogging theology to discuss that article 
yes so you can see a video or read the article    
[3:30:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12600) exactly or both right okay now we're just wrap 
wrapping up alhamdulillah we're almost at the at    
[3:30:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12607) the end um so towards principles i have two slides 
here and this is basically just a wrap up you know    
[3:30:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12613) the take-home message from the from the entire 
evening or morning or wherever you are in the    
[3:30:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12617) world um so what do we need to do as a community 
if we want to i think um deal with this issue    
[3:30:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12623) effectively in a just compassionate and incorrect 
way we need to strongly and confidently establish    
[3:30:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12630) our islamic gender and sexuality paradigm is very 
different from the contemporary western one we    
[3:30:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12635) believe in gender essentialism we believe in the 
gender binary we're heteronormative it means all    
[3:30:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12640) of these terrible words that you've been told are 
like from the devil you know we deconstruct that    
[3:30:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12645) all that is that's all concocted vocabulary right 
and and we go to the mahani we go to the meanings    
[3:30:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12650) and we look at the wisdom of the legislation of 
our creator and we understand it and we establish    
[3:30:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12656) it uh you know the gender and sexually paradigm 
right so again gender is binary gender differences    
[3:31:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12662) are real and god-given again these are just 
take-home messenger messages sexual expression is    
[3:31:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12667) legitimate only in the context of marriage which 
is by definition heterosexual um act we should    
[3:31:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12673) also critique and deconstruct as we've tried to 
do paul and i uh in this uh podcast we should    
[3:31:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12679) actively critique and deconstruct west the western 
paradigm post-sexual revolution and show what is    
[3:31:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12686) wrong with it because it's harmful to people it 
har it's not just because muslims don't like it    
[3:31:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12691) it harms people right it leads people to 
destructive behaviors it leads them to sexual    
[3:31:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12695) chaos and not just in the realm of homosexuality i 
mean you know just even heterosexual sex is a mess    
[3:31:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12700) in the west today marriage is a mess partnering is 
a mess the sexual marketplace is a disaster i mean    
[3:31:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12705) there's the the the the uh repercussions 
and the fallout of the sexual revolution    
[3:31:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12711) no one wants to talk about it because it 
would strike at their core ideological    
[3:31:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12715) and moral commitments we still have people who 
are drinking the milk of the sexual revolution    
[3:32:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12720) who are adults today and they're not willing 
to you know to fundamentally question their    
[3:32:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12725) basic assumptions that they've taught made 
them enlightened modern people uh you know    
[3:32:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12730) uh post 60s and and we're going to continue to 
pay the price as long as that's the case i'm    
[3:32:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12735) sorry paul you recognized no i interrupted 
you no i was going to say there's also the    
[3:32:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12739) geopolitical uh position here that the uh before 
there was western colonialism it was perhaps    
[3:32:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12745) economic and then it was political then it was 
military military but today western colonialism    
[3:32:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12751) in my view is heavily ideological they can have 
the other things as well of course but it has a    
[3:32:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12756) new virulent form of ideological colonization 
where you you mentioned the tweets where the    
[3:32:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12761) american government is right uh the muslim world 
which is considered highly provocative of course    
[3:32:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12767) by that by by many muslim world and this this is 
a new form of colonialism which which is this lgbt    
[3:32:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12773) colonialism which is non-negotiable so the rest of 
the world must convert submit obey unconditionally    
[3:33:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12780) to the latest uh western colonial uh project which 
has been which is changing all the time by the way    
[3:33:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12787) this is why it's so tiresome isn't it it's always 
it's always changing you know how much more    
[3:33:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12792) because islam as a repeatable you say is based 
on the stability of god's revelation to humankind    
[3:33:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12798) and he's not constantly having to reinvent itself 
um so it's a sure anchor or a rope as you put it    
[3:33:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12804) earlier on for people to hold on to um but this 
is i think a manifestation of neocolonialism where    
[3:33:30](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12810) the wrestling is expected to come into line with 
western interests and ideas and ideologies as a    
[3:33:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12816) matter of principle because the west knows 
best it always has and always will do that    
[3:33:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12822) which is a huge arrogance and a form of 
imperialism itself of course yep i agree with    
[3:33:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12827) you 100 and ironically it's a lot of these kind 
of you know people within the academy or some of    
[3:33:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12833) these sort of more left-leaning spaces who talk 
the talk of colonialism and neo colonialism and    
[3:33:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12839) post-colonialism but they're also very heavily 
invested in kind of pushing this particular    
[3:34:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12843) narrative and it's like isn't it obvious to 
you that this is just you know you talk about    
[3:34:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12848) victorian morality being brought into the muslim 
world by british colonials in the 19th century    
[3:34:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12852) okay yes that's true but you're doing the 
same thing now in the 21st century exactly    
[3:34:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12856) the same thing because these ideologies 
were born in in britain and america and    
[3:34:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12860) germany and france absolutely exactly the same 
place and is the the movement of influence and    
[3:34:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12866) power and close exactly the same movement from 
one place to another it's all the same thing    
[3:34:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12871) but it's just a different guys a different 
different dress yeah absolutely um okay so    
[3:34:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12879) uh rejection so we talked about this a lot 
again take home message rejection of the sexual    
[3:34:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12883) identity paradigm uh we must once again separate 
desire from action from identity these are three    
[3:34:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12889) separate things just like race gender and sexual 
behavior those are three separate things right    
[3:34:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12895) desire action and identity separate we have to 
separate these and we also have to bring back    
[3:34:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12899) together sex reproduction marriage morality put 
those together okay terminological terminological    
[3:35:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12904) implications we should avoid identity laden 
vocabulary like gay lgbt right these are heavily    
[3:35:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12911) uh identity-laden terms or dignifying 
quote-unquote who people are well who are people    
[3:35:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12917) right they're not their sexuality especially 
as a muslim we dignify people as muslims    
[3:35:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12921) right so all this language about you know 
dignifying who people are right get uh you    
[3:35:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12927) know and using sort of identity identity you 
know vocabulary that's laden with identity    
[3:35:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12933) um implications uh especially you know again when 
we deal with the outside society you should try to    
[3:35:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12938) be careful of your vocabulary you use but you have 
to negotiate but inside the muslim community these    
[3:35:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12943) are not terms that we should be using which is 
why at the top beginning of this talk i put lgbtq    
[3:35:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12947) in quotation marks because it's not a term that 
i as a muslim speaker and you know in in in    
[3:35:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12953) using with an audience you know um whether 
muslim audience probably majority muslim but also    
[3:35:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12959) non-muslim audience right it's it's a term that 
i think needs to be problematized right and so    
[3:36:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12964) that's why i put it in in quotes right we should 
use descriptive terms instead in adjectives not    
[3:36:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12969) now so someone has homosexual feelings experiences 
same-sex desires very different from saying they    
[3:36:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12975) are gay and even the medical field they say so 
and so you know has what do you say has diabetes    
[3:36:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12980) they stopped saying so-and-so is a diabetic 
i mean they've shifted in medical right    
[3:36:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12986) yeah they shifted because you are a diabetic i'm 
i'm defining you according to your illness no you    
[3:36:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=12992) are a x person and you have diabetes but you're 
not a diabetic right so we should also be you know    
[3:36:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13001) sensitive to that language use i say no gay 
exceptionalism either positive or negative what    
[3:36:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13006) do i mean by this so pushing acceptance of lgbt 
acts acts in an islamic environment in an islamic    
[3:36:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13014) environment like schools mosques communities 
and so forth is just as unacceptable as pushing    
[3:36:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13019) alcohol zina or anything else that's forbidden 
by the religion there's no exception here because    
[3:37:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13024) again we're not tying this to identity only 
when you tie it to identity do you have to see    
[3:37:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13028) you know that uh right and you see this also 
in the current society for example i was at a    
[3:37:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13033) university once and they're the gay pride student 
group they were having a dance right and the    
[3:37:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13039) advertisement for the dance the poster was you 
know come to this pride dance whatever saturday    
[3:37:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13044) and the picture on it was a drawing it wasn't like 
a photograph it was like art deco figures like    
[3:37:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13048) two men completely naked dancing and the picture 
showed everything right down to like you know the    
[3:37:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13055) very bottom of the groin as far as you could go 
possibly you know without showing like the organ    
[3:37:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13060) so i mean clearly the people are meant to be shown 
like dancing naked and i think if that were just    
[3:37:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13066) any other student group like the latino club or 
the you know whatever or the dance club and they    
[3:37:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13072) showed like a man and a woman dancing who were 
like naked on the poster you'd be like what like    
[3:37:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13078) what kind of dance is this like why are they 
why are the people naked on the poster right    
[3:38:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13083) they wouldn't be considered acceptable but if 
it's a pride parade or like an lgbt dance oh    
[3:38:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13088) well that's perfectly like you know there's like 
an exceptionalism here that okay yeah you can have    
[3:38:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13093) very provocative or kind of images that would 
otherwise be considered lewd and inappropriate but    
[3:38:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13098) because you know you're basically defining 
your identity by this well we're not going    
[3:38:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13102) to say anything and so there's kind of an 
exceptionalism so we should not accept that    
[3:38:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13106) as muslims right we have a moral standard and 
we stick to that at the same time so there's no    
[3:38:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13111) like positive gay exceptionalism but also not 
negative so again and i say this to muslims of    
[3:38:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13116) probably a more traditional bent or people who 
they consider themselves like okay well we're    
[3:38:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13120) firm and hardcore on this issue be careful 
right as i said before you might be more    
[3:38:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13126) uh more impacted by the modern western 
paradigm than you yourself imagine    
[3:38:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13132) merely having and faithfully struggling with 
same-sex desires or you know gender identity    
[3:38:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13138) issues also does not merit any particular 
stigma or singling out someone comes to you    
[3:39:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13144) your friend i've known you for so long i have this 
big thing i want to you know share with you it's    
[3:39:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13148) so difficult for me you know oh that's go away 
uh no this person's coming they made themselves    
[3:39:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13154) very vulnerable you help them you embrace 
them you support them right and you don't    
[3:39:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13158) specifically stigmatize them for something that 
they don't you know did not bring upon themselves    
[3:39:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13164) and are not morally responsible for right we're 
not talking about people who are pushing the    
[3:39:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13168) actions or advocating we're talking about someone 
who feels a desire and is struggling with it right    
[3:39:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13173) we don't have a particular you know sort of 
uh particular stigma or singling out for this    
[3:39:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13179) or say oh that's the gay brother whatever no gay 
brother okay now you're a western modern western    
[3:39:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13184) don't tell me you're traditional muslim and you 
say gay muslim well what do you mean say that and    
[3:39:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13188) say tell me that in classical arabic i don't have 
a word for it i don't have a word for gay i don't    
[3:39:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13193) there's no word that covers you know identifying a 
person based on sexual feelings this doesn't exist    
[3:40:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13200) i can only name people are doing things or gender 
male females so forth okay all right balancing    
[3:40:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13206) individual and community subjective feelings 
versus objective truths we talked about this you    
[3:40:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13210) know the objective right and wrong the objective 
nature of acts and how laws define them and    
[3:40:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13216) legislate according to him and the subjective 
feelings of people who are facing these desires    
[3:40:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13220) right so as i said before individuals dealing 
with same-sex attraction or gender identity issues    
[3:40:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13225) should be supported in their efforts to realize 
their purpose as muslims and live their lives in    
[3:40:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13229) submission to allah and his deen again go back 
to that you know article by brother youssef    
[3:40:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13234) you know from the same sex attracted 
muslim between distorting reality and  
[3:40:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13242) denying reality and distorting religion okay so 
we should have private support and consultation    
[3:40:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13246) to people who deal with these issues right someone 
comes to you they should be able to go to an imam    
[3:40:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13251) to their parents to trusted individuals right 
like with any other problem they might have    
[3:40:55](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13255) and need support they should be able to find it 
within supportive and compassionate and loving    
[3:41:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13260) communities right but this is private like if 
i have a drinking issue or anything else right    
[3:41:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13264) i'm going to go and speak about it private i'm not 
just going to come in and wear it on my shirt and    
[3:41:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13268) and sort of set up a table at the mosque that's a 
very different thing right so private support and    
[3:41:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13273) consultation people should have people within the 
community to turn to right as opposed to public    
[3:41:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13279) quote-unquote accommodation or inclusion again i 
put these in quotes because these are buzzwords    
[3:41:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13284) accommodation inclusion right they sound very nice 
but they mean something very specific which is not    
[3:41:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13289) acceptable uh given our moral framework 
as muslims right defiant activist types    
[3:41:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13294) within the community should not be allowed to 
disrupt islamic spaces or impose their will on    
[3:41:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13299) the community again no exceptionalism here you 
want to come to the reed celebration and set up    
[3:41:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13304) an uh wine table you're not that's not going to 
be tolerated you drink on your own time that's    
[3:41:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13308) your own business you don't come and push it on 
the community no exceptionalism when it comes to    
[3:41:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13313) sexual behavior that is prohibited by the religion 
supporting the faithful struggler we've done this    
[3:41:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13318) show empathy and understanding for what is often 
a very difficult and emotionally taxing issue    
[3:42:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13322) support the person in general spiritual in other 
ways mentorship general advice listening ear    
[3:42:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13328) shoulder to cry on right but also again someone 
comes to you privately know your limits you are    
[3:42:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13333) not a spiritual guide you're not a professional 
psychologist it's a deep issue and you don't know    
[3:42:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13337) the details of it so what direct them to resources 
such as all the resources we have in our community    
[3:42:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13342) such as a way beyond the rainbow podcasts 
and these other resources and maybe offered    
[3:42:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13346) to discuss but know your pay grade as paul 
said earlier don't go beyond your pay grab    
[3:42:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13351) and then finally maintaining the straight 
path clarity compassion conviction three    
[3:42:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13355) c's you know we've come up with this in 
some other groups right you are not more    
[3:42:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13359) merciful than allah right so people say we 
need to be compassionate of course we do    
[3:42:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13363) and we are compassion true compassion is guiding 
to the truth and what pleases a creator this is    
[3:42:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13369) what is going to be best for people in this 
world and in the next this is true compassion    
[3:42:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13373) compassion is not to usurp the place of god over 
rule his legislation because you know better    
[3:42:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13379) right this is something that people who 
you know they come with this argument from    
[3:43:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13383) compassion and justice you're not more 
compassionate in justice than just in allah he is  
[3:43:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13390) and none of us can claim those titles for 
ourselves be humble and kind but never    
[3:43:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13395) apologetic about islamic beliefs right we're not 
apologetic islam is clear it's from the creator    
[3:43:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13400) it's the birthright of every human being to 
know about it to be told and to be invited to it    
[3:43:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13404) and allah guides whom he wills it's not in our 
hands right islamic teachings very important    
[3:43:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13408) take home message and this is the last one 
islamic teachings on sexual ethics are not an    
[3:43:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13413) embarrassment or a problem listen youth in the 
west right islamic teachings on sexual ethics    
[3:43:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13420) and gender and sexuality in the whole gamut 
are not an embarrassment or problem they are    
[3:43:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13424) the only solution to our problems they 
are the solution that the west itself    
[3:43:49](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13429) desperately needs and we all desperately 
need and it is for us to realize that and    
[3:43:53](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13433) take it on and articulate it in the best and 
most beautiful way as we read them opponents  
[3:44:06](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13446) and beautiful exhortation and dispute with 
them in the best possible way right this is    
[3:44:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13452) the command that we have been uh given and on 
on this i will just resources we have actually    
[3:44:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13457) seen them from the same sex attracted muslim uh 
between denial of reality and distortion religion    
[3:44:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13462) brother yusuf please i think everyone should 
read that it's not very long beautifully written    
[3:44:26](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13466) way beyond the rainbow podcast i'll show you 
some details on it uh in the very last slide    
[3:44:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13471) uh we've seen brother mcbean's piece 
candace slam accommodate homosexual acts    
[3:44:34](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13474) quranic revisionism in the case of scott cool well 
this is a masterly scholar a masterly scholarly    
[3:44:40](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13480) study i mean really hats off it's it's really 
extremely well done and you will learn so much    
[3:44:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13486) about islam and about categories and about the 
contingency about sexual categories even if you're    
[3:44:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13491) not particularly interested in this article it's 
a very uh informative and educational read so i    
[3:44:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13498) actually like i think muslims should challenge 
themselves it's like 50 pages it's not short    
[3:45:02](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13502) but it's really worth your time you'll gain a lot 
until actually i agree with every i agree with    
[3:45:07](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13507) your assessment there absolutely yeah absolutely 
and the male is not like the female from the quran    
[3:45:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13513) so we saw that islam and gender non-conformity 
also again brother will be invited    
[3:45:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13518) right he's almost single-handedly carrying this 
you know has been carrying this burden for the    
[3:45:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13521) past you know five six years may allah bless 
him um muslim matters 2017. that was part one    
[3:45:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13527) part two was co-authored between brother mubi 
invade and brother johnson of the away beyond    
[3:45:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13533) the rainbow podcast this is the 85-page study 
based on 150 or 60 sources right it's a massive    
[3:45:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13541) massive study on transgenderism the history 
of it the contemporary scene in the west    
[3:45:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13547) also muslim rulings on it okay so anything you 
want to do about transgenderism these two articles    
[3:45:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13551) are key foundational articles on gender the family 
and sexuality by sheikhan one of our treasures in    
[3:45:58](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13558) the west has also been a guest on this podcast 
before um three of his articles they're mostly    
[3:46:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13564) quite old boys will be boys gender identity issues 
islam irrigate and the retrieval of gender fall    
[3:46:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13569) of the family all of them very very insightful 
very incredibly eloquent as we know from jihad    
[3:46:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13576) always very insightful and extremely eloquent 
so these i think are again somewhat dated but    
[3:46:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13581) they're still relevant and i think foundational 
for any muslim in inter intra-muslim discussion on    
[3:46:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13588) gender and sexuality issues in general and 
homosexuality of course in particular and then    
[3:46:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13593) this last resource islam and lgbt issues reading 
material muhammadan discourse.blogspot.com tons of    
[3:46:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13599) all of these resources and a lot more are on this 
particular website and then finally a just uh you    
[3:46:46](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13606) know because i've said uh talked about this away 
beyond the rainbow i think it is a game changer    
[3:46:51](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13611) um it is very easy to critique a religious 
community by saying you're stuck in the middle    
[3:46:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13616) ages you're stuck in your books you have no idea 
what's going on or you're all just heteronormative    
[3:47:00](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13620) and you don't understand our position i.e we 
who you know experience same-sex attractions    
[3:47:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13625) this is cannot be the case here right this 
brother is coming from that inside perspective    
[3:47:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13630) he is a doctor and a medical researcher he 
knows what he's doing it's extremely well    
[3:47:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13635) uh extremely well researched extremely well 
documented and very interesting and a lot of    
[3:47:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13641) also guests and things like that so a way beyond 
the rainbow is a podcast series this is the    
[3:47:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13647) you know kind of tagline discussing the everyday 
struggles of muslims with same-sex attractions    
[3:47:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13652) ssa and gender dysphoria who want to live a life 
true to allah in islam this podcast series is    
[3:47:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13658) a safe space for muslims who struggle with ssa 
as well as parents family members friends imams    
[3:47:43](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13663) chaplains community leaders in the community at 
large it is separated into five seasons season    
[3:47:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13668) one tackles topics to give you an idea shame 
vulnerability self-compassion identity so on and    
[3:47:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13674) so forth okay i won't read everything because it's 
it's season two tackles the spiritual dimensions    
[3:47:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13679) related to this particular struggle right how 
can people understand the spiritual dimensions    
[3:48:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13683) of this particular struggle every struggle but 
this particular one from the wisdom of hardships    
[3:48:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13688) and tribulations attachments and surrender 
as well as gifts and divine openings future    
[3:48:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13695) to the struggle with temptations and desires sin 
and repentance as well as the story of the people    
[3:48:19](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13699) of loot and of many of the other prophets whose 
stories are relevant to every struggle including    
[3:48:23](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13703) this particular struggle season three focuses 
on the importance of support systems and social    
[3:48:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13708) connections and answers frequently asked questions 
when it comes to friendships and support groups    
[3:48:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13713) the season also tackles in depth topics 
of marriage and celibacy i.e for people    
[3:48:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13717) who experience same-sex attractions as well as 
marital intimacy and sex right so again it's    
[3:48:42](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13722) completely comprehensive season four dedicated 
to healing and recovery work tackles foundational    
[3:48:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13727) topics relevant to the healing journey and this 
is actually relevant to people who don't even    
[3:48:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13732) experience same-sex attractions just general you 
know complex trauma he takes a lot from the sort    
[3:48:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13737) of conservatory psychological perspectives 
but from you know islamic uh angle emotional    
[3:49:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13743) attachments dependence in codependency um and 
then you know sexual compulsions and addictions    
[3:49:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13748) as well as sexual abuse so these are things are 
unfortunately relevant to a lot of muslims you    
[3:49:13](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13753) know have experienced sexual abuse whether they 
experience you know same-sex attractions or not    
[3:49:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13757) uh sexual compulsions and addictions there 
are i think four episodes on masturbation    
[3:49:22](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13762) pornography addictions and again unfortunately 
given the state of current technology and so    
[3:49:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13767) forth many many muslims i mean we're not we are 
not immune to these struggles and many muslims    
[3:49:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13773) quite apart from same-sex attraction deal with 
you know issues of sexual compulsion issues of    
[3:49:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13779) pornography addiction and so forth um and and 
so you can also find very uh beneficial things    
[3:49:45](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13785) here and then the last season addresses the wider 
community and focuses on relevant sociopolitical    
[3:49:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13792) themes such as revisionist movements so again 
you know brother mubin does the whole takedown    
[3:49:57](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13797) of the revisionist you know uh arguments based 
on his work uh shutting our perspectives gender    
[3:50:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13804) dysphoria and transgenderism and also topics that 
are relevant for parents and family members i.e    
[3:50:09](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13809) muslims who have same-sex attraction or gender 
identity issues for spouses teachers imams and    
[3:50:15](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13815) community leaders so completely comprehensive 
and again a lot of muslim kind of personalities    
[3:50:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13821) have come there are also personal stories personal 
stories scattered throughout the podcast a sister    
[3:50:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13827) a muslim sister who uh left a same-sex marriage to 
come back to allah subhanahu ta'ala you know and    
[3:50:33](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13833) other such stories that are very interesting 
and not really what you hear every day    
[3:50:37](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13837) in the kind of barrage of kind of pro-lgbt 
messaging that we are subjected to so  
[3:50:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13848) and i thank everyone for your time and attention 
i think brother paul especially everyone else can    
[3:50:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13854) stop and start but you've been sitting here for 
i think what's coming up on four hours now and    
[3:50:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13859) i know you've been and traveling imagine this 
must be the absolute longest episode you've had    
[3:51:04](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13864) oh this is a record this is a record breaker 
i'm very sorry to go on and on and on i think    
[3:51:11](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13871) it's an important topic i hope we've i agree well 
before before we went before we recorded this we    
[3:51:16](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13876) discussed whether or not we should cut it up 
into pieces and stuff and we decided no it's    
[3:51:20](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13880) best to keep it in as the unity and the integrity 
of one episode and even it is very long i think    
[3:51:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13887) there's value in that and hopefully we will have 
time stamps underneath it as well as well as the    
[3:51:31](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13891) slides which will be accessible um so it won't 
necessarily have to be digested in one large go    
[3:51:38](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13898) right okay well thank you very very much paul 
you're doing excellent work i mean blogging    
[3:51:44](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13904) theology is an amazing resource um for people are 
just new to blogging theology i really strongly    
[3:51:50](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13910) encourage you to check out i mean paul is indeed 
fatigable it's unbelievable that literally almost    
[3:51:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13916) every single day i think you know he has a new 
episode out and uh very often uh he's discussing    
[3:52:03](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13923) deep works with authors that require him to have 
read these works you know i mean it's not just    
[3:52:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13928) like it's not easy it's not easy he invited me 
to talk i've been you know running my mouth for    
[3:52:12](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13932) four hours but like ver usually i mean he had me 
on before he read my book and other people and    
[3:52:17](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13937) as you've seen every time someone mentions 
a book i don't know how you do it he just    
[3:52:21](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13941) doesn't even get up from his chair reaches 
oh here's the book you were talking about    
[3:52:25](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13945) every book you mentioned is like at 
his fingertips so there's something no    
[3:52:28](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13948) no spiritual i think you know futurehat here some 
divine openings may allah bless you paul um we're    
[3:52:35](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13955) we're very happy to uh to have you among us 
you're a great great asset to our community    
[3:52:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13961) and uh uh yeah may allah may allah bless you 
and and uh and everyone who watches your channel    
[3:52:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13967) benefits from your channel and uh i'll just end as 
we uh normally do anything that i have said that    
[3:52:54](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13974) is right and true is from allah and we thank 
him for that all truth and goodness come from    
[3:52:59](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13979) the only true uh allah is the huck the truth 
itself and and good and beauty itself and    
[3:53:05](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13985) anything that is wrong or inaccurate it comes from 
me and for me alone and i ask your forgiveness    
[3:53:10](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13990) as an audience as well as allah's forgiveness for 
anything that i said that it might have been wrong    
[3:53:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13994) i hope i was not did not say anything that 
anyone might have found offensive it was not    
[3:53:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=13998) my intention to um i think in the larger context 
that was being said i tried to hit everything    
[3:53:24](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14004) from different angles to make exactly clear 
what i'm saying what i'm not saying these are    
[3:53:29](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14009) difficult issues um i i may allah help all muslims 
deal uh whether it's dealing again with society    
[3:53:36](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14016) and uh external pressures or whether it's 
dealing with this issue inside your own heart    
[3:53:41](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14021) or within your own family or community um this 
is not going to go away anytime soon and this    
[3:53:47](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14027) is something that we do have to know how to deal 
with properly and have mature conversations about    
[3:53:52](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14032) principal conversations but conversations 
that also the human element is involved    
[3:53:56](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14036) and we understand people are very confused in 
this time and we should also be you know without    
[3:54:01](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14041) letting again this sort of activist type run amok 
but be gentle with people people have been hearing    
[3:54:08](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14048) one narrative their entire lives right it it can 
take some time and some effort and some coaxing    
[3:54:14](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14054) to kind of get them to especially if they're 
dealing with that you know just be patient with    
[3:54:18](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14058) people and make dua for people and may allah guide 
all of us to what is best and what pleases him  
[3:54:27](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14067) yeah thank you thank you very much for 
your outstanding work presentation uh    
[3:54:32](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14072) and uh beautiful slides and this is going to be a 
great resource i'm certain for uh many people in    
[3:54:39](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14079) the months maybe the years to come for a a very 
comprehensive compassionate accurate faithful    
[3:54:48](https://youtu.be/_M4aHFvrCuI?t=14088) exposition on on the whole 
question of islam in the lgbt
