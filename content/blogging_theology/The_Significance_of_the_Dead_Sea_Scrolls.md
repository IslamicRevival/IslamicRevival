The Dead Sea Scrolls are an important discovery because they are accurate; they do not have any differences between what Hitler actually wrote and the first printed copy of his writings, which means that it is not right to say that the manuscript is accurate. Additionally, isaiah, which is a book that many scholars believe was compiled from multiple authors, does not mean that the prophet isaiah is right.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The Dead Sea Scrolls are manuscripts that date back to the 1st century BCE and confirm the accuracy of the Old Testament as we know it.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2')">0:00:02</a> The significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls, now i'm
often told often hear from Christians who say
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8')">0:00:08</a> the Dead Sea Scrolls they really took us much
further back in time and i got much earlier
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('12')">0:00:12</a> manuscripts and it confirms the Old Testament we
always had it's the same books the same content
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('19')">0:00:19</a> Isaiah is just the same Jeremiah's just the same
um is a is this true or not i mean what's really
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('26')">0:00:26</a> going on here is it more complicated than
that yeah no it's a very important it's a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('30')">0:00:30</a> very important thing uh the destiny scrolls are
huge hugely important for all sorts of reasons
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('35')">0:00:35</a> um not just not just the copies of the bible by
the way but also the that tells us a lot about
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('41')">0:00:41</a> this group of jews who were in these kind of
monastic-like communities uh these they have
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('46')">0:00:46</a> scenes um but some some of the Dead Sea Scrolls
are biblical manuscripts and they are a huge find
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('52')">0:00:52</a> the reason is because the Hebrew Bible that
we use today the people who use the hebrew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('58')">0:00:58</a> Bible actually in Hebrew and that are
translating the Hebrew Bible are basing
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('64')">0:01:04</a> their uh their translations on a manuscript that
was written around the year 1000 of the common era
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('70')">0:01:10</a> around 1 000 of the common era it's uh it
came from leningrad and so it's called codexis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('78')">0:01:18</a> jewish tribes in the middle ages when they
copied a manuscript they would destroy it
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('84')">0:01:24</a> because now they had a perfect copy of it
and they made sure the copy was perfect
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('90')">0:01:30</a> they had ways of doing that through the middle
ages the problem is what were scribes doing
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('95')">0:01:35</a> before the middle ages before they had these
rules well we had to guess they were getting
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('100')">0:01:40</a> it right and so um the dead sea scrolls were
discovered in 1947 and they have they include
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> portions of every book of the hebrew bible except
for uh except for the book of uh esther esther
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('116')">0:01:56</a> yeah um because yeah it turns out god is not named
in esther and so that for some reason that book's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> not among the dead sea scrolls most of the scrolls
we have are not complete scrolls the isaiah scroll
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> is a virtually complete scroll and it is very
very close in wording to the codex leningradensis
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('135')">0:02:15</a> right so that concept but that confirms the bible
we have today was historically accurate it was
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('141')">0:02:21</a> accurately transmitted no no it's got nothing to
do with it and so so i need to explain several
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('146')">0:02:26</a> things here because there's several points that
some people like overlook which is the first one
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('151')">0:02:31</a> people overlook that's true the isaiah scroll
but it's not true of other dead sea scrolls
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('156')">0:02:36</a> there are other dead sea scrolls the the scroll
of jeremiah that we have is um has a uh has
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('163')">0:02:43</a> differences from our jeremiah and the differences
from our jeremiah are like the differences that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('170')">0:02:50</a> come to us from the greek translation of jeremiah
in the septuagint in the greek greek bible
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('176')">0:02:56</a> that version of jeremiah is 15 shorter than the
leningradensis 15 uh so that's not very accurate
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('189')">0:03:09</a> and so so it's not that everything is like
the isaiah scroll the isaiah scrolls like
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('194')">0:03:14</a> the isaiah scroll but it doesn't prove that's
why it's always mentioned it's always showcased
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> oh look at isaiah is exactly the same
look at the perfection of transformation
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('202')">0:03:22</a> that's my first point that this this manuscript
by isaiah was written a thousand years before
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> leningrad's it's accurate but the others are
not the same second point um isaiah the prophet
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> was writing isaiah jerusalem was living in the
8th century bce so that means we don't have any
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('222')">0:03:42</a> manuscripts for the first over 700 years so
the fact that you have a manuscript that from
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('229')">0:03:49</a> say say the year one to the year 1000 you can
show that isaiah was copied accurately but our
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('236')">0:03:56</a> question is what about between the year 700 bce
and one now there's 700 years we have no evidence
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('245')">0:04:05</a> in hebrew no hebrew text so you can't say this
is exactly what isaiah wrote how would you know
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('250')">0:04:10</a> how much it got changed between 700 and the
dead sea scroll copy there's no way to know
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('256')">0:04:16</a> there are ways not good ways no no um
so that's that's second third thing
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('263')">0:04:23</a> even if even if we had everything that was
accurate in either any book the new testament
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('270')">0:04:30</a> or the new testament old testament even if
we had a manuscript even we had the original
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> suppose we had the original of mark or suppose
we have the original of uh joshua we have the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('281')">0:04:41</a> original that would have no bearing on the
question of whether it's accurate or not
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('289')">0:04:49</a> it would only have a bearing on
whether we know what the author wrote
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('293')">0:04:53</a> so the way i usually illustrate this is we
have we have millions of copies of mineconf  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('303')">0:05:03</a> and they are accurate they i mean they might
not be active with what hitler actually wrote
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> but they don't they don't have any differences
we know what the first printed copy looked like
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('316')">0:05:16</a> does that mean that it's accurate no it doesn't
mean that it's right it just means you know what
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> he wrote the fact you know what somebody wrote
doesn't mean that what they wrote is right
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326')">0:05:26</a> that's a different thing so those are three really
big points that shows that this argument just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('330')">0:05:30</a> doesn't hold and any one of those three shows that
they've been hold three together forget it yeah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338')">0:05:38</a> it's not worse than that because a good example
of isaiah is now commonly accepted that yeah maybe
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> the first 39 chapters of isaiah
were written by this prophet
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('346')">0:05:46</a> in isaiah from downtown jerusalem but it was
added to by maybe a second scribe or maybe a third
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('353')">0:05:53</a> scribe or scribes so we don't even even if you
dig up the book of isaiah that we have it today
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('359')">0:05:59</a> from 500 years ago 600 years ago it doesn't
mean we have the prophet isaiah's own words
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('364')">0:06:04</a> which many scholars were added to anyway yeah
yeah no it's very common to think that i isaiah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> and if there's really good reason for this isaiah
jerusalem wrote most of chapter 1 to 39 and then
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('376')">0:06:16</a> someone 150 years later wrote 40 to 50 55 50 yeah
55 then the other 56 and on and so you know it's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('383')">0:06:23</a> a compilation uh no matter what but even if you
have isaiah's words again it doesn't it doesn't
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('390')">0:06:30</a> mean that he's right he might be right i mean
but that's a different it's a different question
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('396')">0:06:36</a> the fact you have an accurate manuscript is not
evidence that what the person said is accurate
