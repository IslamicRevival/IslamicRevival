 psychiatrist Paul Williams talks about the Islamic perspective on death. He explains that Muslims see death as a natural passage from one dimension of existence to another, and that it is the responsibility of the believer to be prepared for it. He recommends performing wudu, reciting the Quran, and giving charity on behalf of the deceased as ways of helping the deceased to prepare for the hereafter.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ReVKmGz-LE&t=0)** This psychiatrist says that in Islam, death is nothing more than the passage from one dimension of existence into another, and the believer knows that as the hadith states, "the world is the prison of the believer and the garden of the disbeliever." He encourages regular visits to the cemetery to remember death. This attitude of detachment from the world and meditation on the hereafter is gradually forced on them, so that when the time comes, they are thoroughly prepared.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ReVKmGz-LE&t=300)**  Dr. Paul Williams talks about the Islamic perspective on death. He discusses how Muslims view death as a natural process that should be attended by godly people who will remind the deceased to say Allah by simply repeating it in his ear. He also discusses the importance of performing wudu and reciting the Quran during the dying process. Finally, he discusses the importance of family visiting the deceased's tomb, giving charity on behalf of the deceased, and praying for them.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ReVKmGz-LE&t=600)**  Paul Williams discusses what death is from an Islamic perspective. He discusses the wisdom behind the concept and recommends a book on the topic.

[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=32) we have said earlier that death is  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=34) nothing more than the passage from one  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=36) dimension of existence into another  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=39) and the believer knows that as the

[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=59) pleasures as so many obstacles standing  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=63) between them and their goal  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=66) they struggle against their own egos and  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=69) feel their brother's sufferings as  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=71) acutely as they feel their own  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=75) they are constantly resisting the  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=77) downward pull of the world and are  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=79) offended and aggrieved by deviant  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=81) behavior in others  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=84) they also know that quote those who love

[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=90) that's a hadith in muslim  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=93) and they know of the peace and delights  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=96) of the garden and the beatific vision of  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=99) the divine countenance

[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=107) the greater will be his attachment to  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=109) the world and reluctance to separate  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=112) from it this is why we are strongly  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=115) encouraged to remember death frequently  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=118) remember often the defeater of death  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=121) remember often the defeater of pleasures  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=124) death that's a hadith in eternity said  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=127) the prophet  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=128) may god's blessings and peace be upon  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=130) him  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=132) and when asked  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=133) who among believers are the most  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=135) sagacious sagacious means wise he  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=139) replied  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=140) those who remember death most often and  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=143) are the best in preparing for what  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=145) follows it  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=146) those are the sagacious  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=149) that's hadith  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=153) he encouraged regular visits to the  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=156) cemetery for the same reason  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=158) the remembrance of death detaches one  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=161) from the world reduces everything in it  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=163) to its proper proportions and renders  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=166) death and the events that are to follow  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=169) it familiar and much less frightening  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=173) this makes death itself much easier  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=177) most muslims nowadays however are  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=180) ignorant of these things and others  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=182) horrified by the mere mention of death  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=186) their attitude is thus the exact  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=188) opposite of what it ought to be  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=191) they come that much closer to the  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=193) disbelievers stance  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=196) who because they know of no paradise  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=199) apart from this life  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=201) are exceedingly reluctant to leave it  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=203) and can never understand that someone in  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=206) his right mind should be eager to do so  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=211) one of the obvious mercies that god  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=213) bestows upon his nation  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=216) is that many of those muslims who live  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=219) in forgetfulness of their lives to come  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=222) are made to suffer a long illness before  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=225) their death  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=226) when i read this sentence by the way  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=228) when i first read it i was  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=230) wow that's such an extraordinary thing  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=232) to say and so  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=234) you know it's a paradigm shift in how we  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=236) perceive illness and death just read it  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=238) again i think it's such an amazing  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=240) statement one of the obvious mercies he  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=242) says  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=243) that god bestows upon his nation in  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=245) other words the ummah the worldwide  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=247) group of muslims is that many of those  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=249) muslims who live in forget in  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=251) forgetfulness of their lives to come  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=255) are made to suffer a long illness before  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=258) their death  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=260) the result is that detachment from the  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=262) world and meditation on the hereafter is  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=265) gradually forced on them  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=267) so that when the time comes they are  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=270) thoroughly prepared so that's why this  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=273) psychiatrist says it's a mercy long  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=275) illness because it makes you face the  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=277) realities rather than a quick end  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=280) that is why the notion he writes of  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=282) euthanasia  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=284) does not arise in a muslim climate  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=288) some of the west's current attitude that  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=290) life must be prolonged at any cost has  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=293) crept in  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=295) however especially among muslim medical  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=298) practitioners of course this author is a  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=300) doctor himself so he's talking about his  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=302) colleagues  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=304) and by the same token the islamic  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=305) concern in providing the muslim with a  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=308) dignified death has weakened  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=311) to insist on saving someone's life at  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=315) all costs may mean in many instances  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=318) keeping him in intensive care with tubes  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=321) coming out of every single orifice  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=324) unable to speak or say the shahada  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=327) and distracted by the frantic activities  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=330) of the staff isn't that a horrible image  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=333) you know but seeking to prolong life  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=336) what how whatever cost however degrading  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=339) it may be for the dignity of the person  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=342) this extraordinary um image and that's  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=344) where we're at today in hospitals in the  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=346) west  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=348) it is much more important to allow a  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=350) muslim to die as he should  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=352) than to try to save his life at the cost  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=354) of robbing him of his opportunity to do  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=358) so  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=359) for dying should be attended by godly  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=362) people who will remind him to say allah  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=366) by simply repeating it in his ear not by  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=369) commanding him to say it  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=371) they should also recite yah sin as a  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=374) chapter in the quran and other portions  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=377) of the quran and continuously pray for  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=379) him  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=381) the dying should be helped to remain in  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=383) a state of ritual purity and to repeat  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=386) their wudu  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=387) whenever broken and they should be  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=389) reminded of the immensity of god's mercy  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=393) of the expected intercession by the  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=395) prophet upon whom be peace and of other  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=398) hopeful things  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=399) in this way the dying person may die  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=403) hoping for god's mercy and expecting his  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=406) forgiveness for god says in the hadith  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=409) could see  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=410) i am as my servant thinks me to be  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=416) that's a hadith by the way in bukhari  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=418) and muslim  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=420) as for the family of the deceased they  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=423) should be attended to by comforting them  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=426) and assisting them through their  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=427) mourning  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=429) the expression of sorrow pain and anger  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=432) is encouraged and accepted providing it  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=435) does not turn into histrionics which are  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=438) strictly forbidden and sometimes you get  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=441) these images of people wailing and  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=443) screaming and you know basically going  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=445) insane when someone pop this in islam is  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=448) completely unacceptable  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=451) in islam as he says they are allowed to  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=453) weep and mourn in full but never to slap  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=455) their faces or to rend their clothes  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=458) ripping on ripping their clothes  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=459) although it obviously happens at times  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=462) they are reminded that quote god is more  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=465) compassionate to them than a mother is  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=468) to her infant that's a quote from ibn  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=471) maja hadith  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=473) that this is another trial that they  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=476) must suffer and that if they would only  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=478) allow him that god god will help them  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=482) and fortitude and put fortitude in their  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=485) hearts forgive their sins and raise

[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=547) until recently people of both sexes were  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=550) encouraged to remarry not very long  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=552) after losing their spouse  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=554) this resulted in the effective  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=556) reorganization of their lives materially  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=559) and emotionally and the adequate

[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=564) isn't that interesting  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=566) anger and resentment against heaven and  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=569) the possibility of psychological  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=571) dysfunction are again more likely to  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=574) occur the more remote the bereaved  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=577) person's cognitive structure is from the  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=580) islamic values and principles outlined  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=583) earlier  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=585) obviously such people will need more  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=588) intensive attention  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=590) let's end of that isn't that

[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=601) west we won't hear about this  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=603) perspective normally muslims in the  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=605) headlines are obviously uh associated  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/5ReVKmGz-LE?t=608) with uh egregious uh activities but here
