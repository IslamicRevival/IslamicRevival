The Prophet Muhammad is said to have missed a black woman who used to sweep the mosque. When he asked about her, the people told him she had died. He asked why they hadn't told him, and it appeared they had treated her as if she were of little account. He then prayed over her and told the people that these graves are filled with darkness, but Allah will light them up through his prayers.
