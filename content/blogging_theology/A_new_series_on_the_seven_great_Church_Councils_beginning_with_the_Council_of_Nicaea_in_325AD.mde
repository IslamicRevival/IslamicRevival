## Description

The First Council of Nicaea was a council of Christian bishops convened in the city of Nicaea (now İznik in Turkey) by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in AD 325. It produced the Nicene Creed the most widely accepted summary of Christian belief about God and Jesus.

In the history of Christianity, the first seven councils include the following: the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the First Council of Constantinople in 381, the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Second Council of Constantinople in 553, the Third Council of Constantinople from 680–681 and finally, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

God willing I will produce a separate video on each council.

The video discusses the seven great Church Councils, beginning with the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The Council of Nicaea decided that Jesus was both God and man, and that the Father and Son shared the same substance. This doctrine, called the Trinity, was later defined in the Creed of the Church. The video then recommends a book about the Council of Nicaea called "When Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity During the Last Days of Rome."

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDMqo1jMVH4&t=0)** The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD was a meeting of bishops from throughout the Christian world to discuss what the Christian faith should be. The council is still recited in every mass on Sunday, and virtually all other churches subscribe to it.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDMqo1jMVH4&t=300)** The seven great Church Councils are discussed in this video, beginning with the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The Council of Nicaea decided that Jesus was both God and man, and that the Father and Son shared the same substance. This doctrine, called the Trinity, was later defined in the Creed of the Church. The Council had nothing to do with the doctrine of the trinity, which was left until later. Two of the most common misconceptions about the Church are that it decided which gospels would become part of the Bible and that it created the doctrine of the trinity.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDMqo1jMVH4&t=600)** The seven great Church Councils are summarized, including the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The video then goes on to recommend a book about the Council of Nicaea called "When Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity During the Last Days of Rome."

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=1) hello and um i'd like to begin  
[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=3) a series of seven videos looking at the  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=7) seven  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=8) councils of the church these are the  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=10) great  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=11) gatherings of all the bishops in  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=13) christendom of the church  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=14) who met on seven occasions over many  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=16) centuries  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=18) to thrash out or agree to reach a  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=20) consensus  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=22) on what christians should believe on  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=24) christian doctrine on the christian  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=26) creed  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=27) and i think it's useful to look at this  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=29) and also perhaps to offer some comments  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=31) on it as well in the light  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=32) of the christian's own scriptures and  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=35) what we now know of the historical jesus  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=37) and the way  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=38) theology doctrine has evolved and  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=40) developed over the centuries  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=43) so um i think there's an opportunity to  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=45) look at seven different videos at the  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=47) seven councils  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=49) starting with the the most famous  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=51) council of them all the council of  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=53) nicaea  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=54) in the fourth century um so why is this  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=58) important  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=58) why is this not just a bit of ancient  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=60) history well the council of nicaea  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=63) for example is still recited in every  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=66) mass on sunday  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=68) so christians throughout the world who  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=70) are roman catholic  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=71) uh recite read out uh the council of  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=75) nicaea so it re and that's the biggest  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=78) church in the world  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=80) and virtually all other churches main  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=83) churches  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=84) agree that this council is true and they  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=86) subscribe to it it's their doctrine it's  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=88) it expresses their faith uh in the most  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=91) succinct way  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=92) uh whether it be the church of england  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=94) or the methodist church or or whoever  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=96) but that with the exception of um say  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=99) that you have his witnesses  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=101) most other churches accepted  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=104) so um i want to talk about these creeds  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=107) what they mean  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=108) why they were formulated why they're  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=110) important and also offer a few points  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=112) of comment by way as i say of um  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=116) what the historical jesus uh apparently  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=119) said and what even the christian's own  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=120) bible  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=122) says by way of contrast  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=125) so what was the counts of nicaea why is  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=127) it called the council of nicaea well  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=129) the nicaea was a town in what is today  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=134) called turkey  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=135) and it was chosen by the then emperor  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=138) constantine  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=139) as a convenient place in the center of  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=141) the roman empire  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=143) in 325 a.d where all the bishops who  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=146) were called were invited from other  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=148) world from britain  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=149) from greece from italy  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=152) from uh from the east  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=156) wherever they may be were called over a  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=157) thousand bishops were invited  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=159) uh in the end only about three 318  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=162) the number varies and the sources  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=164) actually were able to attend along with  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=166) all their assistants and fellow priests  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=168) and presbyters and deacons so  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=170) it's actually quite a large number of  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=171) people who attended we have  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=174) some records uh from that time a chap  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=177) called eusebius kept a record  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=179) um so we have some idea what actually  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=181) happened  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=183) but uh constantine the the emperor was  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=186) um  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=186) the guy who was uh in charge and he  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=189) wanted  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=190) a creed uh to express the common faith  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=193) of the church  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=194) because at that time be both before and  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=197) after actually the church was in  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=198) conflict was riven apart by  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=200) disagreements over who jesus  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=204) was and there were other issues as well  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=205) but this was the biggest  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=207) theological issue of all the churchmen  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=210) lead church leaders like say athanasius  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=212) who is a  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=214) a pretty famous high-profile bishop in  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=216) alexandria in uh  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=218) today's egypt he defended the idea  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=222) that jesus was god just like the father  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=224) was god father was god  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=226) jesus was god there were other people  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=228) some of who were bishops but perhaps the  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=230) most famous one was called  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=231) arius and arius um  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=234) was what's called a presbyter kind of  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=236) like a priest  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=238) also from the same part of the world who  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=241) although  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=242) he agreed that jesus was divine  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=245) believed actually that there was a time  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=247) when he did not exist  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=248) and that was almost his catchphrase that  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=250) the son uh was god but there was a time  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=253) when he was not  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=254) he didn't exist only the father existed  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=256) from all eternity  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=257) the son ultimately although he was the  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=260) greatest  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=261) and existed before anything else was  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=263) created was ultimately  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=265) created by god so the sun was in a sense  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=268) a created god  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=269) if you like and many people in the  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=273) church  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=273) at that time agreed but many people also  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=277) agreed with athanasius  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=279) and uh in those days when christians  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=281) disagreed they got violent and  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=283) particularly athanasius had a reputation  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=285) for being a bit of a thug  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=286) and um it was alleged that he uh  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=289) through various mercenaries he got  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=291) people beaten up for their theological  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=293) views  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=294) and even people famously in the  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=295) marketplace used to argue and get a bit  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=298) violent  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=298) um about theological disputes about the  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=301) trinity  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=301) and about jesus and whatever um it  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=304) reminds me somewhat of muslims who are  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=306) so passionate about their faith some are  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=308) that they uh do things they shouldn't  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=310) in those days christians fulfill that  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=313) role today's christians  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=315) are pretty lukewarm and securized don't  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=317) really mind if they get walked all over  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=318) by  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=319) by other people and their faith is  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=321) insulted and they say oh well  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=322) we should make fun of our religion we're  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=324) happy with that but  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=326) um but in the fourth century christians  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=328) took their faith very seriously and  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=329) wouldn't have put up with any nonsense  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=331) um anyway so this council meets um  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=335) and um the arguments take place between  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=338) uh those representing athanasius the  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=341) bishop  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=341) who defended the idea that jesus was god  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=344) um  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=345) and the idea that the father and the son  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=348) shared the same being the same substance  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=352) the word in greek and this is a bit of  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=353) jargon but it's gone down in history  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=356) is homousion homo meaning the same  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=359) and usion coming from the greek word  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=361) uzia meaning  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=362) being excuse me or substance same beings  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=366) in this word  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=367) homo usion entered into the vocabulary  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=369) of the church  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=370) and it's still part of the vocabulary of  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=371) the church in its understanding of the  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=373) relationship between the father and the  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=375) son  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=376) between the father who's god and jesus  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=378) is god they share the same sub they're  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=380) both  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=380) divine they're both god in the absolute  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=383) sense  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=384) whereas those who are opposed to the  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=387) idea of  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=388) jesus being the uncreated god people  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=390) like arius  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=392) rejected that term and they rejected it  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=394) on the good sound principle that  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=396) actually  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=396) it's not in the bible it's simply not  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=398) there in the jewish bible it's not  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=400) they're the new testament jesus never  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=401) preached homoresion neither did the  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=403) apostles needed the  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=404) paul or anyone so why are we using this  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=408) bidder this innovative term to describe  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=411) the god head the term comes from pagan  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=414) philosophy from greek philosophy  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=415) anyway so at the end of the day  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=419) a vote was taken and this is how  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=422) doctrine was created  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=425) at some crucial points in the church  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=427) through majority  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=428) votes and the majority vote was that  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=432) athanasius was right and god  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=435) was declared to be the father and the  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=439) son  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=440) so uh those who were disagreed  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=443) were banished so there's a great  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=444) incentive to vote the way the  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=447) emperor wanted you to vote and he  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=449) supported the ideas of athanasius  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=451) and if you didn't support the uh the  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=453) views of the roman empire  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=455) and the emperor uh then you were  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=457) banished  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=458) which was not a punishment that you'd  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=460) want so  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=461) um the the council uh agreed  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=464) uh with athanasius as i was saying  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=467) and the creed that came out of creed is  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=470) a statement of belief like  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=471) akida basically uh which is the arabic  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=474) term  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=475) um the arab the nicene creed was created  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=478) and it had  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=478) phrases like jesus been described as  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=481) light from light  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=482) true god from true god that was one  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=484) expression from the  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=486) nicen creed that proclaims his divinity  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=488) jesus christ is said to be begotten  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=491) not made i'm not quite sure what  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=493) begotten means because if you beget  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=494) something that implies  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=495) priority ontological priority of the one  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=498) who is begetting but hey  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=500) uh begotten not made uh asserting  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=503) therefore that he was not a mere  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=504) creature brought out of brought into  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=507) being out of nothing like  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=508) aries believed but uh of the same  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=511) substance  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=512) as the father um so  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=516) at homorescius as i say or  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=517) consubstantial that's  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=519) another term from latin  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=522) meaning of the same substance um so this  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=526) creed was  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=527) uh declared to be binding on all  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=529) christians  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=531) and we still have it recited today as i  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=533) say now there are a couple of  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=535) misconceptions  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=536) um which have become quite popular in  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=539) recent years one is that  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=541) somehow the idea that the bible the  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=543) biblical canon the gospels  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=545) were somehow decided which gospels would  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=548) become part of the new testament of that  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=550) time and which were  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=551) rejected this is complete border dash  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=554) there's no evidence in history  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=555) for that um the main source of the idea  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=559) that the canon i the list of books to go  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=562) into the bible was created at the  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=564) council and i say it seems to be  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=565) voltaire who's a  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=566) 18th century french guy he popularized  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=568) the story  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=570) um so that that is um a falsehood  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=573) that's a an urban myth call it that the  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=576) other  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=576) uh misconception um perhaps more serious  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=579) is the idea that the council  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=582) created the doctrine of the trinity or  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=584) discussed the trinity  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=586) um the council had nothing to do with  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=588) the trinity as i say it was to deal with  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=589) the issue of the deity of christ  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=593) questions of the holy spirit um  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=596) this is the third so-called third person  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=598) of trinity that was not  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=599) that was left until another year  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=603) in fact um that was discussed really in  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=605) the fourth century  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=607) at the council of constantinople one of  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=609) the other councils  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=610) that i hopefully god willing will be  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=613) addressing  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=614) in another video so um  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=617) that in summary is a very brief uh  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=620) synopsis of  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=621) what happened at the council it's the  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=623) most important christian council in  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=625) history uh still uh influencing  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=628) christians today what might one say  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=631) about it in view of the bible  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=633) and the historical jesus well that's  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=636) where it gets a bit  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=637) awkward because just to give you just  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=640) a couple of examples in the earliest  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=642) gospel gospel of mark  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=644) in the new testament um there's a story  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=647) in chapter 10  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=648) uh verse 17 onwards where uh i don't  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=651) know this is a true story but this is  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=652) what the gospel says  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=654) he says a man a rich man young man came  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=656) to jesus and said good teacher  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=658) what must i do to inherit eternal life  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=661) jesus said why do you call me good  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=665) there is no one good but god alone  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=669) now this verse is usually understood to  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=671) mean that jesus was denying that he was  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=672) god  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=674) there's another verse in the bible um  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=676) where jesus  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=677) says um again historicity is debated but  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=680) anyway it's there in the bible  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=682) the father is greater than i the father  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=685) is greater than i  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=686) so obviously he both can't be god if one  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=689) of the  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=689) persons of the godhead is greater than  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=691) the other god is god after all  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=693) so that's a bit of an odd thing to have  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=696) in your bible if you believe in what  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=698) nicaea  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=699) determined and another verse in john's  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=702) gospel  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=702) um in chapter 17 verse 3 and i'll just  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=704) read it to you this is  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=706) where jesus prays for his disciples and  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=708) he is said  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=709) and this is eternal life so this really  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=712) matters  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=713) that they may know you the only true god  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=716) and jesus christ whom you have sent so  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=719) this is jesus praying  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=721) this is eternal life that they may know  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=723) you  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=724) god the only true god and  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=727) jesus christ whom you have sent so  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=730) clearly  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=731) god and jesus are two separate beings  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=734) jesus is not god he's praying to god  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=736) and he refers to the father only as  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=739) the true god so that verse sits very  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=743) uncomfortably  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=744) to put it mildly with the counts of  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=746) nicer's insistence that  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=748) jesus as well is god and indeed there  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=751) are countless verses  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=753) in the new testament even in the  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=755) christian new testament  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=756) which suggests that jesus is not god  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=758) jesus doesn't know the day to the end he  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=760) gets tired  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=761) he is not omniscient he dies on a cross  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=764) god doesn't die according to the bible  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=766) according to the crown god is eternal  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=767) he's immortal  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=768) how can an immortal eternal god  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=772) die and so on and so on and so on so  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=775) um this this is a a an issue which will  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=779) haunt christians as people look in the  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=781) bible and say hey  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=782) your bible doesn't quite match up with  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=784) the beliefs of nicaea  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=786) now in terms of recommended reading  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=788) there are several books i would  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=789) recommend if you really want to go into  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=790) this now  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=791) it's a great it's a great story uh this  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=793) one i recommend  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=794) a lot it's called when jesus became god  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=796) the struggle to define  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=798) christianity during the last days of  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=800) rome by richard  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=801) rubinstein he's an american academic and  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=803) there's a very  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=804) readable story there of the council  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=806) itself how it came to be  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=809) what happened the debate the arguments  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=811) what happened to the people who lost the  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=812) vote and were persecuted

[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=820) when i was at university studying this  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=822) very council which i did  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=824) some research on this was one of the  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=826) main  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=827) books that was on the bibliography and i  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=829) i i've always treasured this jd kelly  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=832) was a  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=832) an anglican historian theologian and  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=835) this is the  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=835) the go-to reference work if you want to  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=838) really get into the history the theology  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=840) of this academically  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=842) he also wrote this book um which

[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=847) jnd kelly  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=849) the one on christian doctrines is i  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=850) think the the better one  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=853) so that is it for now next time god  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=856) willing i will address the next council  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=858) why it was convened uh why it's  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=861) important and some of the criticisms  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=863) one might make of it from a monotheist  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=866) unitarian  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=867) muslim perspective um in the light of  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=870) and also in the light of what we know  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=871) from biblical studies as well  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/xDMqo1jMVH4?t=873) so i hope that it is of some interest
