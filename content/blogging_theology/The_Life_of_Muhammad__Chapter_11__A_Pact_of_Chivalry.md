His uncle taught him how to use a sword and a shield, and Muhammad soon became a skilled fighter. He also became skilled in archery, and was praised for his skills. In response to a merchant who was wronged, Muhammad led a large group of people in an appeal to quraish to help him get justice. quraish responded immediately and helped the merchant get his revenge.

[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=34) hamza was clearly destined to be a man  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=36) of mighty stature endowed with great  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=39) physical strength  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=41) he was already a good swordsman and a

[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=45) muhammad was of average height and

[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=49) he had a marked aptitude for archery and  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=52) gave every promise of being an excellent  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=55) bowman like his great ancestors abraham  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=58) and ishmael  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=60) a powerful asset for this lay in the  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=62) strength of his eyesight he was reputed  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=65) to be able to count no less than 12 of  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=68) the stars of the constellation of the  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=70) pleiades  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=73) in those years quraysh were not involved  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=75) in any fighting except for sporadic and  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=78) intermittent conflict which came to be  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=81) known as the sacrilegious war because it  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=84) has started in one of the sacred months  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=88) a profligate of kinana had treacherously  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=91) murdered a man of emir one of the  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=93) howards in tribes of najd and had taken  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=96) refuge in the impregnable fortress  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=99) township  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=100) of khabar  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=102) the secret of sequence of events  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=104) followed the usual desert pattern  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=107) honour demanded revenge so the tribe of  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=109) the murdered man attacked kanana the  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=113) tribe of the murderer and creature were  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=115) involved somewhat in gloriously as  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=118) allies of kinana  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=120) the conflict dragged on for three or  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=123) four years in which there were only five  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=126) days of actual fighting  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=129) the head of the clan of hashem was at  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=131) that time zubair  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=134) full brother like abu talib of  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=136) muhammad's father  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=138) zubair and abu talib took their nephew  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=142) muhammad with them to one of the first  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=144) battles  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=145) but they said he was too young to fight  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=148) he was nonetheless allowed to help by  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=150) gathering enemy arrows that had missed  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=153) their mark and handling them to handing  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=156) them to his uncles so that they could be  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=159) shot back with them  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=161) but at one of the subsequent battles  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=163) where quresh and their allies had the  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=165) worst of the day he was allowed to show  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=168) his skill as a bowman and was praised  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=171) for his valor  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=173) the war helped to fan the growing  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=175) discontent which every sedentary  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=178) community tends to feel with the law of  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=181) the desert  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=183) most of the leading men of quraish had  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=185) traveled to syria and had seen for  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=187) themselves the relative justice which  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=190) prevailed in the roman empire  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=193) it was also possible in abyssinia to  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=196) have justice without recourse to  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=198) fighting  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=200) but in arabia there was no comparable  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=203) system of law by which a victim of crime  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=206) or his family might obtain redress  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=210) and it was natural that the sacrilegious  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=212) war like other conflicts before it  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=215) should have set many minds thinking of  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=217) ways and means to prevent the same thing  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=220) from happening again  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=223) but this time the result was more than  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=225) mere thoughts and words  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=228) as far as quraish were concerned there  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=230) was now a widespread readiness to take  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=233) action  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=234) and their sense of justice was put to  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=236) the test by a scandalous incident which  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=239) took place in mecca in the first few  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=242) weeks after the end of the fighting  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=246) and here is the story a merchant from  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=248) the yemeni port azabeed had sold some  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=252) valuable goods to a notable of the clan  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=256) of sham  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=257) having taken possession of these the  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=259) shamite refused to pay the promised  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=262) price  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=263) the wronged merchant as his wronger well  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=266) knew was a stranger to mecca and had no  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=270) confederate or patron in all the city to  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=273) whom he might go for help  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=276) but he was not to be overawed by the  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=278) other man's insolent self-assurance and  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=282) taking his stand on the slope of abu  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=284) kubays he appealed to quraish as a whole  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=288) with loud and vehement eloquence to see  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=291) that justice was done  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=294) an immediate response came from most of  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=296) those clans which had no traditional  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=298) alliance with sham  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=300) quresh were bent above all on being  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=303) united regardless of clan  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=307) but within that union there was still an  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=309) acute consciousness of the rift which  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=312) had divided them over the legacy of  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=315) crusade into two groups the scented ones  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=318) and the confederates  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=320) and sham were of the confederates  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=324) one of the leaders of the other group  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=326) and one of the wealthiest men of mecca  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=329) at that time  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=330) was the chief of tame abd allah ibn  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=334) juden  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=335) and he now offered his large house as a  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=338) meeting place for all lovers of justice  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=342) from among the centered ones only the  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=344) clans of abu shams and nowfall were  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=348) absent  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=349) hashem muttalib zura assad tame were all  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=353) well represented and they were joined by  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=356) adi  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=357) which had been one of the confederates  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=360) having decided after an earnest  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=362) discussion that it was imperative to  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=365) found an order of chivalry for the  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=367) furtherance of justice and the  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=369) protection of the weak  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=371) they went in a body to the kaaba where  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=373) they poured water over the black stone  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=377) letting it flow into a receptacle  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=381) then each man drank of the thus hallowed  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=384) water and with their right hands raised  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=387) above their heads they vowed that  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=389) henceforth at every act of oppression in  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=392) mecca they would stand together as one  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=395) man on the side of the oppressed against  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=399) the oppressor until justice was done  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=402) whether the oppressed were a man or  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=404) quraish or one who had come from abroad  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=408) the sarmite was thereupon compelled to  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=412) pay his debt nor did any of those clans  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=415) which had abstained from the pack offer  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=418) him any of their assistance  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=421) together with the chief of tame zubair  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=424) of hashem was one of the founders of  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=427) this order and he brought with him his  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=429) nephew mohammed  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=431) who took part in the oath and who said  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=434) in after years  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=436) i was present in the house of abdullah  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=439) ibn judah at so excellent a pact that i  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=443) would not exchange my part in it for a  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=446) herd of red camels  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=449) and if now in islam i was summoned unto  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=453) it i would gladly respond  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/nRCX73fSUMA?t=458) another of those present was their
