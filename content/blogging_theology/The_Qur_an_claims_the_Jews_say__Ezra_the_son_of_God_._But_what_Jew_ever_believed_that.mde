![alt The Qur'an claims the Jews say 'Ezra the son of God'. But what Jew ever believed that?](N4w9gU5YO40.jpg "The Qur'an claims the Jews say 'Ezra the son of God'. But what Jew ever believed that?")

## Description

Qur'an 9:30: The Jews say: "Ezra ('Uzair) is Allah's son," and the Christians say: "The Messiah is the son of Allah." These are merely verbal assertions in imitation of the sayings of those unbelievers who preceded them. May Allah ruin them. How do they turn away from the Truth?

Muslims often get this wrong and its important to be aware of what it really says. 

‘Uzair is the son of God’

What Jew believes Uzair is the son of God? I have never come across a Jew who believes that.

Some Muslims say it is Ezra the scribe who arrogated to himself semi-divine prerogatives when he reestablishing the text of the Torah after the Babylonian exile.

Uzair - Ezra doesn’t actually work if you look at the languages.

The best explanation which has been developed by many western historians including professor Gordon Newby in his book ‘A history of the Jews of Arabia’ is that it is not Ezra at all - its about Metatron (Yes Metatron!) - in medieval rabbinic Judaism it was assumed that in order to preserve that absolute unqualified unity of the Godhead you had to presuppose there was a kind of secondary emanation of god that was the conscious personal God that created the world and to whom you could pray. A subordinate deity. Metatron was indeed the object of worship of many medieval Jews. Dr Tim Winter says that at the library at Cambridge university are many medieval Jewish manuscripts that contain prayers to Metatron.

Gordon Newby and others have demonstrated that Uzair is associated with the prophet Enoch (Idris in the Qur’an) who is assimilated to Metatron in rabbinical piety.

So when the Quran says, the Jews say Uzair is the son of God, it’s saying they worship Metatron.

The Quran obviously does not approve. And some Jews didn’t either - Jews called the Karaites dismissed Rabbinical Judaism as polytheistic because of this Metatron idea.

So the Quran's polemic is directed against a medieval Jewish aberration rather than what you might find taught in an orthodox Jewish synagogue today. Dr Tim Winter says the Qur'an is NOT criticising Judaism as such but taking the Jewish Karaite view over against the Rabbinate view.

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=2) hello and in this episode i want to  
[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=4) uh look at a verse which is often  
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=6) perplexed  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=8) muslims and others for for centuries  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=11) um and it's a very brief verse in the  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=14) quran surah number 9 sura al  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=16) tawba verse 30  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=19) and i'll just read you what it says and  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=22) the jews  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=23) say uzel ezra is the son  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=26) of god and the christians say messiah is  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=29) the son of god  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=30) that is they're saying with their mouths  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=32) resembling the saying of those who  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=33) disbelieved a full time  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=35) god's curse beyond them how they are  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=37) deluded away from the truth  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=39) so what is this ezra or  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=43) as it's usually translated uh  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=47) ezra but the arabic says uzair  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=50) what is this uh uzeir character and um  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=54) i've just been looking at what uh  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=56) professor tim winter at cambridge  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=58) university has been saying about this  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=59) i'm relying on his  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=61) uh research and he says that muslims  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=62) often get this wrong it's important to  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=64) be aware of what it really says  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=67) now what jew you may ask has ever  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=71) believed or believes that uzair  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=72) or ezra is the son of god i've never  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=75) come across a jew who believes that it's  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=77) not  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=77) a focal point of jewish spirituality or  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=79) worship that i've come across anyway  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=82) some muslims say that it is ezra the  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=86) scribe  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=87) uh who arrogated himself semi-divine  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=90) prerogatives  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=91) when he reestablished the text of the  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=93) torah  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=94) after the babylonian exile and that  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=96) story is told in uh the jewish texts and  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=99) and in the  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=100) uh the old testament but um  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=103) uzair in the arabic in the quran and  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=105) ezra doesn't actually work  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=107) if you look at the languages the best  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=110) explanation which has been developed  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=112) by many western historians  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=117) recently in the last few years including  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=118) professor gordon newby  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=120) in his book a history of jews in arabia  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=123) is that it's not ezra at  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=124) all it's about metatron yes metatron  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=129) not the hollywood character but uh in  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=132) medieval rabbinic judaism it was assumed  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=136) in their theology that in order to  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=138) preserve the absolute  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=140) unqualified unity of the godhead you had  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=143) to presuppose there was a kind of  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=144) secondary emanation of god that was the  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=147) conscious  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=148) personal god that created the world and  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=150) to you whom you could pray it's a bit  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=152) like  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=152) greek philosophy with a demiurge if  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=154) you're familiar with that  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=156) it was a kind of subordinate deity a  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=158) kind of lesser yahweh  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=160) metatron was indeed the object of  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=162) worship  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=163) of many medieval jews dr tim winter says  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=167) that at the library at cambridge  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=168) university there's a  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=170) whole treasure trove of medieval jewish  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=173) manuscripts  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=174) that mainly come from cairo that contain  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=178) prayers to metadron petitions and  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=180) prayers to metatron  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=183) um dr gorban newby and other historians  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=185) have demonstrated  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=187) that uzair is associated with the  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=190) prophet enoch  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=192) someone called idris in the bible in the  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=194) quran  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=195) who is assimilated to metatron in  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=198) rabbinic  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=199) piety so when  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=202) the quran says the jews say usaid is the  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=205) son of god  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=207) it's saying that they worship metatron  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=212) now obviously the quran doesn't approve  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=214) any more than it approves of people  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=215) worshipping  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=216) jesus interestingly  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=219) some jews didn't either at that time  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=222) there are jews called the  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=224) karaites um who still exists today  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=227) there's  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=227) still a few of them left even one at  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=229) speaker's corner chap called joseph  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=231) these people dismissed rabbinic judaism  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=234) why  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=235) because it was polytheistic because of  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=237) this metatron  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=238) idea so  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=243) the argument goes the quran's polemic  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=246) in this verse 930 is directed against  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=250) a medieval jewish aberration that was  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=253) very widely  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=254) practiced rather than what you might  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=256) find taught in an orthodox jewish  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=258) synagogue  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=259) today say in london um  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=262) tim winter suggests that the quran is  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=264) not criticizing judaism as such  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=267) but taking the jewish carrot view over  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=270) the ribbon  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=270) the rabbinite view so it's taking aside  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=273) or affirming one and criticizing  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=275) the other view so it's not condemning  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=278) judaism per se  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=279) it's criticizing this widespread  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=283) rabbinic practice of worshiping the  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=285) metatron  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=288) and in that context this verse  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=291) very very brief is a very rich  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=294) suggestive idea that really uh touches a  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=298) major phenomenon  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=299) in jewish worship uh at the medi in  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=302) during the medieval time for many  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=303) centuries  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=304) even though it may not be mainstream  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=307) today you're not going to find it taught  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=308) perhaps in  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=309) a standard synagogue course in an  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=312) orthodox jewish synagogue but  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=314) nevertheless it was a very significant  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=317) factor  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=317) for many many centuries amongst  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=320) ribbonic judaism so um that's the idea  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=324) and um i hope you found that that  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=326) interesting um it seems to be very well  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=328) grounded  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=329) in the texts um and in the research um  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=333) and uh it's it's it's the best  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=335) hypothesis around i think so  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/N4w9gU5YO40?t=337) there we are maybe see you next time bye
