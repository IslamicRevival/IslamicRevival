## Description

Welcome to Blogging Theology! 

Blogging Theology is my small attempt to introduce some academic and scholarly content to the subject matter of comparative religion, especially concerning the Abrahamic faiths Judaism, Christianity and Islam. 

I have been enormously privileged to interview leading scholars  from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Yale, Princeton, and Zaytuna College. I review books, occasionally talk about current affairs, and produce daily shorts. See also my ironically entitled ‘No design’ posts on the Community tab.  

You can follow Blogging Theology on Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter.

As this channel has grown larger I realise how important it is to control the content I produce so I would ask that folks ask my permission before copying videos and translating them into other languages. 

Thank you all for your wonderful support and encouragement. I really do appreciate it. 

Till next time!
