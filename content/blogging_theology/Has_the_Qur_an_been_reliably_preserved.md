The video discusses the reliability of the traditional Muslim narrative that the Quran was received and compiled by Prophet Muhammad directly from God. The leading Western experts on the Quran say that the traditional story is supported by evidence and has been discarded by scholars as a radical revisionist attack.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> Has the Quran been reliably transmitted ? The answer 
to that question will depend on whom you ask.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8')">0:00:08</a> If you ask Christian missionaries and apologists 
they'll say: NO , the Quran has not been reliably    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('15')">0:00:15</a> transmitted. But i want to ask a different group 
of people, the leading Western Experts on the Quran .    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('22')">0:00:22</a> These are not muslims , these are professors at 
Western Universities , and i want to get their view    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('28')">0:00:28</a> on this subject . And to get that answer , i'll 
turn to "The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'ān"  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('35')">0:00:35</a> this is published by Cambridge University 
Press . It's edited by Jane Dammen McAuliffe,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('41')">0:00:41</a> herself a scholar, and she has brought 
together an international team of scholars   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('48')">0:00:48</a> to talk about this subject and others as well ,
they discuss the formation of the Quranic text .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('55')">0:00:55</a> There's a description and analysis of the contents ,
transmission and dissemination , interpretations and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('61')">0:01:01</a> intellectual traditions and contemporary readings .
In all there are 14 chapters by the West's top    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('69')">0:01:09</a> scholars. I think they're all non-muslim 
maybe one or two judging by their names    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('75')">0:01:15</a> might be muslim but i'm not sure about that. Now 
this is definitely an academic text , it's written    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('80')">0:01:20</a> by scholars for students of the subject and i want 
to read from a chapter by a very distinguished    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('89')">0:01:29</a> professor of the Quran from the University 
of Berlin : Angelika Neuwirth , she's a name that's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('95')">0:01:35</a> very well known to students of the Quran in 
the West . And she discusses this subject    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('101')">0:01:41</a> about the reliability of the text and
also she offers her comments on the traditional    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('110')">0:01:50</a> story that muslims say about the origins of the 
Quran , about Uthman and so on . Is that something    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('115')">0:01:55</a> we can take seriously anymore or do we have 
to jettison that traditional muslim narrative    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('121')">0:02:01</a> about the reception and the origin of the Quran .
Now, iI'm going to read a couple of paragraphs    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> from this essay of hers: "Structural linguistic 
and literary features" is the chapter.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('135')">0:02:15</a> It's not very user-friendly , i'll 
admit that, but i'll try and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('139')">0:02:19</a> make some comments hopefully clarify what she's 
saying . I had to read it several times myself just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> to get the sense of what she's saying , but 
her conclusions are really important of course    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('149')">0:02:29</a> because these are experts , they're not christian 
missionaries with an axe to grind , to do down    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('156')">0:02:36</a> muslims and do down Islam and destroy the Quran 
basically , the credibility of the Quran in the eyes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> of people . So what do the top scholars say? on page 
100 Angelika Neuwirth writes: "The presentation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('171')">0:02:51</a> of Quranic development in this chapter presupposes 
the reliability of the basic data of traditional    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> accounts about the emergence of the Quran , assuming 
the transmitted Quranic text to be the genuine    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> collection of the communications of the prophet 
as pronounced during his activities at Mecca   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('192')">0:03:12</a> about 610 to 22 CE and again at Medina until 
his death at 632 CE . it is true that the earlier    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('202')">0:03:22</a> consensus of scholarly opinion on the origins of 
islam has since the publication of John Wansbrough's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('210')">0:03:30</a> "Quranic Studies" (this is in 1977 by the way)
and Patricia Crone and Michael Cook's "Hagarism"    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('217')">0:03:37</a> (also in 1977) this consensus
has been shattered (she says)  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('224')">0:03:44</a> and that various attempts at a new reconstruction 
of those origins have been put forward .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> as a whole however , the theories of the 
so-called skeptic or revisionist scholars who    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('240')">0:04:00</a> arguing historically make a radical break with 
the transmitted picture of islamic origins   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('247')">0:04:07</a> shifting them in both time and place from the 7th 
to the 8th or 9th century and from the Arabian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('254')">0:04:14</a> peninsula to the fertile crescent have by now 
been discarded . so just to pause there , she's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('262')">0:04:22</a> saying that the radical attacks in the 1970s 
and people like Patricia Crone , Michael Cook , John   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> Wansbrough which really criticized the traditional 
muslims narrative of the origins of the Quran ,   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('276')">0:04:36</a> this radical revisionist attack has basically 
been abandoned by scholars , it's been looked at ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> been analyzed , assessed and it's been found 
wanting , so it's now been discarded . these radical    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('290')">0:04:50</a> theories peddled by certain well-known shall we say missionaries like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('295')">0:04:55</a> i'll mention one name : J. Smith . these 
have been discarded now by serious scholars .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('302')">0:05:02</a> and then she says : though many of their critical 
observations remain challenging and still call for    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('307')">0:05:07</a> investigation . so they raise interesting questions 
but their basic theory of rejecting the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('315')">0:05:15</a> traditional account of the origins of the Quran 
has been discarded (in other words they rejected it) .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> then she goes on : new findings of the Quranic text 
fragments because (just to pause again) there    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('329')">0:05:29</a> have been so many earlier and earlier manuscript 
fragments or whole manuscripts of the Quran have    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('336')">0:05:36</a> been found over the recent years , we have a wealth 
of manuscript evidence now that goes back     
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('342')">0:05:42</a> within the first century of the time of the 
prophet and this makes a big difference . she says :  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('348')">0:05:48</a> new findings of Quranic text fragments moreover 
can be reduced to a firm rather than calling to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('354')">0:05:54</a> question the traditional picture of the Quran 
as an early fixed text composed of the surahs    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('361')">0:06:01</a> we have . so she's saying all these manuscripts 
confirm the traditional account that the Quran was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368')">0:06:08</a> fixed in the form we know it very very early on 
and we now know this because we have the evidence ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('375')">0:06:15</a> we have empirical evidence , hard facts , the actual 
manuscripts themselves which prove this (she says).  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('383')">0:06:23</a> Nor have scholars trying to deconstruct that image 
through linguistic arguments (so okay they now turn    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('389')">0:06:29</a> to other arguments "the radicals" using clever 
linguistic arguments), nor have scholars trying    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('396')">0:06:36</a> to deconstruct that image through linguistic 
arguments succeeded in seriously discrediting    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('402')">0:06:42</a> the genuineness of the Quran as we now know it. So 
she's saying that even these attacks have failed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('410')">0:06:50</a> and the genuineness of the Quran that we now have 
it has been vindicated (to put it in my own words).  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('416')">0:06:56</a> Now , she refers to the work of 
Christoph Luxenberg who views the Quran as an    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('422')">0:07:02</a> originally Syriac Arabic melange , later 
adapted to the rules of classical Arabic .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('428')">0:07:08</a> and Günter Lüling who reads the Quran as 
a collection of hymns composed in a Christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('435')">0:07:15</a> (believe it or not) Arabic dialect and 
later revised to fit the grammatical rules    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440')">0:07:20</a> newly established in the 8th and 9th centuries (so 
these are some of the crazy ideas that have been    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('448')">0:07:28</a> weighed and found wanting and dismissed). Whereas 
Lüling's reference to the earlier hypotheses of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455')">0:07:35</a> Karl Vollers, who had identified the original 
language of the Quran as broadly dialectical    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> points to a yet unresolved problem, Luxenberg's 
assumption of a Syriac-Arabic linguistic melange    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> as the original language of the Quran lacks 
a methodologically sound basis. (This is a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('475')">0:07:55</a> scholarly way of saying 'it's crap' I mean it just 
has no basis, there's no evidence for it , it's just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> hypothesis and speculation). She 
continues (to conclude): The alternative    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('488')">0:08:08</a> visions about the genesis of the Quran presented 
by Wansbrough , Cook and Lüling and luxenberg  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('496')">0:08:16</a> are not only mutually exclusive (in other 
words, they all contradict each other) .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('501')">0:08:21</a> but rely on textual observations that are too 
selective to be compatible with a comprehensive    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('508')">0:08:28</a> Quranic textual evidence that can be drawn only 
from a systematically microstructural reading .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> so just to put that into a simpler english , she's 
saying that the alternative is the revisionist    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('522')">0:08:42</a> scholars about the origins of the Quran ,
from Wansbrough , Crone , Cook , Lüling , Luxenberg .not    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('528')">0:08:48</a> only do they contradict each other  so they can't 
all be true any one of them in theory could be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532')">0:08:52</a> true but they rely on textual observations that 
are too selective, in other words they don't   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('538')">0:08:58</a> use a comprehensive wide basis of evidence , they 
have very selective and they pick on little things    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> and make big theories , they're not looking at 
a comprehensive as she says Quranic textual    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('551')">0:09:11</a> evidence , they're not looking at all the evidence. END QUOTE
So that's the passage there i just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('557')">0:09:17</a> read in pretty dense academic language .
But the conclusion i draw on this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> top expert who's not a muslim at the University of 
Berlin, expert on the Quran is that the traditional    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('573')">0:09:33</a> muslim story of the genesis of the Quran , in 
other words it was given to Muhammad during    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('579')">0:09:39</a> his own lifetime codified into one single
text if you like just after by Uthman (we all    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('588')">0:09:48</a> know the story) , this has not been successfully 
challenged by radical and skeptical scholars ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('596')">0:09:56</a> these radical skeptical scholars are now 
pretty much not accepted as having anything   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('603')">0:10:03</a> valid and to say any longer, their theories 
are discarded. Although some of the questions    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('608')">0:10:08</a> she says that they raise are still of interest, so 
there is that. But she herself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('614')">0:10:14</a> says the beginning of this passage i read 
that she relies, she assumes the genuineness    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('621')">0:10:21</a> of the Quranic text that we have today being the 
same text that goes back to Muhammad. So that's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('626')">0:10:26</a> her working hypothesis - it's not been successfully 
challenged by radical skeptic scholars. So there we   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('633')">0:10:33</a> have it, we have two very different 
views, we have the views of Christian missionaries    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('638')">0:10:38</a> who say we don't have a reliable text and we 
have the views of the experts , the scholars , the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643')">0:10:43</a> people whose who are professors in this 
subject who say the opposite. So i think that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('652')">0:10:52</a> i just find that very very interesting .
this book is worth getting actually  ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('656')">0:10:56</a> against a scholarly text, it's a very advanced 
text but it provides you with some real  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('661')">0:11:01</a> information about actual scholarly research 
rather than the perhaps the propaganda that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('667')">0:11:07</a> you'll come across from Christian websites 
and missionaries . Until next time
