[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=2) happened the this afternoon i had lunch  
[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=4) with a professor at one of istanbul's  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=7) leading  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=8) elite universities i can't say his name  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=10) or the subject he teaches but he did say  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=13) something very interesting he's noticed  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=15) in recent very recent times half his  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=18) female students now wear the hijab  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=21) and half don't and the half that don't  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=24) very often expose the midriff of their  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=28) tops  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=29) and this is something quite striking and  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=31) new this his emphasis on uh hijab  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=35) wearing by half of his female students  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=38) and as corresponding reaction seemingly  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=41) where half of his  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=43) other students don't wear hijab and  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=45) indeed exposed maximally a lot of flesh  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=48) so i thought that was very interesting  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=50) and it's a sign of the times in istanbul  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=53) and it's a new development and wonder  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/Nq9dkSVb8_s?t=55) what that means for the future
