In the passage found in Mark 10:17-19, a man comes to Jesus and asks what he needs to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus replies that only God is good, and the man is not good enough on his own. This would mean that Jesus is not good, but is the divine being himself.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0T5K1O5y4&t=0)** In the passage found in Mark 10:17-19, a man comes to Jesus and asks what he needs to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus replies that only God is good, and the man is not good enough on his own. In Matthew, the man comes up to Jesus and asks what good thing he needs to do. Jesus then says the same thing, but applies it to himself. This change makes nonsense of what Jesus replies, as it would mean that Jesus is not good, but is the divine being himself.

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=2) dr um dale martin who i've had the  
[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=3) privilege of speaking to him on several  
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=5) occasions i know he's a friend of yours  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=7) um  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=8) um has said in his view one of the most  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=10) securely historically reliable passages  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=12) in these synoptic gospels is the passage  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=14) found in mark 10 verses 17 18 and 19 a  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=18) man comes to jesus says good teacher  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=20) what must i do to inherit eternal life  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=22) jesus says why do you call me good  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=23) there's no one good but god alone obey  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=25) the commandments etcetera  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=27) and the reason seems to be that here we  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=29) have an apparent denial by jesus on the  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=31) lips of jesus in mark i know it's  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=33) slightly different in matthew um that he  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=35) is in any way identifying himself as god  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=38) or the divine being you know why do you  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=40) call me good there's no one good but god  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=42) alone now did you share uh if i can put  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=44) it in this personal way do you share  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=46) dale's uh  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=47) um the confidence that this is a a very  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=49) reliable  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=50) episode in the gospels  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=52) yeah we've had a number of arguments  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=54) about these verses  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=55) deal martin and i  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=60) we both agree that this this does look  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=61) like something that's historical that  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=63) jesus said right and it actually is  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=65) important that matthew changes it yes  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=67) because matthew changes it so jesus no  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=70) longer says what he says in mark  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=72) so in mark the man comes up and says a  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=75) good teacher what must i have for return  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=77) do for eternal life and why do you call  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=79) me good  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=80) god alone is good in matthew  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=83) you have the word good still but he puts  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=85) in a different place in matthew  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=90) matthew the man comes up to jesus and  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=92) says teacher  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=93) what good thing must i do for eternal  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=97) life so he is good but now it's not  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=98) applied to jesus it's applied to the  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=100) thing he has to do  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=101) and it ends up making nonsense of what  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=103) jesus replies because then jesus replies  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=106) why do you ask me about the good well  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=107) you're the messiah you should know about  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=109) these things  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=111) but in  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=112) in mark he does say this the argument  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=114) that dale martin and i have had about it  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=116) is what is jesus denying  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=118) he says why do you ask why do you call  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=120) me good god alone is good dale thinks  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=123) that's a denial that he's god and i  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=126) think he might he might be right about  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=127) that he i think that's a perfect that's  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=130) a very good way of reading it but  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=132) another way of reading is that he's  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=134) denying being good  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=136) why do you call me good  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=138) only god is good  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=140) so it might those two things might kind  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=142) of gel together  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=144) yeah um  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=145) i mean  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=146) there's a humble jew you know he's not  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=148) glorifying himself he he's saying that  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=150) why do you this word only really belongs  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=153) and it's true significance with god  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=154) himself he's being very humble doesn't  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=156) mean that he's a a terrible sinner or  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=157) he's saying oh i'm a bad person he's  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=159) just saying  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=160) use that language of god there may be  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=162) some spiritual pious motif there or  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=164) something  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=165) yeah  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=166) it could be and it's so but so i think  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=168) it might be a denial that he's god but  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=171) but it's not a it's not a uh  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=173) cut right case for for me  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=176) so if if um if jesus is not denying he's  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=179) god that what would be the motive in  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=180) matthew changing the words of jesus uh  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=183) then to remove that what's matthew  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=185) removing is it just the sense that jesus  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=186) is being denying he's good then i  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=188) suppose  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=189) yeah it's it's one or the other it's  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=191) either that matthew's  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=193) or both but uh but matthew doesn't like  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=195) the idea that jesus is somehow claiming  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=198) either not to be good or not to be god  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=200) or possibly both  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=202) and so uh so he changes it uh luke keeps  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=206) it uh but you know matthew had a problem  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/Ch0T5K1O5y4?t=208) with
