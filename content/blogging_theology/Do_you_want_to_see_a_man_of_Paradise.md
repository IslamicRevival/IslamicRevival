![alt Do you want to see a man of Paradise?](SPLd1iCHxd8.jpg "Do you want to see a man of Paradise?")

## Description

The Prophet once said to his companions: â€™Do you want to see a man of Paradise?'

A man then passed by, and the Prophet said, 'That man is of the people of Paradise.' One of companions of the Prophet wanted to find out what it was about this man that earned him such a commendation from the Messenger of God, so he decided to spend some time with this man and observe him closely. He noticed that this man did not perform the night prayer vigil or do anything extraordinary. He appeared to be an average man of Medina. The companion finally told the man what the prophet had said about him and asked if he did anything special. The man replied, 'The only thing that I can think of, other than what everybody else does, is that I make sure that I never sleep with any rancor in my heart towards another.'

That was his secret.

(Rancour is bitterness or resentfulness)
