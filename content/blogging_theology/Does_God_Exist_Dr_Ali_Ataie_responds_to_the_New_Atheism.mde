### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=0) - [00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=3000)

In this video, Dr. Ali Ataie discusses the arguments for and against the existence of God. He argues that atheists make illogical arguments based on false premises, and that religious and secular fundamentalism create violence and oppression. He provides evidence that points to the existence of God, based on moral arguments and the lack of evidence to support naturalism.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=0)** This video discusses the arguments for and against the existence of God, and provides examples of syllogisms. The Islamic scholar Dr. Ali Ataie discusses how the evidentialist approach to God relies on logic and reason, and how this approach can be used to prove the existence of God.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=300)** In this YouTube video, Dr. Ali Ataie discusses the two types of arguments that can be used to support the existence of God: logical arguments and non-sequitur arguments. He then goes on to discuss the arguments of four prominent atheists: Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett. Each of these atheists make arguments against God based on issues of social impact, morality, and logic. Ataie says that while these arguments are logical, their premises are axiomatically untrue and thus the arguments are illogical.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=600)** The video discusses the views of atheists and classical liberals regarding the existence of God. It argues that without a moral authority, humans would be unable to survive in a world withoutrules. Classical liberals believe that without religion, morality would be relatived and humans would become little more than beasts. Atheists are said to be material reductionists, which leads to the social impact of their views. The video goes on to discuss the views of Chairman Mao, Joseph Stalin, Paul Pot, and Adolf Hitler, arguing that without a belief in a god, they would have more blood on their hands than atheists.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=900)** In this video, Dr. Ali Ataie discusses why atheists believe that everything can be explained with one answer - Explanatory Monism - and how this simplistic way of thinking leads to false assumptions. He also discusses the false flag operations of Nero and the Gulf of Tonkin, and points to the example of a mother boiling water as an analogy for explaining complex phenomena. Finally, Dr. Ataie recommends the book God in the New Atheism by John Hot Huhta, which discusses the similarities between atheism and religion.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=1200)** Dr. Ali Ataie provides evidence that points to the existence of God, based on moral arguments and the lack of evidence to support naturalism. He also argues that religious and secular fundamentalism create violence and oppression.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=1500)** The video discusses the topic of whether or not God exists and how certain aspects of morality can be considered objective, regardless of whether or not a god exists. It points to examples from history and mythology to illustrate its points. Dr. Ali Ataie, a philosopher, responds to the New Atheism. He argues that atheism does not lead to a lack of morality, but rather to a different understanding of what morality is.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=1800)** The video discusses the cosmological argument, which states that because the universe began to exist, it must have a cause. The argument has theological implications, as it suggests that God exists. Some atheists criticize Mother Teresa for her supposed reliance on money and her lack of empathy for the poor, charges which she addresses in her book "The Missionary Position."
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=2100)** The philosopher Dr. Ali Ataie discusses the cosmological argument, which states that if the universe exists, then there must be a cause for it. He argues that this cause cannot be finite, since it would require progressing towards an endpoint, and that it must be eternal, since it would have had no beginning. He concludes that this cause must be God.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=2400)** The teleological argument is used to argue that there is design in the universe, due to the fine tuning of constants and variables. Anthony Flew, an atheist, changed his mind after studying the evidence and believing in a creator.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=2700)** Dr. Ali Ataie points out that if certain constants and quantities in the universe were not precisely fine-tuned for the existence of intelligent life, life would not exist in the universe. He also argues that the universe is not due to chance or physical necessity, but is instead due to design, specifically, the fine-tuning of complex constants and quantities with intelligence.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3cNUixEBM&t=3000)** This video features a debate between Ali Ataie, a professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, and the New Atheists, who argue that there is no evidence that God exists. Ataie argues that there is a very small chance that a life-permitting universe exists, and that this is more likely than the belief that God exists.

[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3) does god exist well according to prominent figures 
in the new atheist movement the answer is a    
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=10) resounding no and if you look at the the books 
and the the speeches and the youtube videos of    
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=17) people like richard dawkins sam harris christopher 
hitchens and daniel dennett you'll read lots of    
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=24) uh alleged reasons and arguments why god does not 
exist uh to give one example the uh the erstwhile    
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=31) british author who sadly passed away a few years 
ago christopher hitchens wrote this book god is    
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=37) not great and on the back cover he gives 
his reasons why god is not great makes the    
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=44) ultimate case against religion in a series 
of acute readings of the major religious    
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=50) texts christopher hitchens demonstrates 
the ways in which religion is man-made    
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=57) dangerously sexually repressive and 
distorts the very origins of the cosmos    
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=63) above all hitchins argues that the concept 
of an omniscient god has profoundly damaged    
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=70) humanity and proposes that the world might 
be a great deal better off without him    
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=78) now you'll be relieved to know i'm not going 
to be reading chunks of christopher hitchens    
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=82) book um what i'm going to do is uh share with you 
now a video by someone called professor alia tai    
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=91) and this is an extraordinary tour de force he 
looks at the arguments uh marshalled by the new    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=99) atheist movement particularly hitchens dawkins 
harris and dennett which led many people to    
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=104) question that their faith and he takes them 
apart deconstructs them and in extraordinary    
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=111) speech discussion he shows why not only they are 
wrong but why god definitely exists so the answer    
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=119) to the question is yes so i've got permission uh 
from dr alia tai to share this video with with you    
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=126) um and i think it's one of the most extraordinary 
uh presentations of uh the arguments for the    
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=132) existence of god from a muslim perspective as 
well as an analysis of the claims of the new    
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=140) atheists so without more ado i hand over to dr 
ali atai until next time so the uh objective    
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=151) tonight is to answer the question does god 
exist the answer is yes thank you good night  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=162) just kidding okay here we go so there's two 
approaches to the god question the first approach    
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=170) is called presuppositionalism presuppositionalism 
so this deals with revealed theology which happens    
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=176) to be my specialty by the way comparative 
theology this is where we presuppose    
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=181) the existence of god so god exists but we 
seek to know him more personally we seek to    
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=187) have marifa more gnosis or episteme whichever word 
you like of allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala this is done    
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=193) through revelation so like a muslim and christian 
debate right what's a muslim and christian going    
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=199) to debate about they're not going to debate 
about does god exist they both presuppose    
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=203) the existence of god god does exist right and most 
would say they worship the same god so the answer    
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=210) to the the topic of that type of debate is how 
does the how does this god reveal himself does    
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=215) he reveal himself through jesus christ through 
the bible through the new testament or does god    
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=221) reveal himself through the quran and the prophecy 
given to our master muhammad sallallahu alaihi    
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=226) is jesus god this is another topic that will be 
discussed at that type of debate so that's one    
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=233) approach to god the presuppositionalist 
approach another approach to god is the    
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=238) evidentialist approach the evidentialist approach 
evidentialism so here we're looking for evidence    
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=245) for the existence of god and we're going 
to use logic we're going to use reason    
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=249) philosophy and science we're going to 
employ deductive or syllogistic arguments    
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=255) that are not strictly theological but may 
have strong theological implications so here    
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=260) the muslim and the christian will actually join 
forces right in order to find evidence or provide    
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=266) evidence for the atheist that god exists so 
tonight i'm going to be looking primarily    
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=270) at the latter approach the evidentialist approach 
so we're going to put the polemics on hold a    
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=275) little bit and give our christian friends 
a little rest inshallah to allah tonight    
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=279) okay so let's look at examples of of syllogisms 
this is a form of argument that is attributed to    
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=286) aristotle aristotle said there are three things 
that affect the strength of an argument he called    
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=291) them lagos ethos and pathos in greek lagos means 
logic right knowledge the knowledge of an argument    
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=300) and then he said ethos the strength of the 
character of the one making the argument    
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=305) right so someone like in hadith we have looking at 
the acumen of people in the senate of a hadith is    
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=311) very important for them to have high religiosity 
right and then he said pathos pathos means that    
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=319) you know how you read something read 
a response this is listener response    
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=322) is that person making that argument does he 
affect the audience does he affect them is it    
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=327) transformative right oftentimes what we find with 
atheists is they don't have knowledge of the topic    
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=335) they don't have good character because a lot of 
the things that they say is ad hominem attacks    
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=339) but they have a lot of pathos they have a lot of 
charisma they're good speakers and i'm thinking    
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=344) about someone like christopher hitchens we'll 
get back to him inshaallah so give you an example    
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=349) of a syllogistic argument very simple premise 
number one all men or mortal all men are mortal    
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=358) okay everyone following premise 
number two george washington was a man    
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=364) therefore our conclusion which is inescapable and 
it follows logically is that george washington    
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=371) was a mortal right so our two premises all 
men are mortal george washington was a man    
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=377) is solid is self-evident you can call 
it axiomatic any sincere or sane person    
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=384) will concede these premises right unless 
somebody says well george washington was a jinn    
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=390) well generous or mortal he was a vampire he can't 
die right a sane or sincere person will say this    
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=396) is a logical argument no problems let's look at 
a different type of argument premise number one    
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=402) the universe is ordered premise number two this is 
either by chance or by design premise number three    
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=410) this is not by chance therefore our conclusion our 
inescapable conclusion is that this is by design    
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=419) this is a logical argument however you might 
say my first premise the universe is ordered    
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=426) is not self-evident i haven't proven that so 
this is an example of what's known as a question    
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=430) begging argument right i haven't established my 
premises right i have to do that first also you    
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=437) can have an argument that flows logically but 
whose premises are axiomatically false they're    
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=444) irrational for example premise number one all 
donkeys can speak english premise number two    
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=451) gary is my pet donkey therefore my conclusion 
is gary can speak english the logical argument    
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=458) but the argument is axiomatically untrue now if 
you look at the arguments of the four horsemen of    
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=465) the new atheist movement who are the four horsemen 
christopher hitchens richard dawkins sam harris    
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=473) and daniel dennett right best-selling books god 
is not great the god delusion and end of faith    
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=480) they're arguments against god they primarily 
revolve around issues of social impact of    
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=487) religion so religious people are bad so god does 
not exist see look at hitler he was a catholic    
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=495) look at these pedophile priests look at suicide 
bombers look at isis right god doesn't exist    
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=503) so if we put their argument into a syllogism it 
would sound something like this premise number    
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=508) one theists say god is good premise number 
two god created man premise number three man    
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=516) does evil man does none good therefore god does 
not exist this argument is illogical illogical    
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=526) this is an example of what's known as a 
non-sequitur argument it does not follow so you    
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=532) have people like bill maher and sam harris right 
they go on tv they're talking about isis right    
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=539) and they say well you know isis by the way a few 
thousand people out of a religion of 1.5 billion    
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=545) right and you say you have isis and they're 
violent thus islam is violent i can use the same    
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=550) type of argument and say look five of the last 12 
nobel peace laureates five of the last 12 nobel    
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=559) peace laureates were muslim right therefore all 
muslims are peaceful would he accept this argument    
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=565) would they accept this argument certainly they 
wouldn't i can make another argument a little more    
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=569) brazen say look sam harris his mother is jewish 
that makes him ethnically jewish in atheists    
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=575) but ethnically jewish bill maher his mother is 
jewish that makes him ethnically jewish therefore    
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=580) all ethnic jews are bigoted and full of hate would 
they accept this argument of course they wouldn't    
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=586) accept this argument you see these four horsemen 
as i call them they think if you turn all of the    
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=592) mosques the synagogues and churches into starbucks 
chuck e cheese and hooters we can just sort of all    
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=599) hold hands and sing imagine by john lennon right 
and no religion too right interesting john lennon    
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=608) a satanist have you seen the uh the cover of 
the sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band    
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=614) all these people look in the upper left alistar 
crowley the founder of the church of satan look    
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=619) it up don't take my word for it anyway the 
classical atheists the original gangsters    
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=625) of atheism freud russell and nietzsche nietzsche 
who said god is dead freud who said god is dead    
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=634) right they at least were smart enough to know 
that if you take religion out of the equation    
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=641) the world would fall into this nihilistic quagmire 
you would have utter social and moral depravity    
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=647) they understood that it was primarily religion 
that moralized people and that the purpose of    
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=652) religion was to make one better more compassionate 
human being as voltaire said if god did not exist    
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=657) we would have to invent him as dostoyevsky said 
if there is no god then everything is permitted    
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=664) in other words if you don't have any moral 
authority then what's your moral anchor    
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=668) survival of the fittest do it thou wilt do you 
know what the moral anchor is in the abrahamic    
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=674) tradition rabbi akiva a second century rabbinical 
sage was asked what is the torah he recited

tradition he said al-islam what is islam  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=780) is to worship the creator and show mercy 
towards his creation now without this essential    
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=785) understanding of religion without religion 
morality becomes relative human beings become    
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=792) little more than cattle chunks of flesh and 
blood soulless easily slaughtered dispensable    
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=800) atheists are material reductionists thus 
speaking of social impact no one has more    
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=807) blood on their hands than atheists let's talk 
about the big four as i call them chairman mao    
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=814) joseph stalin paul pot mussolini over 100 million 
lives 100 million hitler was a catholic no doubt    
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=824) about it he killed six million jews i've done the 
math those men are 17 hitler's 17 times over why    
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=831) no god no day of judgment no incorruptible soul 
survival of the fittest that's natural selection    
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=840) in sharia we have rules of engagement in islamic 
sacred law women and children are not targeted    
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=846) this is considered to be tawatur it is simply 
wrong even abdullah ibn kamiyah the man who killed    
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=851) musa and he thought he was the prophet salallahu 
sallam when he realized this is not the prophet    
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=859) and he saw the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam 
he charged towards the prophet with his horse    
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=863) a woman stood in front of him nusaiba bintukab 
radhillahu and he stopped dead in his tracks    
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=870) a pagan arab has the decency not to 
strike a woman on the battlefield    
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=875) but you find these secular societies in the 
world so-called first world that are dropping    
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=880) two thousand pound bombs on innocent men women 
and children subhanallah so if your rules of    
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=888) engagement are determined by what you feel 
benefits you and your people at a particular time    
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=897) that's real politics right that's american foreign 
policy atheism and secular democracy they lack    
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=904) principled morality it gives birth to false flag 
operations like nero you know the emperor nero    
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=911) he set fire to his own city rome and then he sat 
back playing on his fiddle as the city was burning    
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=917) and he blamed the christians and then he would 
dip christians in the hot wax put them on stakes    
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=922) and use them as street lamps this is nero right 
uss maine give you a more contemporary example    
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=930) scientifically proven that this explosion came 
from inside the uss maine itself scientifically    
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=935) proven a total study was done on this in 2002 
remember the main to hell with spain this is what    
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=941) got us into the spanish-american war and this 
is how america took control of the philippines    
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=946) the false flag operation the gulf of tonkin never 
happened lyndon johnson goes on tv and he says    
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=953) our boys are floating in the water end quote no 
they weren't total lie that's what got us in the    
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=960) vietnam sixty thousand americans killed over three 
million vietnamese lack of principled morality    
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=968) right leads to little boy and fat man you know 
who little boy and fat men are these are the names    
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=974) that truman gave the atomic bombs that killed 
300 000 people on impact 300 000 people that's    
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=981) three football stadiums that's four football 
stadiums you know how many people died in all    
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=985) of the ghazalat of the prophet sallam in 23 years 
they've done the math he's done the math how many    
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=992) people muslim and non-muslim and all the military 
expeditions of the prophet salallahu salaam 1018  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=999) 1018 about 700 mushrikeen 300 muslims 
you have 300 000 people on impact    
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1006) hey that's good for us totally unnecessary the 
japanese economy was in shambles there was an    
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1011) oil embargo placed on them by fdr years before 
there's no way they're going to win the war    
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1016) but we have human guinea pigs real 
politic lack of principled morality  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1023) okay invasions of false countries invasions 
of countries under false pretenses the theft    
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1028) of natural resources in 2006 i read an article 
washington post it said 650 000 civilians in    
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1037) iraq have been killed in october of 2006 because 
this country was invaded under false pretenses    
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1044) 650 000 that number is well well into the 
millions that's called the genocide you know    
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1050) interestingly the quran does not accept atheism 
it doesn't accept it everyone worships something    
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1056) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala 
says have you seen the one ara  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1061) have you seen the one who takes his his 
hawa his caprice as his god people worship    
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1067) themselves they're called beliebers you know 
what a believer is right how many believers    
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1073) do i have out here hopefully no one here is a 
belieber a follower of justin bieber that's what    
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1077) he calls them god complex one of my teachers 
said everyone has in their heart the seeds    
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1083) laying dormant ready to be watered if need be 
ready to be watered the claim of the firaoun    
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1091) i am your lord the most high laying dormant in 
the heart of every person people worship money    
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1098) ben franklin people worship their achal there's 
a good book recommendation here comes the first    
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1103) book recommendation it's called god in the new 
atheism by john hot h-a-u-g-h-t h-a-u-g-h-t he's    
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1111) a jesuit he's a christian he's a catholic makes 
a good point he says atheists believe everything    
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1116) can be explained with one answer he calls it 
explanatory monism right all you need is the    
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1122) intellect the intellect can answer everything just 
use your intellect you can figure everything out    
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1128) very simplistic way this is their method 
says look what if your mother is uh boiling    
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1133) water one day and you walk into the kitchen see 
what are you doing she says i'm boiling water    
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1138) see that's great but what are you 
doing i'm separating molecules    
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1145) beautiful but what are you doing i'm making 
tea why for you why because i love you    
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1152) right this is what you can't get from science this 
is what you can't get from atheism why why the    
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1158) universe it's interesting uh uh william chidik 
uses this in his book he says look a scientist    
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1164) put him in front of the mona lisa tell them tell 
me about this painting so scientists will you know    
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1171) do radio carbon 14 dating on the canvas he'll 
say that this paint is from florence from 1585    
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1176) whatever he's going to do all this information a 
lot of information great but then put a child in    
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1181) front of that painting and the child is thinking 
what is the artist what is what does the smile    
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1185) mean what is the artist trying to tell me who 
has more insight into the mind of the painter    
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1191) the scientist or the child the child because the 
child is asking the more profound question of    
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1196) why dr lawrence krauss atheist cosmologist 
arizona state university says we can date the    
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1203) universe to four decimal places 13.72 billion 
years that's great but why why the universe    
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1211) this is something you get from revelation 
this is something you get from scripture    
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1217) read chris hedges three more book 
recommendations american fascism    
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1221) great book number two i don't believe in atheists 
number three when atheism becomes religion    
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1228) here's a preview from amazon hedges claims that 
those who have placed blind faith in the morally    
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1234) neutral disciplines morally neutral disciplines of 
reason and science create idols in their own image    
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1241) a sin for either side of the spectrum he makes a 
case against religious and secular fundamentalism    
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1247) which seeks to divide the world into those worthy 
of moral and intellectual consideration and those    
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1252) who should be condemned silenced and eradicated 
he uh characterizes the new atheists as those who    
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1259) attack religion to advance the worst of global 
capitalism intolerance and imperial projects    
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1267) okay and this leads me to my first argument to the 
existence of god this is called the moral argument    
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1274) for the existence of god here's the thesis in the 
absence of god there would be no objective moral    
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1281) values no higher moral authority there would be 
socio-cultural relativism right and wrong would    
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1289) be determined by a dominant group there would 
be it would be totally subjective and that is    
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1294) violent if my society feels that our morals and 
values perpetuate our group why should we consider    
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1301) your morals and values let me quote to you 
richard dawkins quote there is no good nor evil    
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1308) there is no good nor evil we are machines to 
propagate dna on atheism you cannot be immoral    
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1318) you cannot be immoral there is no real with a 
capital r right or wrong just a societal construct    
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1325) science can't prove morality you can't prove to 
me that murder is wrong through the scientific    
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1331) method you can't prove morality the religion 
of scientism if you want to call it that where    
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1335) the aqua the intellect is worshiped cannot 
prove certain things thank you very much    
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1341) like morality science can't prove metaphysical 
events can science prove that washington crossed    
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1346) the delaware no not through the scientific method 
why because you can't reproduce that event it's    
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1352) in the past science can't prove love emotions 
science can't prove math it presupposes math    
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1359) if you say science proves math then you argue in 
a circle science doesn't know what consciousness    
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1364) is what is consciousness uh chemicals mixing in 
your brain but what is memory what is thought    
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1370) what is what is imagination there are no answer 
for these things these are metaphysical science    
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1375) can't prove everything so we have to move past 
explanatory monism science cannot give us morality    
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1383) it is fundamentally non-moral i'm 
not saying atheists are immoral    
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1387) don't get the wrong idea there are many atheists 
that are very very moral but there's nothing in    
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1391) science that compels anyone to be moral let 
me say it again there is nothing in science    
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1398) that compels anyone to be moral you can't 
extract charity and justice and selflessness    
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1407) and compassion from a double helix 
from a chromosome from a test tube  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1413) those things are extracted from scripture 
on atheism we're all just animals a slightly    
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1420) more evolved primate second cousin to the chimp 
animals don't have moral duties so why should we    
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1428) most atheists would actually concede that we have 
moral duties if you're sitting on a beach and    
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1432) there's a kid drowning it's your moral obligation 
to try to save that kid but why why put yourself    
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1438) in harm's way did we evolve to put ourselves in 
harm's way where does this altruism come from    
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1444) show me the gene speaking of evolution to go from 
a primeval ape to a human being takes trillions    
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1454) of transitional forms trillions of mutations in 
transitional forms to go from a dinosaur to a bird    
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1461) a whale to a cow right trillions it's interesting 
darwin in the origin of species in 1863 says we're    
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1468) going to find them eventually we're going to 
dig up the earth we're going to find all these    
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1471) trillions of transitional forms from ape to human 
being what have we found what does the fossil    
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1477) record show trillions no billions no millions yeah 
no thousands no hundreds come on 100 no a dozen no    
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1490) six or seven maybe and they're probably extinct 
apes that they say oh these are the missing    
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1496) these are the trillions of transitional forms okay 
interesting and here's something more interesting    
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1502) called darwin's doubt darwin actually said if i 
believe that my brain actually came from monkeys    
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1507) why should i even trust my brain in the first 
place why should i trust my intellect how do i    
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1513) know that in a thousand years my ancestors aren't 
going to look back at me and say look how stupid    
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1518) those homo sapiens were in 2014 look what they 
thought just like we look at apes today in the zoo    
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1523) who are taking fleas out of their heads and 
flinging their feces at the window that's how    
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1527) they're going to be looking at us right why should 
i even trust my intellect if it came from a monkey  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1535) and they say well 98 of our 
dna is the same as a chimpanzee    
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1539) we have 98 identical dna well there's a two 
percent difference and in that two percent    
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1544) there's something called intellectus there's 
something called intellect this is our differentia    
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1549) according to aristotle this is what makes 
this difference this is the meaning of allah  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1556) that god created man in his own image meaning with    
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1560) intellect this is what makes us different not 
unnecessary not necessarily our physical bodies    
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1564) an eagle can spot a fish under water i can't do 
that put me in a room with a gorilla i'm done    
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1570) but i want to see a chimpanzee play a violin 
build a skyscraper do some trigonometry but    
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1577) it's not all about the intellect it's about 
being a moral person an ethical person  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1594) you dominate magnificent character this is a 
true human being this is a civilized human being    
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1601) good and evil has no referent if god doesn't 
exist unless we redefine good and say that it's    
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1607) something that makes your life more pleasurable 
that's what good is and of course this is    
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1612) dangerous your pleasure might be somebody's 
torture right what if you take pleasure from    
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1617) killing children and burying them in your backyard 
on atheism that's not immoral because atheism    
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1624) science does not deal with morality that's not 
immoral that's not wrong that's just not socially    
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1629) acceptable like breaking wind in public but what 
if it was socially acceptable not breaking in    
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1635) public killing children and burying them what 
if it was socially acceptable on what grounds    
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1640) does richard dawkins condemn child exploitation 
or rape if that society finds it acceptable    
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1647) and conducive to their perpetuation on what 
grounds can he say this is morally wrong  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1656) it's revelation that gives us the ten 
commandments the noahidic laws moral imperatives    
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1664) means things that are known whether you believe 
they come from revelation directly or whether    
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1668) they're infused to use aquinas's term upon our 
very souls we just know them they're on our souls    
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1675) something the atheist denies the existence of we 
have objective moral values don't murder don't    
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1681) steal don't commit adultery respect your parents 
don't oppress speak the truth let's go back to    
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1689) ancient athens where petersey was commonplace 
peterst if you don't know what it is look it up    
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1695) socrates walked into the gymnasium you know what 
gymnasium means in greek a place of naked boys and    
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1700) he bragged i walked in they were wrestling they 
were oiled up i wasn't even aroused this is what    
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1706) he says this is ethos for the ancient uh athenians 
right this is their ethics this is their culture    
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1713) simply what the majority was doing but in sparta 
another greek city-state if you do that they're    
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1719) going to kill you that's a capital offense if a 
jew walked into athens at that time a jew he could    
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1725) condemn it because he has moral uh principled 
objective morality because he has a scripture    
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1731) but an atheist could say well that's their culture 
they rape children that's their culture or he can    
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1737) say no this is wrong and then we press the 
atheist how is it wrong it's just wrong why    
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1745) who told you that it's just wrong why 
show me the gene show me the test tube    
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1752) where does he get his morality from not from a 
test tube they say you know we have the problem    
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1757) of evil theists believers in god they have the 
problem of evil theodicy atheists have the problem    
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1763) of good this is what william dempsky calls it the 
problem of good because dawkins says every single    
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1771) human interaction is because they want to prolong 
their species or they want reciprocal advantage    
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1776) i scratch your back you're going to scratch 
mine because at the end of the day we're all    
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1780) apes direct quote from richard dawkins planet of 
the apes all right so give a simple example why    
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1788) would i offer my seat to an old woman on the train 
do i want to prolong my species do i want her to    
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1796) tip me or something give me give me a dollar do i 
want something from her take advantage of her no    
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1802) why would i give blood to people and no one's 
around to see it just anonymous i donate blood why    
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1808) would i do that is this how i evolve am i trying 
to perpetuate my species am i trying to uh get    
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1814) some sort of mutual advantage from somebody that's 
why mother teresa is an atheistic moral enigma    
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1820) for the atheist hugging lepers right a model 
of sacrifice charity and altruism and that's    
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1826) why they went after her that's why hitchens has 
this book that he says she was all about money he    
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1830) calls it with apologies the missionary position 
that's the name of his book about mother teresa    
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1836) she's all about money because she's 
an enigma someone who's selfless    
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1840) that goes against what we've been teaching why 
would someone evolve to be like that very strange    
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1846) so that's the moral argument let that one marinate 
for a little bit let's move to another argument    
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1852) it's called the cosmological argument this is an 
argument that's espoused by a muhammad al-ghazali    
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1858) into philosophy it's advocated by william lane 
craig a modern proponent he wrote a book called    
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1864) the kalam cosmological argument it's another book 
i recommend for you kalam chasmologic cosmological    
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1870) argument so here's the argument premise number 
one whatever begins to exist has a cause    
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1876) premise number two the universe began to exist 
therefore the universe has a cause now this is    
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1883) not strictly theological but has theological 
implications i'll say it again premise    
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1887) number one whatever begins to exist as a cause 
premise number two the universe began to exist    
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1894) premise number three the universe has a cause 
right what can cause a universe now there's a    
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1899) rule in classical metaphysics ex nihilo nihil 
feet which means from nothing comes nothing from    
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1907) nothing comes nothing right now most atheists 
whether they're cosmologists or physicists    
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1912) or biologists like richard dawkins lawrence krauss 
stephen hawking quentin smith daniel dennett roger    
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1919) penrose they say that the universe the cosmos came 
from nothing this is true we believe in creatio    
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1927) x nailo creation from nothing allah subhanahu wa 
ta'ala created from nothing god caused it but they    
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1934) say it's uncaused that the universe is uncaused 
from nothing unprovoked it popped into existence    
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1942) from literary nowhere from nowhere uncaused 
quentin smith university of western michigan  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1952) he says he's atheist the universe came 
from nothing by nothing for nothing let's    
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1961) say it again the universe came from nothing buy 
nothing for nothing that's a metaphysical claim    
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1969) that's a metaphysical claim that's not 
a naturalist claim that's a metaphysical    
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1974) claim daniel dennett he said it's like the 
universe picked itself up by its bootstraps    
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1980) can you pick yourself up by your bootstraps 
if you did that i would say this it's    
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1986) a miracle this is a break of natural law 
it's a miracle it's a metaphysical claim    
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1991) right very interesting how can 
something come from nothing uncaused    
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=1996) is that science theist frank turek he 
said he wrote a book called i don't have    
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2001) enough faith to be an atheist believing 
that something can come from nothing    
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2006) is worse than magic said pull a rabbit out of my 
hat right that's going from something to something    
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2014) but to take a universe out of nothing is a big 
supernatural metaphysical claim stephen hawking    
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2022) says the universe can spontaneously create 
itself out of nothing that's not naturalism    
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2029) that's a supra rational statement that's a 
religious statement what is nothing nothing is    
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2036) what stones dream about this is aristotle what 
do stones dream about nothing that's nothing    
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2044) not simply empty space you know i do this trick 
with my kids i say is there anything in my hands  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2052) they say no and i go up there's something 
there right but even if i go like this    
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2059) there's nothing there but is there really 
nothing there near that show let's make a deal    
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2064) would you like door number one or door number 
two door number one they open it oh it's nothing    
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2068) is that what i'm talking about when i say nothing 
no nothing is the absolute absence of being    
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2075) right so stephen hawking says this this is 
what he used to say he says at the subatomic    
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2081) level the subatomic level in the quantum vacuum 
right quantum physics nobody really understands    
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2088) quantum physics in the quantum vacuum you have 
a proton that comes in and out of existence and    
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2096) he says this is something from nothing a proton 
coming in and out of existence the light quantum    
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2102) the photon right the problem with this is that the 
quantum vacuum is certainly not nothing it's a sea    
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2109) of fluctuating energy it's highly volatile it's 
very unstable now the latest from hawking is this    
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2117) he says if you extrapolate the universe 
backwards right because the universe is expanding    
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2123) isotropically it's expanding evenly isotropically 
we know this from uh recent discoveries 1929 the    
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2131) red shift of of galaxies called hubble's law right 
that universes are running away from each other    
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2137) if they were coming closer it would be blue but 
it's red on the spectrum right according to the    
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2142) doppler effect microwave background radiation 
was discovered in 1965 by penzias and wilson    
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2149) the afterglow of the big bang so this is called 
the hardel hawking standard model sometimes it's    
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2154) called the friedmann la montre standard model 
big bang cosmology right so stephen hawking is    
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2160) saying if you extrapolate the universe backwards 
backwards you come to a point of singularity    
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2167) okay no problem point of singularity but then 
he says what is this point of singularity it    
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2172) is an infinitesimally small black hole a small 
infinitesimally small black hole you see this    
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2179) is how he sidesteps infinite regression because 
in a black hole there's no time there's no time    
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2186) you know infinite regression what came first the 
chicken or the egg uh the egg where the chicken    
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2191) laid the egg uh the chicken the chicken came 
out of an egg an egg the chicken laid an egg    
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2197) i don't know right how do you 
get out of infinite regression    
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2202) no time in this black hole the problem with 
this is that a black hole is the resulting state    
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2208) of a solar explosion it's not an initial 
condition it is matter and matter requires motion    
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2217) and motion requires time so we might ask 
what is before the black hole the black hole    
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2223) is certainly not nothing it is something 
where did the singularity come from now    
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2228) uh lawrence krauss he wrote a book called a 
universe out of nothing arizona state four    
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2233) more cosmologists atheist he says like i said the 
universe is 13.7256 billion years old this nexus    
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2241) known as space-time the space-time continuum it 
came into being at the big bang in fact space-time    
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2248) and matter came into being right this is called 
cosmogenesis but how did it do it by itself    
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2257) it created itself this is a faith claim this 
is a metaphysical claim what if i told you i    
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2264) created myself i'm making a supernatural 
claim about myself this is what they're    
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2270) saying about the universe you see the only way to 
avoid infinite regress is to go metaphysical is to    
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2277) go supernatural is to ultimately go theological 
so here's my conclusions about the cosmological    
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2282) argument only a non-contingent being in other 
words one who is not subject to causality one who    
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2289) is not subject to infinite regress because he is 
eternal also the one who is necessarily spaceless    
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2297) timeless and immaterial because he created space 
time and matter he's also extremely powerful and    
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2303) extremely intelligent he created a universe 
can bring a universe into being from nothing    
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2310) but then they'll say well who caused god who 
caused god right it's god's very nature to be    
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2317) pre-eternal remember the first premise whatever 
begins to exist has a cause god never began    
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2323) to exist if we start asking that question then 
we question the very existence of the universe    
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2330) why let's say i'm standing in a line 
and there's a brother in front of me    
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2334) and i tell the brother i really want to give you 
a hug and the brother says ask the guy behind you    
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2340) say hey can i give him a hug he says ask the guy 
behind me hey can i give him a hug he says ask the    
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2346) guy behind me hey can i give him a hug ask the guy 
behind me and this goes on ad infinitum right add    
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2354) infinitum me giving the guy a hug represents the 
big bang the universe will i ever give him a hug    
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2362) no because you cannot traverse an actual 
infinitude you cannot traverse an actual    
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2369) infinitude if you ask a question who created 
god then you haven't solved infinite regression    
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2376) what is an actual infinitude in mathematics it's 
represented by the hebrew aleph the hebrew alif    
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2385) what is an actual infinitude a number that 
transcends and contains all natural numbers    
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2391) and cannot be increased why one by one an 
actual infinitude cannot be found in nature    
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2398) and abu yusuf al-kindi has a certain analogy he 
uses xeno has one zeno's paradox achilles and    
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2404) the tortoise hilbert's hotel mathematicians have 
different uh analogies they use to demonstrate    
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2410) the impossibility of having an actual infinitude 
in nature we have a theoretical infinitude also    
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2418) which is the lazy eight right a 
theoretical infinitude can be traversed    
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2425) within finite space we do it all the time i'll say 
it again a theoretical infinitude can be traversed    
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2434) within finite space my hand is above the table 
how many times can i cut this distance in half in    
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2441) theory an infinite number of times half half half 
half will i ever get to an actual infinitude no i    
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2449) won't go get to an actual infinitude because you 
can never get to an actual infinitude by adding    
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2455) uh successive numbers together finite numbers 
together so to ask this question who caused    
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2461) god another god who caused him another god who 
caused him another god this doesn't get us past    
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2466) infinite regression because we have a universe 
an actual infinitude cannot be traversed right  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2475) so if it's if the universe is eternal then in the 
past with god's creating gods creating gods and    
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2482) then the universe how did we get to today because 
we can't traverse an actual infinitude and get to    
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2488) today but we are here today so infinite regression 
dies at the door of the eternal this is the only    
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2496) way one can deal with infinite regression is 
a supernatural postulation metaphysical answer    
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2505) interestingly allah wa ta'ala 
the verses in the quran    
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2509) in which allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is described as  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2514) to split apart to break something apart  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2520) means to originate something 
the primal cause of something    
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2524) allah is the primal cause god 
created the universe out of nothing  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2535) that is your lord there is no 
god but he he's your creator of    
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2538) everything space time matter energy all of 
these created by allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2547) okay last argument it's called the teleological 
argument and then we'll open it up for questions    
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2554) and comments inshallah so this argument has uh it 
was used by aristotle and plato the teleological    
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2561) argument it's the most challenging according to 
hitchens for the atheists there's two versions    
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2566) of it the first version is the traditional 
argument which argues for biological complexity    
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2572) look at the human eye look at the human brain 
look at the systems within the human being    
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2577) you know architects looked at the at insects 
when they wanted to build the eiffel tower    
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2584) people looked at the wings of birds 
when they wanted to build airplanes    
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2588) anthony flew who was 50 years an atheist 
at cambridge university suddenly came to    
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2594) believe in god after 50 years he debated 
c.s lewis and suddenly he said you know    
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2599) the human cell that's not chance and that's not 
evolution that's design and now i believe in god    
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2606) he's a deist he's not a christian he's not a 
muslim he's on a jew but he believes in god    
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2611) interestingly the two greatest scientists of 
all time were unitarian deists sir isaac newton    
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2619) albert einstein these people believe in god 
not believing in god was out of the question    
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2625) now there's another type of theological argument 
this is for the cutting edge version of it and    
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2630) this argues for cosmic design due to fine tuning 
so you know the watchmaker analogy this is first    
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2638) used by william paley in 1802 right dates back to 
cicero walking on the beach you find a watch you    
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2645) pick it up you notice it's craftsmanship 
so what can you conclude that this just    
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2650) formed itself by chance atoms came together and 
made this incredible little watch right well let's    
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2657) say that you're an astronaut and you're on the 
dark side of the moon and you find a transformer    
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2662) they made a movie about this right so you have 
three options why is that there number one out    
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2667) of necessity does it have to be there no the moon 
functions without the transformer is it chance    
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2675) so these atoms they just happen to form this 
incredible piece of machinery there's a chance but    
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2681) probably not right or it's designed even if you 
don't know who put it there the best explanation    
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2688) is that it was designed you don't have to have an 
explanation for the best explanation but you know    
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2692) it's designed right so look at the earth itself 
the distance from the moon and sun if you're a    
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2698) little bit closer a little bit farther there's no 
life on planet earth if the days were a little bit    
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2703) longer life would cease to exist on earth if the 
access of the earth 23.5 degrees was slightly off    
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2709) there would be no life on earth if the atmosphere 
changed a little bit solar flares would swallow us    
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2716) up we would burn to a crisp there'd be no life on 
earth jupiter isn't a perfect place with perfect    
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2722) mass it's a it's a solar cosmic vacuum cleaner 
all of these asteroids and comets that come to    
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2729) earth they're pulled towards jupiter and it saves 
us subhanallah the solar system itself is like a    
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2736) watch you know sir isaac newton he noticed that 
the planets they orbit around the sun in the same    
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2742) direction and they're on the same plane and he 
said this is design now the atheist will say oh    
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2748) that's what the theist does whenever he doesn't 
understand something he puts god in the gap    
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2754) to god of the gaps whenever a theist a believer 
doesn't understand something he says oh that's god    
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2759) god of the gaps but we understand how a watch 
works it doesn't negate its designer we understand    
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2766) how the solar system works now it doesn't negate 
it's been designed so that argument doesn't work    
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2771) now almost all atheists conclude that the 
universe is fine-tuned for the existence of    
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2777) intelligent life and fine-tuned is a neutral term 
it's not strictly theological how is it fine-tuned    
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2784) you see there are certain constants and 
quantities constants and quantities of the    
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2790) four fundamental forces of nature that have 
to fall within an incredibly narrow range    
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2796) what are the four fundamental forces of nature 
gravity electromagnetism weak nuclear force    
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2802) strong nuclear force all of them and the point of 
singularity so let's look we'll come back to this    
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2807) idea let's look at our syllogism uh premise 
number one the fine tuning of the universe    
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2813) is due to either physical necessity which 
almost all atheists reject because you can    
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2820) have a universe with different concepts 
and quantities and you'll have a universe    
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2825) or it's chance and that's what atheists 
say yes it's chance or it's by design    
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2832) premise number two it's not due to physical 
necessity or chance therefore it is due to design    
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2839) and by design we mean a specified complexity 
specified created tailored with unimaginable    
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2847) intelligence in pinpoint exquisite precision we'll 
let you know how that is william lane craig he    
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2854) says there are 50 such constants and quantities 
present in the big bang that must be fine-tuned    
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2861) in this way and their ratios to one another must 
also be fine-tuned to allow for life-permitting    
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2868) universe the numbers become incomprehensible 
i'll give you some examples just to give you    
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2872) an idea of the numbers the number of seconds in 
the history of the universe is 10 to the 17th the    
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2879) number of seconds in the history of the universe 
is 10 to the 17th 10 with 17 zeros after it the    
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2886) number of subatomic particles in the universe 
according to william dempsky is 10 to the 80.    
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2893) okay now atomic weak force 
operates in the nucleus of an atom    
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2897) an alteration of one part out of out 
of ten to the one hundredth one part    
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2904) out of ten to the one hundredth would render 
life unsustained unsustainable in the universe    
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2911) this is the incredible precision of the universe 
so let me put that in perspective for you let's    
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2917) say i have a dart i have a single dart and 
in front of me there are a number of people    
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2921) 10 to the 100th which is impossible right that's 
a lot of people let's say they're standing in    
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2925) front of me one of them has a target on his 
chest i throw the dart and it hits a target    
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2932) that's just one of these fundamental forces that 
have to line up if gravity was changed by one    
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2939) part out of 10 to the 40th there is no life in the 
universe the atheists say this is just chance we    
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2946) got lucky the constants and quantities fell within 
this very very very small life permitting range    
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2952) let me give you another analogy the lottery 
analogy let's say that i have a huge cosmic hat    
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2958) a huge cosmic hat and i have 10 to the 40 number 
of white balls that i put into this cosmic hat    
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2966) i give you one of these balls these white 
balls and you write your initials on it    
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2970) and i say okay i'm gonna put this back into the 
hat okay then i'm gonna draw out a ball at random    
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2978) if it's a white ball without your initials nothing 
happens nothing happens but if we draw out the    
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2984) ball with your initials we kill you right you 
think i'm feeling a little saucy let's do it what    
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=2992) does 10 to the 40th 10 with 40 zeros impossible go 
ahead do it ah look what's your initial reaction  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3003) it was rigged that was rigged you 
fooled me it was designed right    
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3010) look at the cosmic landscape possible universes 
there are 10 to the 500 possible universes    
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3017) with different values of the constants 
consistent with the laws of nature    
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3022) 10 to the 500 the portion of these universes uh 
that can permit life is infinitesimally small    
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3030) the range is incredibly minuscule what is life 
life is an organism's ability to take in food    
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3036) process it grow and develop and reproduce after 
its kind and i'll end with this inshallah to allah    
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3042) alvin platinga he's a professor at notre dame 
gives another analogy just imagine you have these    
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3047) large dials like combination lock dials there's a 
million of them and they all go up to a thousand    
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3055) and he says if you can get the right combination 
a million that go up to a thousand will give you    
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3061) a billion dollars right that is more likely than 
a life permitting universe that is more likely    
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/If3cNUixEBM?t=3069) than a life-permitting universe so the result 
is allahu majjud that's how i'm ending inshallah
