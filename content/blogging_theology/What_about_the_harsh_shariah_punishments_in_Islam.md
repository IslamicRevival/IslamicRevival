This YouTube video discusses the concept of sharia law and the severity of punishments in Islam.  argues that the severity of punishments in sharia law is often misunderstood and that the law is based on principles of mercy.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKdJ0etaI2g&t=0)** This book quotes the Prophet Muhammad saying that the severity of punishments in Islam should remain "intact," even if it means they are harsher than punishments in earlier times. The author points out that this is because the principle of the punishment should be upheld, rather than the punishment itself. For example, a thief might have his hand cut off, but not if he steals from genuine need or because his family is hungry.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKdJ0etaI2g&t=300)**  a westerner who was a Muslim for 50 years discusses the concept of sharia law. He notes that, although the severity of punishments in sharia law is often overshadowed by the law of mercy, it is never to the extent of undermining the abiding principles that are its basis. He also discusses a story of a man who came to the prophet and confessed his sin, and was given whatever punishment was due to him.

[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=3) people in the west are often horrified  
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=5) by the idea of sharia law  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=8) particularly the harsh punishments that  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=11) are mandated for certain offences  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=14) and i think there's often a  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=15) misunderstanding uh in the west about  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=17) these punishments and to explain why i  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=20) just want to share a few words from uh  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=22) this book by guy eaton a celebrated  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=25) english muslim uh convert and writer  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=29) and diplomat the book's called islam and  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=31) the destiny of man and he briefly  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=34) addresses this misunderstanding in ways  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=36) that are quite helpful i think and on  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=39) page 185  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=41) he writes as follows  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=44) the harsh punishments imposed under  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=47) islamic law  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=49) though less harsh than those prevailing  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=51) in europe until comparatively recently  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=54) are the expression of principles which  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=57) cannot be changed to suit our  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=59) convenience  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=61) what matters however is not that the  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=64) punishment should be inflicted whenever  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=66) appropriate but the principle should  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=69) remain  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=70) intact the prophet told his people quote  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=74) to avert penalties by doubts  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=78) and any strategy which averts the  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=81) penalty without impugning the law is  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=84) legitimate  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=86) the tale is told of a lawyer in haroon's  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=89) time who rose to wealth and eminence  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=92) after devising a subtle legal argument  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=96) which saved the caliph from having to  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=98) charge his own son with adultery  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=102) the westerner might say that this  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=104) cunning lawyer earned himself a fortune  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=107) by twisting the law to suit his master  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=111) the muslim on the other hand approves  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=114) his conduct in that he found a way for  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=117) the caliph to show mercy  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=120) without offending against the majesty of  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=122) the law  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=125) the severity of the punishment for  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=127) adultery marks the gravity of this  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=130) offence against a society based on the  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=134) integrity of the family and its delicate  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=137) web of relationships  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=140) the existence of the penalty makes the  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=142) necessary point  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=144) but his application is made almost  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=147) impossible  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=148) except in cases of voluntary confession  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=152) by the proviso  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=154) that for  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=155) unimpeachable witnesses must have  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=158) observed the act in detail  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=160) and must submit to being flogged for  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=163) perjury if the case is still not proved  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=168) flogging is specified as the penalty for  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=171) a number of offenses but the law does  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=174) not specify what instrument is to be  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=177) used and in the early days of islam it  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=180) was often nothing more damaging than a  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=183) light sandal or the hem of a garment  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=187) this was still technically a flogging  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=190) the point was made and the law was  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=193) upheld  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=195) a thief may have his hand cut off  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=198) but not if he stole from genuine need or  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=202) because his family was hungry  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=204) or if he stole the property of the state  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=208) it's a little footnote here in guyan's  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=210) book and he writes unlike contemporary  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=213) advocates of nationalization the muslim  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=216) jurists of ancient times maintained with  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=219) perfect logic  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=220) that the pub that public property is  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=223) indeed public and therefore quite  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=226) different to private property  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=228) each citizen is part owner or whatever  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=232) belongs to the state and a man cannot  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=234) steal from himself  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=238) perjury even in a civil case is an  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=241) offense of the utmost gravity since it  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=244) is an offence against the law itself  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=248) and forensic skill  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=250) employed in an unjust cause is condemned  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=256) you bring disputes to me said the  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=258) prophet but it may be that some of you  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=261) are better able to put their case than  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=264) others  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=265) i have to decide on the evidence before  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=268) me  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=269) if i happen to expropriate the right of  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=272) anyone in favor of his brother  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=275) let not the latter take it for in that  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=278) case i have given him a piece of  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=281) hellfire  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=282) end quote  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=285) the position of a judge like that of a  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=288) ruler is unenviable  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=291) we are told by the chroniclers about a  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=293) certain pietist in abbasid times who  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=297) stormed into the caliph's uh audience  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=300) chamber and denounced him to his face  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=303) for tyranny and injustice  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=306) the best jihad the prophet once said is  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=309) a true word in the presence of a tyrant  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=313) the man had gone by the time the caliph  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=316) could devise a punishment sufficiently  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=319) cruel to meet his case  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=322) this was that he should be appointed a  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=325) judge  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=326) and an edict issue to the effect that no  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=329) judgment of his should be overruled by  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=333) any court of appeal  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=336) soldiers were sent to bring him back for  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=338) condemnation but he was never found  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=343) in islam the rigor of sharia law is  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=346) always overshadowed by the law of mercy  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=351) but never to the extent of undermining  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=354) the abiding principles which are its  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=357) basis  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=359) a certain man in medina came to the  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=361) prophet to confess as sin  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=363) and received whatever punishment was due  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=366) to him  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=367) for it was according to a hadith  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=370) better to blush in this world than in  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=373) the hereafter  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=375) he was asked if he could free a slave  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=378) but he could not he was asked if he  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=381) could fast two months  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=383) but he replied that he could not  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=386) finally he was asked if he would provide  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=388) food for the poor  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=391) when he replied that he could not he was  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=393) told to wait while the prophet  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=395) considered the matter  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=398) at this point someone came in with a  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=400) large basket of dates as a gift for the  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=404) prophet  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=405) who then presented them to the waiting  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=407) man and instructed him to give them as  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=410) sadaka that is as a gift to the needy  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=414) am i to give them to someone poorer than  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=417) myself messenger of allah ask the man  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=421) i swear by allah there is no poorer  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=424) family the mine between the two lava  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=426) plains of medina  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=429) the prophet laughed  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=430) until it is said his eye teeth were  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=433) visible and told the sinner  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=436) then give them to your family to eat  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=442) and the quote there really so i think  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=443) that's a fascinating a much more  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=445) holistic and truer insight into the  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=449) nature of sharia law and the hadood  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=450) punishments in their true setting  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=453) where mercy tempers  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=455) the rigor the harshness of the  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=457) punishments and if you want to read more  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=459) about this subject in this chapter i do  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=461) recommend you  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=463) read islam and the destiny of man one of  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=465) the the greatest books i think in the  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=467) english language on the subject of islam  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=470) written by a westerner who was a muslim  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=473) for 50 years actually at the time of his  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=476) death  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=477) several years ago  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/cKdJ0etaI2g?t=478) until next time
