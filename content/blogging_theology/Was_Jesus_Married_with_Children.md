 argues that there is no evidence to suggest that Jesus was married, despite the popular belief that he was. It cites the lack of mention of a wife in any ancient Christian literature, as well as the fact that there were many single, celibate adults in Jesus' time, as evidence that he was not married.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uiAfPQIo_o&t=0)** Some people believe that Jesus was likely married, based on the assumption that at the time, Jewish men did not typically abstain from sexual activity. However, this is not the case - there are many single celibate adults from the time of Jesus, and no ancient Christian literature mentions Jesus having a wife.

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=1) was jesus married with children ? because of 
several bestseller books such as the 1980s    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=8) classic "holy blood holy grail" and the best-selling 
book of modern times "the da vinci code" . many people    
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=16) have begun to think that jesus was probably 
married with at least one child is this true ?  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=24) for an answer to that question i turn to "THE NEW 
TESTAMENT a historical introduction to the early    
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=30) christian writings" fifth edition by professor Bart 
Ehrman who has written quite a bit on this actually    
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=36) and he gives us his view and he says : one of 
the major arguments in favor of this view is    
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=45) that allegedly jewish men at the time were always 
married and bachelorhood was virtually unheard of .    
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=54) unfortunately this is not the true at all . we know 
of numerous single celibate adult men from the    
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=62) time of jesus for example the authors of the dead 
sea scrolls (these are known as the essenes) before    
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=69) jesus and afterwards people such as the apostle 
paul . what is striking is that both the essenes    
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=78) and paul were apocalyptic jews expecting the end 
of all things to soon arrive . for them the imminent    
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=86) arrival of the kingdom was the best argument 
against getting married and being tied down to    
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=92) social obligations in the present age . this age 
is soon to end . jesus was also an apocalyptic jew    
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=102) there is nothing at all implausible 
about him being single and celibate .  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=109) in addition , it is important to point out that in 
none of our gospels there is ever a reference not    
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=115) even one reference to jesus being married . this is 
true not only of the gospels of matthew , mark , luke    
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=123) and john ; it is true of every gospel that exists 
from the ancient world the gospels of philip , mary ,  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=132) thomas , peter , judas and on and on . and these are 
some of the books that are still available to be    
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=142) read today in the description there . and not 
only the gospels in fact no ancient christian    
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=149) literature of any kind whatsoever is there any 
reference to jesus having a wife . it should be    
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=156) pointed out that the authors of these books had 
no qualms about mentioning his other relatives his    
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=163) father , his mother , his brothers , his sisters are all 
named . if he had a wife why would she not be named .  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=173) in light of the fact that there is not a 
shred of evidence that jesus was married   
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=179) and that we know of other apocalyptic 
jews like him who are not married    
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=184) it is very difficult to think of solid 
grounds for thinking jesus was married .  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=191) and in fact there are reasons for thinking that 
he was not . in an argument that he had with the    
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=197) sadducees . if you can read this in mark's 
gospel chapter 12 verses 18 to 27 . jesus   
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=205) indicates that in the coming kingdom , there will 
be no marriage moreover throughout his ministry    
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=213) he insisted that his followers begin adopting 
the ways of the kingdom in the present .  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=221) if people were not to be married then and jesus 
and his followers were trying to live the life of    
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=227) the kingdom now . that it makes best sense that he 
was already trying to live the life of the angels    
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/6uiAfPQIo_o?t=235) not married but single and celibate . end 
quote . what do you think ? till next time .
