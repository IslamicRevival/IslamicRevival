[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=3) The Quran continues to surprise me even though 
I've read it from cover to cover in English    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=8) at least, I just came across a couple 
of verses today I just wanted to share    
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=12) uh with you which surprised me even though I've 
read them before and by the way I was reading    
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=17) this book called classical Islamic theology it's 
a Cambridge companion it's an academic work I'm    
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=23) reading it through um just to educate myself and 
the first chapter is called Quran and Hadith by    
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=30) professor Abdul Haleem, he's a very distinguished 
professor at SOAS at the University of London    
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=36) and he's a brilliant translator of the Quran 
and his celebrated translation of the Quran    
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=42) into English this is it here the Quran a 
new translation by professor Abdul Haleem    
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=47) published by Oxford university press which is 
the gold standard I'm told in academic courses    
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=54) at universities on the Quran at least when 
people refer to the English of course anyway    
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=59) the point of this is I was reading this chapter 
very familiar actually to be honest with its    
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=64) themes but I want to just refresh myself again and 
then it says things which are beautifully put says    
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=71) the Quran describes itself as a scripture which 
God sent down to his prophet and this expression    
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=78) sent down in its various derivations is 
used in the Quran well over 200 times    
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=84) in Arabic this locution conveys immediately and 
implicitly the principle that the origin of the    
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=92) book is heavenly and that the and that 
Muhammad is no more than its receptacle    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=99) God is the one who speaks in the book Muhammad is 
addressed as o prophet o messenger do do do not do    
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=110) they ask you say this last command 
appearing more than 300 times    
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=117) sometimes the prophet is reproached and then it 
gives two verses uh 9 43 and 80 verses 1 to 11.    
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=125) now I looked up these passages having written 
them before and I thought yeah I just looked    
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=129) them up you know and I was just stunned again to 
read Surah 80 again I wanted to share it with you    
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=137) because I thought it was very revealing not only 
about the Quran but also its relationship with the    
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=143) prophet to the prophet himself and Abdul Haleem 
in his translation has a little paragraph before    
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=151) his translation introducing the chapter very 
helpful concise to the point and he says    
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=158) a Meccan Surah so is revealed in the first stage 
of the prophet's career rather than later on in    
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=164) Medina while the prophet was speaking to some 
disbelieving notables hoping to convert them    
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=171) a blind Muslim man came up to learn from 
him but in his eagerness to attract the    
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=179) disbelievers to Islam the prophet frowned at him 
and that's the title in English of this chapter    
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=186) he frowned this is chapter 80 of the Quran he 
frowned the prophet is then reproached and told    
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=194) not to concern himself with the disbelievers the 
prophet himself is reproached by God in the Quran    
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=202) in the second paragraph which I'll also read 
in a second there is a condemnation of man's    
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=208) ingratitude this is the human race in general 
man becomes self-satisfied and forgets his    
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=214) origin and his final return to God excuse 
me so I'm going to read um read this chapter    
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=221) uh mainly for the first section where there's a 
lesson to that to the prophet here so it begins    
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=228) in an English translation in the name of 
God the most compassionate most merciful he    
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=236) frowned and turned his attention away simply 
because the blind man came to him interrupting    
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=245) you never know oh prophet perhaps he 
may be purified or he may be mindful    
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=252) benefiting from the reminder as for the one who is 
indifferent you gave him your undivided attention    
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=261) even though you are not to blame if he would 
not be purified as for the one who came    
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=268) to you eager to learn being in awe of God you 
were inattentive to him but no this revelation    
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=278) is truly a reminder let's so let whoever 
wills be mindful of it it is written on pages    
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=287) held in honor highly esteemed purified by the 
hands of angel scribes honorable and virtuous    
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=299) this extraordinary passage this passage and 
there are others as I mentioned critical    
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=303) of some things the prophet did proves that the 
prophet delivered the revelations in all honesty    
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=311) even when his own self was uh being criticized 
it seems by God himself so that this speaks of    
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=319) a very I think a very noble and beautiful way that 
God reproaches the prophet in a quiet gentle way I    
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=326) think for being inattentive it seems and then in 
the second part of this surah surah 80 he frowned    
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=334) we read a reminder to those people mankind who 
deny the resurrection and the last day and these    
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=343) are very powerful powerful words condemned are 
disbelieving humans how ungrateful they are    
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=351) to God from what substance did he create them 
he created them from a sperm drop and ordained    
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=359) their development then he makes the way easy 
for them then causes them to die and be buried    
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=367) then when he wills he will resurrect them but no 
they have failed to comply with what he ordered    
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=374) let people then consider their food how we pour 
down rain in abundance and how meticulously    
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=381) split the earth open for sprouts causing grains 
to grow in it as well as grapes and greens and    
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=388) olives and palm trees and dense orchards and fruit 
and fodder all as a means of sustenance for you    
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=396) and your animals then when the overwhelming 
the deafening blast is the the last day    
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=405) comes to pass on that day every person will 
flee from their own siblings and even their    
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=412) mother and father and even their spouse 
and children for then everyone will have    
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=419) enough concern of their own on that day some 
faces will be bright laughing and rejoicing    
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=428) while other faces will be dusty cast in gloom 
those are the disbelievers the wicked ones  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=438) so it's extraordinary uh chapters as I say 
uh it really brings home the sense of uh    
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=444) how the prophet uh delivered the revelations that 
he received with complete honesty even when God    
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=451) is addressing him and in a sense criticizing 
him and there's several passages like this in    
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=457) the Quran what a remarkable book how honest it is 
and uh anyway I just wanted to share with you my    
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/FVRTmCbVJYE?t=463) renewed amazement at the Quran when I 
read it again and again, till next time.
