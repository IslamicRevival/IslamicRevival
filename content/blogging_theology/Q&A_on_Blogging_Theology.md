[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/2TKVGQ9OsnA?t=6) really good idea not because i

[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/2TKVGQ9OsnA?t=31) scholar but i might have a few books and  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/2TKVGQ9OsnA?t=34) maybe to ask a scholar or two you never  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/2TKVGQ9OsnA?t=36) know um so perhaps i do it won't be live

[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/2TKVGQ9OsnA?t=40) at the moment but um at least um if i  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/2TKVGQ9OsnA?t=43) have these questions
