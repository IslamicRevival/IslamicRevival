[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=1) I was just thinking walking through uh  
[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=4) Francis rural France in the middle of  
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=6) nowhere that back in London where I  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=7) spent most of my time  
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=9) wherever one goes in public you can  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=12) never be sure you're not being observed  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=13) by someone you know walking down a  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=15) street or in a park there's always  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=17) people around there's always cameras  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=19) there's always people driving by you can  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=21) always be seen by at least someone or  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=23) potentially but here I thought there's  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=25) no one here looking around  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=28) it's empty I'm not being observed by  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=30) anyone and then almost immediately I  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=33) corrected myself because that's not true  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=35) I'm being observed by the recording  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=37) angels and the two other Angels who are  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=41) like guardian angels for everyone and  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=44) then of course I'm being observed by God  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=46) and then I thought were there a gin and  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=49) then the shaytan in fact nowhere am I  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=52) not observed anywhere on Earth I guess I  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=55) could say I'm not observed by human  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=57) beings here I think there's no evidence  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=59) of any human beings here it's very very  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=61) quiet but lots of other creatures and  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=65) the Creator himself of course are always  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=67) observing  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=69) me observing us recording watching so  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=73) we're never ever truly alone anywhere in  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/_z4HtL1jpwk?t=77) the universe just a thought
