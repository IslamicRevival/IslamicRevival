The video discusses the ways in which the Quran's portrayal of prophets and patriarchs differs from that of the Bible. argues that the Quran is more concerned with well-known accounts of the Bible's principle characters than with the Bible itself. He provides quotes from the Qur'an to illustrate his point.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2')">0:00:02</a> the quran has a great deal to say about the
patriarchs and the prophets sent to previous
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7')">0:00:07</a> peoples especially to the israelites but in
telling its version of these stories sometimes
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('13')">0:00:13</a> the narrative is very similar to the bible
and sometimes it's radically different and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('19')">0:00:19</a> i want to explore why this might be the case
with the help of this book the bible in arabic
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('27')">0:00:27</a> the scriptures of the people of the book in the
language of islam by sydney h griffith who is
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('34')">0:00:34</a> professor in the department of semitic
and egyptian languages and literatures
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('38')">0:00:38</a> at the catholic university of america this is
quite a new book and it has some rave reviews on
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('47')">0:00:47</a> the back by leading scholars for example from
yale university it says the bible in arabic
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('53')">0:00:53</a> represents the work of a scholar at the height
of his powers griffith demonstrates widespread
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('59')">0:00:59</a> mastery of his subjects his expertise spans
not only christian arabic translation and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('64')">0:01:04</a> interpretation of the bible but also jewish and
islamic arabic literature as well the result is a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('70')">0:01:10</a> book that fills a conspicuous gap in our knowledge
it will surely become a standard in the field
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('77')">0:01:17</a> that's from steve davis who is a professor at yale
university so i just want to share with you what
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('84')">0:01:24</a> griffith says uh about this uh because i think he
has some fascinating uh ideas his hypotheses are
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('91')">0:01:31</a> very compelling i think although obviously you can
disagree about why the stories of moses abraham
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('99')">0:01:39</a> and david and job and so on are similar in uh to
what we find in the bible yet sometimes they're
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('105')">0:01:45</a> different and what's really going on here why is
the quran different from the bible about these
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('110')">0:01:50</a> patriarchs and prophets and griffith comes up with
a plausible uh view i think so i'm just going to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('116')">0:01:56</a> read some uh extracts from chapter 2 the bible in
the arabic quran and i'll be making some comments
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('123')">0:02:03</a> as always on root the quran is a very is very
conscious of the bible and sometimes presents
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('130')">0:02:10</a> itself as offering once again a revelation
previously sent down in the torah and the gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> one verse even seems to put the quran on a par
with these earlier scriptures when it speaks of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('142')">0:02:22</a> the promise of paradise for those who fight in
the way of god as already truthfully recorded
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('148')">0:02:28</a> in the torah the gospel and the quran that's the
the ninth chapter verse 111. on the other hand
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('156')">0:02:36</a> the kran's text insistently recalls the earlier
biblical stories of the patriarchs and prophets
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('163')">0:02:43</a> and even appeals to the books of the torah
the prophets the psalms and the gospel by name
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('169')">0:02:49</a> on the other hand islamic scripture also pursues
a reading of its own and often noticeably distinct
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('176')">0:02:56</a> from and sometimes even contrary to the biblical
understanding of jews or christians for the quran
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183')">0:03:03</a> is in fact very selective in its approach to
the bible and to biblical law law spell lore
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('191')">0:03:11</a> it ignores entirely portions of the scriptures
that are very important to jews and christians
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('196')">0:03:16</a> the new testament pauline epistles that's paul's
letters are a notable instance of this disinterest
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203')">0:03:23</a> they're completely ignored as are large portions
of the former and later prophets in the hebrew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('209')">0:03:29</a> bible what is noticeable is that the quran
is not so much interested in the bible per se
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('215')">0:03:35</a> as it is in well-known accounts of the
bible's principle characters a adam noah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('221')">0:03:41</a> abraham ishmael isaac jacob joseph moses aaron
miriam david solomon even job and jonah along
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('228')">0:03:48</a> with zechariah john the baptist mary and jesus son
of mary just to mention the major personalities
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('236')">0:03:56</a> it interweaves recollection of this recollections
of the stories of these patriarchs and prophets
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('242')">0:04:02</a> into its own distinctive prophetology this
is a very griffith word prophetology his own
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('249')">0:04:09</a> understanding of the prophets the way it presents
the prophets culminating in muhammad the messenger
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('255')">0:04:15</a> of god and the seal of the prophets in surah
33 40. and in the presentation of god's message
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('263')">0:04:23</a> to the community of believers the prophet has
summoned to hear it the quran thus appears on the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> horizon of biblical history as a new paradigm for
the reading figuratively speaking of a familiar
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> scriptural narrative in an arabic speaking milieu
offering a new construal of a familiar salvation
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> history albeit not without echoes of earlier
traditions so that's uh sydney griffith setting
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('289')">0:04:49</a> up the chapter um i think he's he's more or less
saying that the crime tells these familiar stories
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('297')">0:04:57</a> of moses and abraham and so on in its own way
according to his own understanding of prophethood
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('304')">0:05:04</a> and there's more to come about this he continues
at the end when he summarizes the chapter having
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('311')">0:05:11</a> looked at each of these prophets in turn and what
the quran says and how it differs from the bible
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('316')">0:05:16</a> the quick review of quranic presentations of
biblical patriarchs and prophets just rehearsed
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('323')">0:05:23</a> selective and schematic as it is nevertheless
nevertheless makes three things fairly clear
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('330')">0:05:30</a> biblical personalities in their stories
are recalled according to the paradigm
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('335')">0:05:35</a> of quranic prophetology and not according to
jewish or christian narrative patterns the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('341')">0:05:41</a> narratives are sometimes hauntingly close to the
biblical versions but they frequently incorporate
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('348')">0:05:48</a> non-biblical jewish or christian apocryphal and
traditional law l-o-r-e again and there are almost
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('356')">0:05:56</a> never any actual quotations from a known biblical
text or for that matter from any other text
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> these observations give rise to three preliminary
conclusions the sources of the quran's biblical
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('370')">0:06:10</a> and traditional reminiscences are oral the
quran's recollections of the biblical patriarchs
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('376')">0:06:16</a> and prophets according to the paradigm of its
own prophetology bespeaks the arabic scriptures
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('384')">0:06:24</a> corrective even polemical stance towards jewish
and christian scriptures and traditional law lore
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('393')">0:06:33</a> so what he's saying here is put it in simpler
english because it's a very academic book this
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('398')">0:06:38</a> is not what's not meant for the the daily mail
reader or something um what he's saying is that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('402')">0:06:42</a> the quran obviously retells these same stories
according to his own understanding of prophethood
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('409')">0:06:49</a> but it it does it not just summarizing or
paraphrasing what's in the bible it corrects
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('415')">0:06:55</a> it it corrects the biblical stories it talks about
even polemical stance towards jewish and christian
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('421')">0:07:01</a> scriptures it clearly views these scriptures as
distorted as not speaking the whole truth about
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('427')">0:07:07</a> moses abraham david and so on so this is what the
the quran is doing it has it has this corrective
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('435')">0:07:15</a> polemical relationship with the previous
scriptures and he continues and giving the lack
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('442')">0:07:22</a> of actual quotations from the bible the presence
of the bible in the quran is not textual in other
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('448')">0:07:28</a> words it's not quoting chunks in the bible in its
own words in its own words it is present but by
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455')">0:07:35</a> way of illusion illusion and re-presentation so in
other words it retells stories which sound eerily
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('463')">0:07:43</a> familiar to us if we know the bible well the
other hand they they sound different as well but
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> the reason is the quran is correcting the bible
the stories according to sydney clifford's here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('477')">0:07:57</a> so um the last part i want to read
is the last paragraph of the chapter
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> uh entitled the bible encountered in the quran
the bible is both in the quran and not in the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('494')">0:08:14</a> quran that is to say it has virtually no
textual presence he says virtually because
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('499')">0:08:19</a> arguably there is a single verse from
assam that is quoted in the quran
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('507')">0:08:27</a> that is to say it has virtually no textual
presence but the selective presence of an
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> interpreted bible in islamic scripture is
undeniable and the selection process involved
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> in the inclusion of biblical reminiscences in the
quran according to the hypothesis advanced here
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('526')">0:08:46</a> is one determined by the quran's own
distinctive prophetology that is to say
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('531')">0:08:51</a> recollections of biblical patriarchs and prophets
and references to the earlier scriptures that tell
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('537')">0:08:57</a> their stories appear as integral components of the
quran's advancement of its own prophetic message
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('545')">0:09:05</a> and what is more the quran is corrective
of and even polemical towards the earlier
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('551')">0:09:11</a> readings of the scripture people that's
jews and christians to the point that it
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('556')">0:09:16</a> can even accuse jews of distorting
the scripture of god sent to them
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('561')">0:09:21</a> and then he gives some quotes from the quran this
dimension of the quran's reprise of the bible
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568')">0:09:28</a> bespeaks the opening of a new book altogether in
the growing library of books on the interpreted
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('575')">0:09:35</a> bible or perhaps it bespeaks not so much a
new book as a corrected alternative scripture
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('582')">0:09:42</a> one that recalls the tanakh and the bible but
ultimately rejects them in the forms in which
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('588')">0:09:48</a> jews and christians actually have them
it is no wonder then that for the letter
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('593')">0:09:53</a> but that for the later muslim scholars there
was for the most part little interest over the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('599')">0:09:59</a> centuries in the bible as the jews or christians
actually have it the quran has made it irrelevant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('609')">0:10:09</a> which is very very interesting my own personal
analogy for this uh he talks about the this
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('617')">0:10:17</a> dimension of the quran's reprise of the bible
bespeaks the opening of a new book or perhaps
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('623')">0:10:23</a> it bespeaks not so much an uber as a corrected
alternative scripture what we're looking at to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('627')">0:10:27</a> use a very different analogy is like you're
updating your software from particularly a a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('634')">0:10:34</a> software computer that may have just about worked
but nevertheless was riddled with problems and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('639')">0:10:39</a> distortions and you came a lot and you replaced it
with an ac pc software system i'm not mentioning
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('645')">0:10:45</a> apple here or my own macbook pro one that doesn't
crash one that's not uh you know messed up
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('651')">0:10:51</a> and uh that's a very crude analogy here i think
uh the quran is the pristine replacement for a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('658')">0:10:58</a> scripture that has been changed and misinterpreted
and partially lost or forgotten and so on although
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('663')">0:11:03</a> it still retains some of its uh integrity in
that is speaking of moses and abraham and so on
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('671')">0:11:11</a> so i think that that would be my own kind of
rough reinterpretation of what griffith is saying
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('677')">0:11:17</a> um so that that explains i think and i find this
personally i find this plausible this explains why
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> uh there are these differences why
uh the crown's presentation of moses
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('687')">0:11:27</a> as a righteous man is so different from the
bloodthirsty killer that is presented in the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('692')">0:11:32</a> bible someone who commands in the name of god
that women and children should be killed we
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('698')">0:11:38</a> would not find that in islam of course at all
finally um there's a little footnote by way of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('704')">0:11:44</a> uh parenthesis here uh fitness footnote 64 by
issa the name of isa which i find fascinating
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('710')">0:11:50</a> and he says of the many explanations for the form
of jesus's name as it appears in the quran what's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('717')">0:11:57</a> the origin where is this why is it issa the most
reasonable one from this writer's point of view
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('723')">0:12:03</a> is that it reflects an arabic speaker's spelling
of what he hears in an arabic articulation of the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('732')">0:12:12</a> common eastern syria syrian form of the name issue
i-s-h-o i-s-h-o so it's an arabic understanding
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('742')">0:12:22</a> of the common syrian form and of course the
syrian form is the aramaic form as well so
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('751')">0:12:31</a> i do recommend this book very much it is a
heavyweight academic tome no worse for that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('758')">0:12:38</a> it has rave reviews as i say from academics in
the field and i think it plausibly uh advances
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('764')">0:12:44</a> the case which has been believed i think by
muslims most muslims throughout the centuries
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('769')">0:12:49</a> that the the quran uh corrects uh and gives
you the truth about the uh the stories of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('776')">0:12:56</a> the people of the moses and abraham jesus and so
on and it frees it from the corruptions that um
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('783')">0:13:03</a> have crept into these scriptures that
christians and jews have today until next time
