presents evidence that Muhammad was a true prophet. The most compelling evidence cited is an incident in which Muhammad is told that the eclipse was caused by the death of his son. This incident is seen as evidence of Muhammad's prophetic abilities because he was able to correctly interpret the eclipse as a sign from God.

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=1) Today I begin a new series of 60-second sound 
bites, here is the first. There is an ocean of    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=8) evidence that proves that Muhammad was a true 
prophet but the most compelling one for me    
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=14) personally is the following incident narrated in 
an authentic hadith during the death of his son    
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=20) ibrahim: 'There was a solar eclipse in the time 
of God's messenger on the day his son Ibrahim    
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=26) died the people said 'the eclipse of the sun 
has happened due to the death of Ibrahim!'    
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=33) God's messenger said 'The sun and the moon 
are two of God's signs, they are not eclipsed    
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=39) due to the death or life of anyone so when 
you see them (the eclipse of the sun or moon)    
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=46) supplicate to God and offer prayers until the 
eclipse is over." This proves to me that he was    
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=54) an authentic Prophet of God. An imposter would have 
claimed credit for this astronomical coincidence    
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/vtxDK8NlX9M?t=61) to boost his credibility among his followers but 
Muhammad did not. It has the ring of authenticity!
