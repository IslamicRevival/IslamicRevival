Dr. Bart Ehrman responds to those who believe that Jesus is Yahweh. He argues that, while Jesus is exalted to the highest possible level, he is not identified as Yahweh in the sense that God is. He cites biblical passages which seem to indicate that Jesus is not Yahweh, and concludes that the belief that Jesus is Yahweh is not supported by the evidence.

[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=6) uh the the jesus becoming uh human and  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=8) so on but is it not the case at the very  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=10) end uh paul kind of ends it with the  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=12) doxology with the with to the glory of  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=14) god the father so is it not the case  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=17) that god still remains god yahweh if you  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=19) like and uh so jesus isn't identified as  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=22) god in that sense although he is exalted  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=25) to the highest possible level maybe even  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=27) equality with god but ontologically he's  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=29) not identified as that being would that  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=32) be  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=32) i would say that's right that he's not  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=34) so  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=35) for some reason people have started i  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=37) don't know how far back this goes i've  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=39) just recently heard of people saying  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=40) that jesus is yahweh and i don't know no  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=43) not in the new testament no not the  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=44) bible but certainly not here because god  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=47) so he he he's a separate being from god  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=50) he to begin with he's equal  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=52) it's he so to begin with jesus is in the  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=56) form of god even though he was in the  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=58) form of god he did not regard equality  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=60) with god something to be grasped this is  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=63) a very complicated verse because of the  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=65) greek yeah it's not clear  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=68) whether it means it's not something he  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=69) wanted to hold on to or if it wasn't  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=72) something he wanted to reach for  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=74) and i think it i think the word the  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=75) greek word  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=78) to read is it more that means form  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=81) he's in the morphe  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=82) the more the form of god  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=84) and he didn't regard the equality with  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=87) god the esau  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=88) something to be grasped with grasp is  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=90) harpazzo which means  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=92) to like to you know grab something and i  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=94) think what it's saying is that before he  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=96) became a human  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=97) he was he was in a divine form he was a  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=100) divine being  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=101) but he wasn't equal with god  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=103) but at the end god highly exalts him and  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=106) gives him the name above every name  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=109) so that at the name of jesus every knee  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=111) shall bow and  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=114) that's taken out of isaiah which said  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=116) this is about yahweh that to him only  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=118) will every knee bow and every time  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=120) confess so it looks like he's made him  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=122) on it on a some kind of equal level but  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=125) but  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=125) he's is it  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=127) honorary than for paul than onto logical  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=129) it's not like a metaphysical reality  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=131) it's kind of yeah he's his exalted  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=133) proposition rather than having that by  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=135) right all eternity yeah that's right  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=137) he's not he's not metaphysically i mean  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=139) paul wouldn't use these terms of course  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=141) not  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=141) physically god but he but god has has  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=145) has made him an equal at least in terms  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=148) of human worship goes uh for paul and  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=150) that coincides with what you get  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=152) elsewhere in paul like in first  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=153) corinthians 15 where where christ  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=157) everything is subject to christ and then  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=158) he subjects everything to god you know  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=160) and so it's there's still this kind of  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=163) almost a subordination and a later later  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=166) you know theologians wouldn't talk about  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=167) subordinationism but but there is that  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/J6V8qXHw1fI?t=169) kind of leveling i think
