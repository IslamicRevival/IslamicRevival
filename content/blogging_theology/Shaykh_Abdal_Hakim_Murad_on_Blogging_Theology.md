Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad discusses his journey from atheism to Islam, and how he believes that science has shown that the universe is too ordered and beautiful to be explained by chance.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">01:00:00</a>** Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad discusses how he has come to believe that Islam is a religion of life, and that the principle of life is something that can only be explained by the existence of a transcendent being.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('76')">0:01:16</a> arabic uh and also from i think from turkish um 
possibly from persian i don't know into english    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('83')">0:01:23</a> and uh he joins us today as i say and i want to 
focus on themes arising from his most recent work    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('91')">0:01:31</a> uh which has proved to be quite a a sensation uh 
called traveling home essays on islam in europe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('99')">0:01:39</a> published by quillian press last year and the uh 
what one reviewer um on i think was on amazon uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> described the prose style as complex but well 
thought through and i think i agree with that the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('116')">0:01:56</a> the the language is uh challenging it's demanding 
but in a good way making you think and ponder    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> over the meaning of the thoughts that are conveyed 
therein and it's certainly well thought through um    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('129')">0:02:09</a> and i just wanted to introduce the book by reading 
a paragraph from the book to give you a flavor    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('135')">0:02:15</a> of the style and the theme uh from which uh many 
of the uh insights come from and he um he writes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('145')">0:02:25</a> that um muslims now this is obviously muslims 
in europe primarily but muslims find themselves    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('151')">0:02:31</a> at home everywhere meaning everywhere in the 
world and what is this muslim sense of belonging    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('158')">0:02:38</a> that believers feel more at home in a place than 
any atheist could since to lose contact with god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('166')">0:02:46</a> is immediately to forfeit one sense of connection 
to a place of his god making it is to feel one's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('174')">0:02:54</a> roots and identity shrivel there can be no truly 
english german or russian atheist from this kind    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('182')">0:03:02</a> of muslim perspective lenin was not russian 
douglas murray he's not british and sam harris    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('189')">0:03:09</a> is not american they seem to wait in a for law 
foreign encampment even when officially at home    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> by contrast to become muslim or to arrive from 
an islamically abrahamic place is to maintain    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203')">0:03:23</a> that traditional sensibility which perceives god's 
signs super abundantly everywhere is immediately    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('212')">0:03:32</a> to see the land with understanding and hence to 
begin to grow roots and to adorn and engage the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('218')">0:03:38</a> earth such very roughly is the islamic theory 
of abrahamic mobility unlike israel wanderings    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('226')">0:03:46</a> in exile which await the messianic intervention 
which would take the people to a home greater    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> than all homes muslims travel from one home to 
an equal other and do not cherish a return to the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('240')">0:04:00</a> mother of cities except as visitors they migrate 
abrahamically but every country for them is a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('250')">0:04:10</a> promised land there's almost rising to the level 
of poetry in my view it's beautifully written    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('256')">0:04:16</a> clothes uh and uh makes its point with uh supreme 
eloquence um but enough flattery sincerely meant    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('264')">0:04:24</a> um would you like just to expand a bit on that 
perhaps in simpler language language form as i'd    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('271')">0:04:31</a> shut up now yes i sometimes forget what i myself 
intended when i write those long sentences but i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('278')">0:04:38</a> think what i'm reaching for is the idea that there 
is something rather startlingly miraculous about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('285')">0:04:45</a> the seerah story which of course is pivots around 
a migration insofar as it clearly continues and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> uplifts and affirms and repairs certain aspects 
of the pre-existing jewish story in particular    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('301')">0:05:01</a> but doesn't include the idea of a unique people or 
a uniquely appropriate land in which they belong    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> so even though sort of western arabia was 
this dusty remote place that few people in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('315')">0:05:15</a> larger ecumenical hellenistic world had ever 
thought about nonetheless it becomes the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('320')">0:05:20</a> crucible for something that turns out to be very 
successfully universal and you do find that in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326')">0:05:26</a> the the anti-tribalism of the holy prophet's 
migration the fact that he establishes in medina    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('332')">0:05:32</a> this mosque this place of worship which is to be 
the first non-tribal non-racial non-national space    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('339')">0:05:39</a> that arabia has ever seen so that you have 
bilal the abyssinian you have sohaib the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('346')">0:05:46</a> syrian byzantine you have salman the persian and 
they can go and be and pray anywhere in the mosque    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('354')">0:05:54</a> and that's a kind of sign of islam's universal 
aspiration that this is a migration it's a kind    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('361')">0:06:01</a> of exodus but it's not an exodus that kind of 
is to a place where everybody has to be and from    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368')">0:06:08</a> which they've been exiled but it's an exodus into 
god's god's wide earth and so the uh the hadith    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('376')">0:06:16</a> the whole earth has been made a mosque for 
me which is one of the hussites the unique    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('380')">0:06:20</a> qualities of the holy prophet's religion turns 
out to be the case that despite the details    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> of the sunnah the sun that works and helps us in 
21st century britain and in australia and malaysia    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('396')">0:06:36</a> and turns out to be remarkably sort of portable 
that's one of the miracles i think of islam that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('402')">0:06:42</a> despite the particularity of its origin it has 
served as a religion that uplifts transforms    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('408')">0:06:48</a> invigorates so so many peoples 
so the corollary of that is that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('415')">0:06:55</a> if the quran is pointing us towards god's signs 
in nature and saying that the whole world is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('422')">0:07:02</a> god's and so migration is just migrating from 
one part of god's manifestation to another part    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('429')">0:07:09</a> that wherever you go if you have a sound 
heart and you're reading the scripture    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('434')">0:07:14</a> you will see the sacred in the place where 
you are there's no place where god is absent    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('441')">0:07:21</a> uh and therefore muslims in europe now looking 
around traveling in the earth considering the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('449')">0:07:29</a> ayats the signs of god the local securities the 
theophanies the wonders of nature beauty etc    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('456')">0:07:36</a> actually have more right to consider themselves 
to be belonging to those places than those who    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('463')">0:07:43</a> are atheists and therefore have migrated away 
from the deep narrative of those places a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('470')">0:07:50</a> couple of days ago i find myself driving on the a3 
whatever it is from which you can see stonehenge    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('476')">0:07:56</a> all right and stonehenge is from the stone 
age it's even before iron age bronze age it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('482')">0:08:02</a> really ancient enigmatic we don't really know 
what it was uh but it's a reminder of the fact    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('488')">0:08:08</a> that uh people in this island have until a 
generation ago always focused their life on the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('497')">0:08:17</a> sacred in a sense of the secularity the mystery 
of the earth no doubt in often aberrant ways but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('503')">0:08:23</a> that's normative to what it is to belong to this 
to this island and so muslims superficially judge    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('510')">0:08:30</a> to be the people who most obviously don't belong 
particularly by the kind of anti-immigrant right    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> uh turn out to be the people who most belong 
to the broad outlines if not the details    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> of the the sacred story of what used to be called 
the matter of britain if you look at even william    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('529')">0:08:49</a> blake and english sort of platonic speculators 
about the meaning of of the country they'll    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('535')">0:08:55</a> say well it's about god it's about a particular 
way of reflecting and and affirming the divine    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('540')">0:09:00</a> nature so muslims do that despite the superficial 
exoticism uh whereas the atheists certainly don't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('548')">0:09:08</a> so i think from a deeper historical perspective 
not even necessarily a religious perspective    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('553')">0:09:13</a> one can see the muslims as having a deep right 
to belong and as being authentically indigenous    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('559')">0:09:19</a> whatever their dna might be as from our point 
of view irrelevant uh whereas these new uh sort    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568')">0:09:28</a> of secular and atheistic utilitarian scientific 
interpretations uh have to be seen as uh denying    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('578')">0:09:38</a> people really the right to feel that they are 
rooted and belong to this country so i'm trying to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('583')">0:09:43</a> invert the usual narrative that perceives muslims 
as kind of wandering outsiders i think on a deeper    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('590')">0:09:50</a> level um given the logic of what this country 
has always been what europe has always been it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('595')">0:09:55</a> the muslims who very evidently belong yeah but i 
just um perhaps challenge you on that slightly uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('602')">0:10:02</a> say douglas murray i've read several of his 
recent books and he's a very eloquent man    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> and you he talks quite openly i think one of 
his books like the suicide of europe about the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('611')">0:10:11</a> loss of faith that characterizes modernity and he 
doesn't rejoice in this he's not like a dawkins    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('618')">0:10:18</a> uh who is a militant atheist he grieves 
over the law of a spiritual heart and i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('625')">0:10:25</a> notice he appeared a day or two ago on um i 
think it's premieres as a christian channel    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('630')">0:10:30</a> in london uh talking with um uh professor tom 
wright the former bishop of durham the christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('636')">0:10:36</a> theologian he's now oxford a very distinguished 
uh christian churchman in his own right    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('642')">0:10:42</a> and i i sense it could be wrong that douglas may 
is looking for a way home the christian tradition    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('648')">0:10:48</a> because he realizes the vacuum the nihilism 
at the heart of of contemporary nationalism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> contemporary populism contemporary anti-muslim 
polemic is not drawing on those noble christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> european traditions of faith or spirituality of 
transcendence uh going back at least as far as the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('668')">0:11:08</a> stonehenge so maybe you know he's not i know he 
is anti-muslim don't get me wrong douglas murray    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674')">0:11:14</a> is but i think underneath that um that rhetoric 
there is nevertheless a heart that is seeking    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('679')">0:11:19</a> faith again and that's human nature isn't 
it because it's what we've always been there    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('684')">0:11:24</a> may even be a god gene some people i think the 
daily telegraph recently published a speculative    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('690')">0:11:30</a> slightly cheeky piece indicating that uh belief is 
so fundamental uh a part of the human metabolism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('697')">0:11:37</a> that perhaps atheism should be classified as 
a mental illness you can imagine the chatter    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('702')">0:11:42</a> that resulted as a result of that but you know 
objectively uh there is a case to be made so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('708')">0:11:48</a> of course these people recognize that they're 
missing something but the problem often is that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('713')">0:11:53</a> uh for psychic or nationalistic or tribal 
sometimes racial reasons they can't see where    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('719')">0:11:59</a> the truth actually is and one of the things 
i'm trying to reach for in the book is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('725')">0:12:05</a> god's truth thanks to another of those    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('729')">0:12:09</a> great historic ironies is placed in our age 
precisely where the elites least expected to be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('738')">0:12:18</a> it's like i gave a talk recently about the 
holy grail and europeans for centuries have    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('742')">0:12:22</a> been kind of scratching around probably not 
far from where you are at the moment in france    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('747')">0:12:27</a> uh the nazis were were digging away in those 
caves in southern france trying to find the grail    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('752')">0:12:32</a> and just last week in glastonbury somebody tried 
to dig up the tomb of king arthur to see if the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('756')">0:12:36</a> was that kind of permanent obsession but according 
to the historians the roots of the grail legend    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('763')">0:12:43</a> are most likely to be found in islam because 
it's the black stone in the kaaba and many    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('768')">0:12:48</a> historians say this is what it is and the medieval 
european legends recognize this even wagner in his    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('775')">0:12:55</a> letters says well isn't it to shame that our 
great german legends actually turn out to be of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('779')">0:12:59</a> saracenic origin that when he was 
writing his great passive files so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('783')">0:13:03</a> but the grail is available this thing that the 
europeans have always been looking for most it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('789')">0:13:09</a> the black stone so it's kind of hidden in plain 
sight if you like you can see it you don't need    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('795')">0:13:15</a> to dig around in provence you can see it if you go 
on the national geographic channel and there it is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('801')">0:13:21</a> but it's in the wrong place for the european ego 
because the point of the grail search and for any    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('808')">0:13:28</a> traditional pilgrimage when the hajj 
days of course now is that it is about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('812')">0:13:32</a> the outward enactment of the inward 
journey which is about overcoming ego    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('817')">0:13:37</a> superbly a pride is the worst of the deadly sins 
and it is generally europe's pride that says well    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('823')">0:13:43</a> i can go through any of these ordeals and i'm 
happy to scale mount doom and fight with black    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('827')">0:13:47</a> dragons and deal with the green knight like 
sir gawain and i'm a real uh real warrior but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('834')">0:13:54</a> when you say well you just you can get to the 
grail temple you can kiss the grail if you like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('840')">0:14:00</a> uh but you have to say seven words in arabic 
in order to be allowed in they say oh well    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('845')">0:14:05</a> i don't fancy that ordeal thank you very much 
i'd rather fight with a black dragon in mount    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('850')">0:14:10</a> doom or something that's that's my kind of 
ordeal so uh this is a divine irony that the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('855')">0:14:15</a> grail is there and it is understood and it is 
the traditional yearning for the european soul    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('863')">0:14:23</a> uh which is not really a christian legend it's 
kind of it is it is from islam it's certainly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('868')">0:14:28</a> not biblical but it's the pride of europe it makes 
it so difficult for them really to consider that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('875')">0:14:35</a> actually god may be placing his secret in our 
age in the place that they are most habituated to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('881')">0:14:41</a> despise with all of those bangladeshis and saudis 
they can't imagine it could be there of all places    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('887')">0:14:47</a> well indeed one of the great ironies 
of all this is that the traditional    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('892')">0:14:52</a> christian faith which is uh 
precipitously declining at least a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('897')">0:14:57</a> you were looking at church attendance in 
the church of england it's in free fall    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('901')">0:15:01</a> you know these people follow a jew from palestine 
from 2000 years ago who wasn't white who didn't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('908')">0:15:08</a> speak english probably um and um and who who 
culturally and linguistically semantically uh uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('916')">0:15:16</a> aramaic is cognate with uh arabic and hebrew uh 
he had much more in common with a certain seventh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('924')">0:15:24</a> century arabian prophet than the archbishop 
of canterbury or tom wright or uh and and yet    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931')">0:15:31</a> that they see him jesus as part of their history 
and somehow have a problem with a very similar    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('937')">0:15:37</a> character who taught basically the same thing 
just down the road in arabia i find that ironic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('943')">0:15:43</a> well it's again rooted in prejudice and you 
have to remember how fiercely europe always    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('947')">0:15:47</a> self-defined as being that which is not islamic 
islam by this miraculous historically unique pro    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('954')">0:15:54</a> process came out of those arabian valleys and 
within 100 years it was in southern france and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('960')">0:16:00</a> the gates of china and this is the great trauma 
of traditional europe i was reading recently a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('966')">0:16:06</a> story of a 16th century protestant in north 
germany who said well clearly the turks are the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('973')">0:16:13</a> most powerful country in the world we know that 
they treat the christians well and allow different    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('977')">0:16:17</a> sex to coins coexist unlike us in germany so 
i think it's wrong biblically to fight against    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('983')">0:16:23</a> them because we're supposed to be pacifists we 
should let the turks invade and christianity will    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('989')">0:16:29</a> do better here than it does under these warring 
catholic and protestant princes and for that of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('994')">0:16:34</a> course he was horribly tortured and put to death 
and they danced on his grave because by the way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('999')">0:16:39</a> uh do you recall i i can find it or you feel 
like i don't recall the poor guys would like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1004')">0:16:44</a> to look that's extraordinary this is the great 
unthought of europe um because you know the great    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1010')">0:16:50</a> the great pilgrimage center of western europe is 
santiago de compostela isn't it and or not quite    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1017')">0:16:57</a> in lourdes actually as about an hour and a half 
yeah but santiago is much bigger and medieval    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1023')">0:17:03</a> english people go there and the kaimino is a big 
thing when you get there to a rather in my view    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1029')">0:17:09</a> over baroque and elaborate bling church at the 
center of it there's the big statue of saint james    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1036')">0:17:16</a> and his title is saint james matamoros the muslim 
killer so the destination of western europe's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1044')">0:17:24</a> big sacred pilgrimage is this big statue and he 
has a white face he's on his horse and with his    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1049')">0:17:29</a> sword he's cutting their heads off these rather 
sad looking dark-skinned muslims who are being    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1054')">0:17:34</a> trampled underfoot and nowadays the church 
finds it a bit unecumenical and embarrassing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1059')">0:17:39</a> so you can see that they arrange flowers to 
kind of disguise these sad-looking muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1070')">0:17:50</a> and that's so deeply rooted in the dna even 
of quite secular people i think like douglas    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1074')">0:17:54</a> murray and so forth that it's just very very hard 
but there are people even from the far right in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1080')">0:18:00</a> europe who have made the leap into islam publicly 
or privately i'm in conversation with some you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1086')">0:18:06</a> know really nationalistic people in europe quite 
well-known people who have wikipedia pages and a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1092')">0:18:12</a> kind of twitter storm whenever they 
say something who have discreetly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1096')">0:18:16</a> come to islam or at least recognize that islam 
is the truth so one should never despair of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1101')">0:18:21</a> those people and um i believe will be a very 
good mahmood when he finally overcomes this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1109')">0:18:29</a> this matamoros dna and and humbles himself 
before the lord of of abraham that would be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1116')">0:18:36</a> a a day to rejoice so uh um you you quite 
do review the coin this term submarines  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1124')">0:18:44</a> what are submarines submarines are those 
people of we don't know how many they are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1130')">0:18:50</a> who convert to islam and do it but without 
announcing it to anybody i even knew a guy    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1138')">0:18:58</a> jewish guy who whose wife was very puzzled that 
kind of four o'clock in the morning he would    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1144')">0:19:04</a> mysteriously get up out of bed and come back 10 
minutes later a little bit damp and she couldn't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1149')">0:19:09</a> figure out what this was about it went on for 
years um but yes i know a full professor here in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1155')">0:19:15</a> cambridge who's been a muslim occasionally you see 
him discreetly in the mosque but he's certainly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1161')">0:19:21</a> not known to be muslim and there's you know 
there's i know a guy who is the senior adviser to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1168')">0:19:28</a> uh a cabinet minister in the current 
government who is an active convert to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1172')">0:19:32</a> islam but i think nobody in boris's team 
suspects this there's quite a lot of them    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1180')">0:19:40</a> um and the idea is that they want the 
beauty of islam and they love the form    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1183')">0:19:43</a> of prayer and the purity of the monotheism 
and what's not to like but all of the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1191')">0:19:51</a> crisis talk about muslim communities and palestine 
and afghanistan and so forth they don't feel that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1197')">0:19:57</a> they want to take on the psycho babble that goes 
with it so they they they keep quiet about it so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1204')">0:20:04</a> yeah there's certainly a lot of people 
like that i find it interesting that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1208')">0:20:08</a> and in europe prominent as you say 
far-right populist um non-muslim leaders    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1216')">0:20:16</a> privately contact you and just and discreetly 
uh send out feelers in a very positive way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1224')">0:20:24</a> or in faith and i think that's uh extraordinary 
ministry to use christian language that you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1229')">0:20:29</a> have to the world well it's a very passive one 
because i don't go out you know i've i've not    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1235')">0:20:35</a> emailed somebody like milo yano pulos and drawn 
the merits of the qurante's attention uh sometimes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1242')">0:20:42</a> what do you mean who's now 
got religion and repented  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1252')">0:20:52</a> is a kind of ultra traditionalist 
catholic of the sort of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1256')">0:20:56</a> if you watch uh church militant and 
those uh catholic websites you can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1266')">0:21:06</a> the fact is that muslims do dichotomize and assume 
that those people are kind of soulless androids    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1273')">0:21:13</a> who we just have to insult and 
push away but everybody has a soul    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1277')">0:21:17</a> everybody was there at the day of the 
primordial covenant when we all said    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1280')">0:21:20</a> yes we bear witness everybody therefore is 
thirsty for god and we shouldn't despair of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1286')">0:21:26</a> anyone and that's part of the beauty of the seerah 
even when the holy prophet was being persecuted    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1292')">0:21:32</a> and his companions tortured and killed he would 
pray in what seemed like the most unlikely way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1300')">0:21:40</a> or strengthen islam by abu hakem or omar the two 
great islamophobes of of the age and omar came to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1308')">0:21:48</a> islam by god's decree and i think that's a more 
healthy place for us to be in double terms than    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1315')">0:21:55</a> just twitter storming people and responding to 
their abuse with more abuse i think that the quran    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1321')">0:22:01</a> says call to the way of your lord with wisdom and 
goodly exhortation and that's a commandment that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1327')">0:22:07</a> i think is binding on us yes well come on perhaps 
uh to the dower scene in the uk shortly but just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1334')">0:22:14</a> perhaps moving on the conversation to um something 
that is summarized in this dance with wopism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1340')">0:22:20</a> um what is him i don't know it's kind of 
a new form of political correctness but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1345')">0:22:25</a> it seems to have become a cultural revolution now 
um and focusing on issues of gender of sexualities    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1354')">0:22:34</a> particularly doing away in my understanding with 
traditional definitions of gender and people now    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1360')">0:22:40</a> who uh well acceptable for people to define uh 
their own personal agenda by their beliefs about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1368')">0:22:48</a> their agenda so if i think i'm a woman then 
i really am a woman and and uh people should    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1373')">0:22:53</a> uh accept that and doctors and powers that 
be will all say yeah this person is a woman    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1379')">0:22:59</a> um and this kind of redefinition of reality um 
i mentioned this because it obviously affects    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1385')">0:23:05</a> all of us but particularly regarding muslims 
in the west in britain uh france uh america    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1391')">0:23:11</a> and so on who are coming under pressure of 
course because muslims are quite traditional  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1398')">0:23:18</a> sexuality the place of uh intercourse uh within 
uh heterosexual marriage uh and gender roles    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1405')">0:23:25</a> are quite clearly defined and celebrated 
and accentuated rather than i don't know    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1410')">0:23:30</a> moved over in an egalitarian kind of mishmash 
of everyone is universally the same um but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1419')">0:23:39</a> am i right i'm thinking this is becoming a serious 
issue for muslims particularly those with children    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1424')">0:23:44</a> who are whose children have been who might say 
brainwashed by their teachers well yeah i don't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1430')">0:23:50</a> see it as a specifically muslim issue but i think 
it's something um that people who want to maintain    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1437')">0:23:57</a> the traditional idea of gender dimorphism 
which seems to be implicit in all the world's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1442')">0:24:02</a> scriptures you know taoism and hindu religion 
they all assume that reality is dyadic and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1448')">0:24:08</a> that the mysterium tremendous the mysterium 
fascinans are part of the nature of existence    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1453')">0:24:13</a> and it is through the interaction that the 
miracle of life comes about as you can see in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1458')">0:24:18</a> most of the species around us and that's kind 
of always assumed to be the case so but it is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1466')">0:24:26</a> and there are a lot of christians if you look 
at the organization christian concern they often    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1469')">0:24:29</a> champion individuals who who've been persecuted 
really that's the word because of what is now    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1475')">0:24:35</a> called heteronormativity so uh i mean i could 
mention a friend of mine somebody i consider    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1481')">0:24:41</a> a friend bernard randall who used to be chaplain 
of one of the colleges here in cambridge christ's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1486')">0:24:46</a> college um very decent guy mildly conservative 
evangelical perhaps but very open and courteous    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1495')">0:24:55</a> he got a job as re teacher at a school with an 
evangelical heritage and was overheard to indicate    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1507')">0:25:07</a> that according to the church of england marriage 
is between one man and one woman which is the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1514')">0:25:14</a> true isn't it that is the official teacher it is 
it's on their website so not only do they fire him    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1520')">0:25:20</a> but they also refer him to prevent can you imagine 
as if saying that the church of england says this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1527')">0:25:27</a> which is just a fact means that you're potentially 
a terrorist suspect well of course prevent they    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1533')">0:25:33</a> throw it out because they can see this is really 
didn't meet their threshold as it were but then    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1539')">0:25:39</a> and the kids in the school the conservative 
christians are saying is this a compulsory    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1543')">0:25:43</a> belief that heteronormativity is wrong and that we 
have to be against is it obligatory now and it's a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1553')">0:25:53</a> source of distress evidently for some of them and 
for that for their parents and and then bernard    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1560')">0:26:00</a> contacts to his supporters lambeth palace to find 
out what the archbishop of canterbury has to say    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1568')">0:26:08</a> about what is on the anglican church's website uh 
and um the archbishop of canterbury declines to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1577')">0:26:17</a> intervene and says well it's terribly complicated 
you know you have to understand all sides and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1582')">0:26:22</a> the usual prevarication so he won't defend his 
own priest and effectively throws him to the lions    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1590')">0:26:30</a> just for saying what the teaching of the church 
historically is and continues to be so that's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1595')">0:26:35</a> the you know christians are facing this as 
well but interestingly the same archbishop  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1602')">0:26:42</a> you may recall at the the battley 
cartoons scandal a few months ago    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1607')">0:26:47</a> when those outrageous cartoons were being 
brandished to muslim pupils in a in a school    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1612')">0:26:52</a> the archbishop said no i 
believe in freedom of speech  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1618')">0:26:58</a> look at this is the priority that lambeth 
palace seems to have now that muslim    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1622')">0:27:02</a> pupils can be offended but students who uh believe 
in heteronormativity just have to be smacked and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1629')">0:27:09</a> silenced that seems to be their view what why a 
particular point uh wellbeing the current article    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1635')">0:27:15</a> of the canterbury is that you know having to 
know that he comes from an evangelical background    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1639')">0:27:19</a> associated with htv holiday brompton in uh 
london which is a powerhouse of evangelical    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1647')">0:27:27</a> uh theology hugely popular with the middle 
classes in kensington and he comes from    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1652')">0:27:32</a> that very constituency and yet when he catches 
canterbury uh lo and behold he uh the uh my view    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1659')">0:27:39</a> the zeitgeist uh becomes his touchstone rather 
than his um his faith and um you know i don't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1667')">0:27:47</a> want to be rude about the man but i'm pretty 
uh madly i'm extremely disappointed and you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1672')">0:27:52</a> know if an evangelical archbishop of canterbury 
fails to stand up for his own church's preaching    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1678')">0:27:58</a> what hope is there for anyone and the thing is 
declines and declines and declines and you've said    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1683')">0:28:03</a> this before in other words that the only real uh 
monotheistic presence in europe that is standing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1689')">0:28:09</a> on its own legs is islam which is uh mostly i say 
mostly because of the fringes there are modernists    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1698')">0:28:18</a> who are um you know praising or you 
know all these lgbt whatever things but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1703')">0:28:23</a> most muslims are remaining steadfast it seems 
is that is that correct assessment uh it is the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1711')">0:28:31</a> case at least in western europe eastern europe 
has a very different more conservative logic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1717')">0:28:37</a> that if you go into a church you can't be quite 
sure what you're going to see or what you're    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1724')">0:28:44</a> going to hear yes and if you're in a parish 
you have to like it or lump it really um the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1735')">0:28:55</a> but it's also objectively the case that if 
you go into any mosque really any mosque    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1739')">0:28:59</a> in western europe you can be pretty sure that 
you'll see the liturgy that you expect to see    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1745')">0:29:05</a> and the sermon will be within some kind of 
bandwidth that is recognizably part of some    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1750')">0:29:10</a> sort of classical islamic broad consensus so i 
don't see it really as being about these sexuality    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1757')">0:29:17</a> issues but more about uh more about tradition 
and the courage to defend tradition because the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1766')">0:29:26</a> lgbt thing in islam has been dealt with in such a 
different way historically then it was dealt with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1772')">0:29:32</a> in christianity that you can't really apply the 
same kind of is it phobic is it not phobic it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1778')">0:29:38</a> it's more complex and nuanced than that and we 
don't really fit on that that spectrum at all    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1783')">0:29:43</a> um and obviously everybody has to be dealt 
with with compassion and and understanding    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1789')">0:29:49</a> but uh yeah the liturgy is is actually more 
central uh you can yeah any anywhere you go in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1796')">0:29:56</a> the world really there's 10 million mosques in 
the world 10 million mosques in the world yeah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1804')">0:30:04</a> in how many will you see something that really 
is a clear violation of something that's in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1811')">0:30:11</a> scriptures when you go for more prayers how 
many now there may be horrible fundamentalist    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1816')">0:30:16</a> extremist sermons there may be sermons dictated 
by regimes that people have to read out but still    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1826')">0:30:26</a> it will be canonically valid and that's the 
point so i've just looked through quite an    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1831')">0:30:31</a> interesting book it might be up your street 
or maybe you've seen it stephen bullivant    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1835')">0:30:35</a> mass exodus uh i've heard of it yes i i've 
had a review of it yeah yeah uh which is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1841')">0:30:41</a> basically it says catholic disaffiliation 
in britain and america since vatican ii    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1847')">0:30:47</a> uh it's about why it is that the catholic churches 
are emptying and nobody wants to be a priest any    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1852')">0:30:52</a> longer and the churches are all being closed and 
turned into condominiums or mosques or whatever    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1861')">0:31:01</a> and his conclusion is that it is partly because 
of vatican ii and partly because the church    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1866')">0:31:06</a> doesn't really seem to clearly maintain its 
traditional values he seems to suggest that young    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1872')">0:31:12</a> people will respect a religion more if it stays 
clear about its teachings even if they don't agree    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1879')">0:31:19</a> with those teachings then if it's kind of squishy 
and follows the zeitgeist in an anxious attempt to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1885')">0:31:25</a> hold on to young people's attention at all at 
all there is a problem here i i won't mention    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1891')">0:31:31</a> his name and i won't mention with mosque there 
is a um an imam of a very prominent london mosque    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1897')">0:31:37</a> um who gives the cutback on fridays obviously uh 
who told me uh in in confidence i'm not portraying    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1903')">0:31:43</a> the comment i'm not saying who he is or where he's 
from but the that he will not preach on friday on    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1910')">0:31:50</a> sexuality issues particularly on homosexuality for 
fear that the mosque will be invaded he'll be put    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1917')">0:31:57</a> on the register police will get interested now he 
is not if he is a he was born in this in england i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1924')">0:32:04</a> should say a highly intelligent man um he's a good 
good guy actually uh and that he knows that he was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1932')">0:32:12</a> thinking um that he will come under suspicion 
of the authorities and suffer consequences    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1939')">0:32:19</a> either from the state or from activists you know 
the old outrage mob will come in and destroy as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1943')">0:32:23</a> they have done and i've witnessed this in churches 
so people self-censor and don't preach on subjects    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1950')">0:32:30</a> yeah and and the issue of whether anti-zionism is 
anti-semitism is another one that a lot of muslims    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1957')">0:32:37</a> who are in exposed positions have to 
negotiate and we just have to recognize that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1961')">0:32:41</a> there isn't freedom of expression and let's 
be honest there isn't freedom of expression in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1966')">0:32:46</a> any muslim country either there's other ways other 
ways of tiptoeing through different minefields    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1971')">0:32:51</a> that happen if you're in egypt or saudi arabia 
it's not just the west that is censors by any    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1976')">0:32:56</a> means but if you're a minority you have to respect 
the local sanctities and these nowadays are quite    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1983')">0:33:03</a> different to those which christianity historically 
acknowledged but um we're still you know allowed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1988')">0:33:08</a> to preach on 99 of what is significant so uh i see 
it just as a matter of courtesy really right all    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1996')">0:33:16</a> right interesting so in terms of the question 
of hydra which is on some people's mind so i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2001')">0:33:21</a> brought this up with a uh professor uh uh from 
zaytuna a week or two ago professor abdullah ali    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2008')">0:33:28</a> he was american and and he'd and asked him about 
hidra and he given the pressure it's an increasing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2013')">0:33:33</a> hostile environment that many muslims feel they're 
in in the west and and many of these people have    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2018')">0:33:38</a> children you know who are being educated in these 
um woke values which are inimicable to traditional    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2024')">0:33:44</a> faith be it christian or muslim or i mean 
fascinatingly never occurred to me that you know    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2030')">0:33:50</a> if you're in california you're not a muslim yeah 
you can do hitra within america it's a federal    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2035')">0:33:55</a> you know huge vast continent with many different 
nation states so move to a republican area where    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2042')">0:34:02</a> traditional values are respected and many of these 
traditional christian republicans are actually not    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2047')">0:34:07</a> islamophobic as the media would uh have you 
believe and i didn't know that so uh his answer    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2054')">0:34:14</a> was you don't have to literally leave the west 
you can move within the west to a more safe and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2060')">0:34:20</a> welcoming would you agree with that or would you 
see hidra as a serious consideration for muslims    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2065')">0:34:25</a> well um america is certainly not britain it's 
not obvious that there's a place in britain to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2070')">0:34:30</a> which you could migrate if you don't want 
your children to be indoctrinated with the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2075')">0:34:35</a> latest state beliefs but there are problems 
in the us of course do you really want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2084')">0:34:44</a> go past a lot of trump banners and posters every 
time you go to work um that is also a problematic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2094')">0:34:54</a> view but it is it is the case that even though 
many muslims think that the evangelicals    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2099')">0:34:59</a> are kind of hell-bent on zionism and the 
destruction of muslims everywhere that once    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2105')">0:35:05</a> you get to know those people you find that most 
of them are actually very reasonable and once    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2109')">0:35:09</a> they learn what muslims actually are and they 
visit the mosque they can be good neighbors so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2115')">0:35:15</a> uh it is an option and california of course has 
always been kind of at the edge of the earth you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2119')">0:35:19</a> know you feel like you've got to fall off if 
you go any further uh it's a kind of extreme    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2125')">0:35:25</a> that there's there's other places um where people 
can move to in north america and i think there's a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2131')">0:35:31</a> very strong case nowadays for inter-religious 
alliances on these issues of conscience    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2137')">0:35:37</a> that people do feel persecuted that they feel that 
their freedom of speech is being impugned that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2142')">0:35:42</a> their children are being indoctrinated against 
their will and uh there's there's plenty of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2150')">0:35:50</a> opportunities for forging alliances with 
conservative jewish uh traditions as well as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2155')">0:35:55</a> with uh traditional questions also for places 
like africa for instance where this is also    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2161')">0:36:01</a> beginning to be an issue so you know 
but of course we can't do that in europe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2166')">0:36:06</a> unless of course you want to go and live in 
victor oregon's hungary which is perhaps a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2171')">0:36:11</a> mixed blessing um because very often conservatism 
in europe tends really does go hand in hand with a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2178')">0:36:18</a> furious kind of matamoros islamophobia um and 
that kind of partly because it tends to be less    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2185')">0:36:25</a> religious i think in a certain interesting way 
it's easier for us to persuade and engage with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2191')">0:36:31</a> kitab than to deal with people who are just 
secular atheists nationalist races to believe in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2198')">0:36:38</a> a darwinian kind of natural selection that has 
made the white man the top of of of a billion    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2204')">0:36:44</a> years of evolution it's hard to engage with them 
but with people who are significantly part of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2209')">0:36:49</a> kitab there's always grounds for discussion 
but what about the home school i mean i'm not    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2214')">0:36:54</a> a parent myself so this is kind of outside of my 
particular area but what about homeschooling for    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2218')">0:36:58</a> muslim parents is this a serious uh possibility 
in terms of avoiding the the worst excesses of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2224')">0:37:04</a> yeah a lot of people do this it may well be the 
case that the various inquisitors who inspect    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2231')">0:37:11</a> homeschooling groups and programs will insist 
also on the inculcation of these new beliefs in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2238')">0:37:18</a> very young children because it's 
become such a passionate orthodoxy    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2242')">0:37:22</a> for a culture that i think has been starved of 
certainties for so long that has become a kind of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2248')">0:37:28</a> secular religion somehow that delighted that 
they found truths after all and everything was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2252')">0:37:32</a> relativistic this is absolutely true they 
think and of course they proselytize with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2257')">0:37:37</a> all the zeal of the fundamentalist converts so 
uh and in countries like france homeschooling    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2263')">0:37:43</a> has been shut down that may well be the 
pattern for many other european countries    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2269')">0:37:49</a> liberalism is increasingly becoming intolerant 
uh which might seem like a contradiction in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2274')">0:37:54</a> terms but it's what we're seeing now a coercive 
liberalism is becoming imposed i know christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2280')">0:38:00</a> are talking about muscular christianity and they 
they really mean is to dominate muslims and and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2285')">0:38:05</a> force them into submission but so you don't see 
hydra in terms of the physical leaving of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2291')">0:38:11</a> muslim majority countries as a particularly 
obvious option well where is there a place that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2298')">0:38:18</a> is a particularly appetizing destination right now 
i don't know however you tell me where we've been    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2305')">0:38:25</a> i would i mean indonesia is one of my favorite 
countries i certainly wouldn't mind living in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2311')">0:38:31</a> a little traditional village there eating mangoes 
and paddling in the sea and just being being happy    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2318')">0:38:38</a> going to the mosque i like indonesia a lot but 
then in my case what on what use would i be though    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2328')">0:38:48</a> my skills are rather specialized uh so uh 
yeah i i hang on here uh in the hope that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2336')">0:38:56</a> you know really the only justification for muslims 
living in the west is the dawah justification    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2340')">0:39:00</a> everything else is very dodgy and the first 
hadith of islam beginning of bukhari is the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2346')">0:39:06</a> hadith of hijrah which is also the hadith of niya 
now that's a big thing if you make hijra for dunya    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2354')">0:39:14</a> dunya will eat you alive basically and you can 
see the effect on your children and grandchildren    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2362')">0:39:22</a> yeah both muslims come to the whites historically 
they're not for uh hindu purposes not for a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2367')">0:39:27</a> sincere desire to spread islam but for economic 
reasons yeah and that is not haram in islam    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2374')">0:39:34</a> uh but it's i think it's time now for a near 
reset for muslims in europe why are we here    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2382')">0:39:42</a> because nia intention is enormously important 
in terms of divine acceptance and the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2387')">0:39:47</a> our inner spiritual health what 
on earth am i doing here in this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2391')">0:39:51</a> weird place uh well i'm here to help people you 
know to be rahmatum and says a mercy under healing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">0:40:00</a> not so that i can save up for a big new car allah 
may still help me if that's my main object in life    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2408')">0:40:08</a> but may not but if my intention actually is to 
help my neighbors and to spread truth and to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2414')">0:40:14</a> try and bring people to mercy respect for family 
neighborhood looking out for wild animals in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2421')">0:40:21</a> animal shelter or whatever just helping to to show 
mercy then that's a legitimate nia and i think    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2427')">0:40:27</a> if that is strongly our near then there isn't 
really a a duty of of emigration in our time    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2434')">0:40:34</a> right okay finally then if we may come to um 
our scene in the united kingdom um which i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2443')">0:40:43</a> have observed to small extent close up um how 
would you character is it a healthy state uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2449')">0:40:49</a> i mean and what have you observed in terms of dow 
activity in in britain well you probably have been    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2456')">0:40:56</a> more at the front line than i have i tend to hide 
behind the stacks in the university library and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2462')">0:41:02</a> speak from a distance i mean there's two 
sides to it there is the natural human    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2470')">0:41:10</a> thirst for truth and for beauty and for 
god and for hope and that is still there    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2477')">0:41:17</a> despite the fact that everybody is so rushed off 
their feet and checking their texts and doing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2482')">0:41:22</a> things too fast that it's hard really for their 
souls to experience that contemplative faculty    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2488')">0:41:28</a> as it's as it's supposed to once people calm down 
a little bit or perhaps after they've had some big    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2494')">0:41:34</a> misfortune in their lives they do recognize 
that they need meaning and truth and islamic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2501')">0:41:41</a> monotheism is has all the virtues of monotheism 
which is certainly history's most powerful idea    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2508')">0:41:48</a> but without many of the complexities that are 
identified with historically evolved christianity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2516')">0:41:56</a> there has been a shift in the churches as 
you've noticed away from some of the classical    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2521')">0:42:01</a> formulations and towards something that is more 
kind of generically unitarian i was invited by a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2528')">0:42:08</a> a friend of mine dr fraser watts a admirable 
person to uh preach at his church when he was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2535')">0:42:15</a> vicar of saint edwards in cambridge yes to his 
congregation it's a nice hospitable invitation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2542')">0:42:22</a> and i preached from ridley's pulpit the pulpit 
that launched the english reformation if you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2546')">0:42:26</a> think certainly it was it wasn't mistake or 
something or sorry wasn't he burned at the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2552')">0:42:32</a> stake or something yeah he ended up um getting 
into uh getting into trouble with the marion    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2558')">0:42:38</a> yeah you have spared that but still there i 
was i mean i wasn't likely to start a kind of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2564')">0:42:44</a> new reformation with a sort of couple of dozen 
silvery headed parishioners that were trying to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2570')">0:42:50</a> hear me in the church but afterwards we sat down 
and we talked about one of the real differences    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2575')">0:42:55</a> between islam and christianity and i said well we 
do respect jesus and we respect his sainted mother    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2581')">0:43:01</a> but we don't believe that he was god and they 
said well we don't either we believe he was a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2588')">0:43:08</a> wonderful human being but we don't understand 
how he could have been god at the same time    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2592')">0:43:12</a> so without douwer in a sense that that journey 
towards what makes sense is already well underway    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2599')">0:43:19</a> yes yes um and one doesn't have to get too angry 
and polemical and if you are that people tend    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2605')">0:43:25</a> to get angry and polemical back it's kind of 
aggression is usually counterproductive again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2614')">0:43:34</a> say to people what is most beautiful and 
that doesn't mean using four letter words and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2619')">0:43:39</a> youtube chat boxes that's not the way to melt 
hearts really um that that just exacerbates the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2625')">0:43:45</a> ego which is what we're trying to get beyond so 
you know people are joining islam quietly we get    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2633')">0:43:53</a> about one conversion a week registered at our 
main mosque in cambridge which i used to think    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2639')">0:43:59</a> was amazing but last week i met somebody else who 
said at his mosque in london they get a similar    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2643')">0:44:03</a> number so we'll have to look at what the census 
return looks like when they've crunched the data    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2650')">0:44:10</a> that they got a couple of months ago but for 
the previous census they reckon there's about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2654')">0:44:14</a> a hundred thousand converts to islam in britain 
a hundred thousand yep and that you can correlate    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2659')">0:44:19</a> by looking at the number of people who click 
the box muslim but also click the box that says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2667')">0:44:27</a> white anglo-saxon irish or whatever you put 
those together that's the number you get to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2673')">0:44:33</a> and i expect it'll be a larger number this time 
but that happens really without da'wah it happens    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2680')">0:44:40</a> just because people are looking for what is 
they find something in islam something about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2688')">0:44:48</a> its timelessness they like the form of worship 
they like the uncluttered simplicity of the mosque    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2693')">0:44:53</a> they love the fact that muslims united in their 
ibadah and that it's uncompromising ramadan is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2701')">0:45:01</a> difficult but impressive five daily prayers 
difficult but impressive there's a seriousness    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2707')">0:45:07</a> about it that makes them think well this 
is this is a real religion this looks like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2710')">0:45:10</a> god's religion because it's not constantly 
being sweetened and diluted by anxious synods  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2723')">0:45:23</a> the reception of the eucharist the the central 
part of the church on a sunday usually one has to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2729')">0:45:29</a> fast yeah from for a whole hour whole 60 minutes 
um um from food yeah and uh i i know i'm not let    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2740')">0:45:40</a> me say that to mock but i'm just juxtaposing that 
with um the realities of ramadan and the uh yeah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2747')">0:45:47</a> and you know anyway it's just how different 
things are yeah i think that uh those things    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2754')">0:45:54</a> which make people shake their heads why don't we 
get with it and become modern and like everybody    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2760')">0:46:00</a> else are those things that are quite irresistibly 
attractive to a lot of seriously minded people    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2769')">0:46:09</a> which is why you know the mosques are full 
everybody's talking about the crisis of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2773')">0:46:13</a> islam well we do have a lot of crises but if 
the church where my ancestors used to worship    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2780')">0:46:20</a> in norwich is now a mosque is it well which 
religion is in crisis yeah there's one thing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2788')">0:46:28</a> i've always known is the most the problem 
with the most is they're always twofold  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2793')">0:46:33</a> there's always two and the age of the average age 
of the attendant is very young the average age of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2799')">0:46:39</a> your average church of england or roman catholic 
church is the opposite um we're talking about as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2804')">0:46:44</a> you say lots of gray hairs yeah that's the typical 
um story tonight yeah it's very uh you know jummah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2814')">0:46:54</a> prayer is crowded and it's a dynamic event and 
leila in a mosque is overcrowded in an even more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2821')">0:47:01</a> sensational event and people people take that 
seriously so it's kind of self-perpetuating and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2827')">0:47:07</a> i see no sign of that really flagging anywhere in 
europe right there's places in albania that were    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2834')">0:47:14</a> subject to communist forced secularization for 
so many decades that people have forgotten what a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2841')">0:47:21</a> mosque is for where things are flagging a bit but 
really you have to adopt the inquisition approach    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2848')">0:47:28</a> islam prevailed in spain after the muslim 
conquest within a hundred years most people    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2853')">0:47:33</a> had converted after the christian reconquest of 
spain it took them hundreds of years to winkle    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2860')">0:47:40</a> out the last pockets of muslimness and they had 
to use the inquisition with all of its horror    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2866')">0:47:46</a> and you know they were still discovering 
muslims in spain in the 18th century um    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2873')">0:47:53</a> so a friend of mine who lives in granada recently 
had his house uh rebuilt and the builders found    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2880')">0:48:00</a> on the ground floor a couple of 
skeletons that were facing the qibla    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2886')">0:48:06</a> they were thought to be 18th century so that 
family had kept up the traditions in secret    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2891')">0:48:11</a> risking being burnt at the stake for for many 
generations so that's the kind of resilience of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2896')">0:48:16</a> islam it doesn't die away quickly because 
it it's it's the religion of fitra people    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2902')">0:48:22</a> love the idea of monotheism they love the idea 
of a timeless beautiful simple quite short form    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2908')">0:48:28</a> of worship um what's not to like of course on the 
surface you have the taliban and isis and crisis    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2915')">0:48:35</a> after crisis which is what the media tend to 
report but um it's it's a kind of mirror image of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2921')">0:48:41</a> the west in the west on the surface everything is 
nice but underneath you have a demographic crisis    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2929')">0:48:49</a> you have the environmental crisis you have uh the 
crisis of loneliness we now have the world's first    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2937')">0:48:57</a> minister of loneliness in the uk really i didn't 
know yeah because society is fraying so fast so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2944')">0:49:04</a> that's the society into which muslims 
are being invited to integrate yeah so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2951')">0:49:11</a> there's certain things that are still rough 
and ready but still more or less functional    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2956')">0:49:16</a> the muslim family the muslim neighborhood the 
place of worship the idea of gender these things    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2961')">0:49:21</a> are still maintained despite everything but the 
surface of course which the media reports this is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2967')">0:49:27</a> uproar constant uproar but beneath 
the surface there's stillness    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2971')">0:49:31</a> but what about i mean i don't need to go on this 
is a separate subject i don't want to go into it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2975')">0:49:35</a> or now but but what about the second generation 
the third generation of muslim immigrants    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2980')">0:49:40</a> uh uh the the the offspring of them are they 
retaining the faith or are they hemorrhaging    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2985')">0:49:45</a> all over the place and will disappear you know 
water in the sand or will they will they will    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2990')">0:49:50</a> they retain there well in the book i do talk a 
little bit about retention and there's been some    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2996')">0:49:56</a> sociological work done on it so uh 26 percent of 
christian parents statistically can expect their    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3005')">0:50:05</a> children to be church goers if they are church 
goers 26 in the case of muslims it's 71 percent    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3013')">0:50:13</a> which is not not a hundred percent but still 
a rate of survival plus the converts plus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3020')">0:50:20</a> big families means that the mosques are likely 
to be well used for some time to come so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3027')">0:50:27</a> yeah retention rates but of course there's part 
of the problem is that the culture of many mosques    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3033')">0:50:33</a> in england reflects the cultural needs and focus 
of first generation migrant communities who came    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3040')">0:50:40</a> not so much with islam but with their culture 
yeah and that's fine for the first generation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3046')">0:50:46</a> but the second generation which has been to 
british schools and has a kind of british soul    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3050')">0:50:50</a> effectively uh may not feel particularly at home 
in those spaces and the khutbas may not be very    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3057')">0:50:57</a> relevant and that's the danger really that in 
islam we have this idea of local custom which is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3064')">0:51:04</a> a valid and respected thing as long as it doesn't 
violate something in the quran of the sunnah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3070')">0:51:10</a> but if you have the orf of somewhere else    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3074')">0:51:14</a> and you're expecting young people with their own 
local orf to relate harmoniously to that then    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3079')">0:51:19</a> you have a cognitive dissonance that can result in 
disaffiliation and i think that's the main problem    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3085')">0:51:25</a> that people find the mosques exotic kind of spaces 
where an overseas beauty is maintained rather than    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3093')">0:51:33</a> something that speaks to the kind of questions 
that they're having to ask here's written    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3098')">0:51:38</a> on that point about earth probably mispronouncing 
culture am i right thinking that that concept uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3105')">0:51:45</a> is an important element to sharia itself 
that it recognizes the legitimacy uh and uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3112')">0:51:52</a> and value of a culture and it might not be an 
arabic culture or a paganism it could be a british    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3118')">0:51:58</a> an english culture is actually explicitly uh as 
long as it can you know it doesn't violate sure    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3125')">0:52:05</a> alcohol abuse or pornography or loneliness we're 
talking about those positive aspects of culture    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3131')">0:52:11</a> are recognized by the sharia is that right yeah 
and this is part of the universalism and you know    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3136')">0:52:16</a> part of the the beautiful wisdom of islam is 
just as even though it makes strong prophetic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3144')">0:52:24</a> points against the ahlul kitab because that's what 
prophecy does it still is very generous it still    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3153')">0:52:33</a> says lace or they're not all the same amongst 
them is a community that is upright it tells us    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3158')">0:52:38</a> to be respectful to them that's part of you know 
the unique brilliance of the quran amongst other    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3164')">0:52:44</a> prophetic documents and that it's respectful 
even though it comes as a kind of repair    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3171')">0:52:51</a> similarly where islam has traveled historically 
if you look at what it's done to the literatures    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3177')">0:52:57</a> of the peoples that it has touched uh it 
doesn't replace them with a kind of uniform    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3183')">0:53:03</a> arabiness but actually triggers or galvanizes 
a new flourishing in those literatures    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3189')">0:53:09</a> if you look at persian literature yes before 
islam while it's a few afterstand prayers and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3195')">0:53:15</a> incantations to various kings it's not much then 
islam comes and you have hafiz and rumi and saudi    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3203')">0:53:23</a> and it's uh but in farsi so it tends to feckin 
date the local uh and it's the same with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3211')">0:53:31</a> turkish literature which before islam was really 
nothing at all um many of the literatures of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3216')">0:53:36</a> subcontinent of west africa and so forth so it's a 
principle that while uncompromising about tawheed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3225')">0:53:45</a> and about the inviolability of the basic sacred 
forms you don't introduce local customs into your    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3231')">0:53:51</a> federal prayer for instance and nobody would would 
have the temerity to do that that's universal    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3238')">0:53:58</a> that at the same time uh in terms of the 
more informal aspects of people's lives    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3243')">0:54:03</a> how they dress what they eat the language 
they use and also in their literature and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3248')">0:54:08</a> perhaps some of their extra economical rituals 
in say the context of sufism you'll find that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3254')">0:54:14</a> local socialities and local languages tend 
to be uplifted and this is why orpheus none    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3261')">0:54:21</a> of this is controversial it's there in all of the 
classical texts of sharia a maxim of the sharia is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3272')">0:54:32</a> which is to say that which is known through 
local custom is like that which is legislated    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3278')">0:54:38</a> by revelation wow which some people nowadays 
with the kind of rather limited view that they    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3284')">0:54:44</a> have of islam find startling but uh that and 
that's particularly effective in terms of what    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3291')">0:54:51</a> he does in a law court he'll look at the books 
of sharia but he'll also look at what the local    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3296')">0:54:56</a> custom is and if that customer is not violating 
something that's known in revelation in which case    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3302')">0:55:02</a> it has to shut up and die if he's not violating 
that then that becomes islam for those people    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3310')">0:55:10</a> and so the challenge for us in the west is 
to see whether we are going to use the orf of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3318')">0:55:18</a> indonesia in holland or kurdistan in sweden and 
that's how we have to be as muslims or whether    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3326')">0:55:26</a> the traditional enculturation that the ummah has 
always been pretty good at is going to be possible    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3333')">0:55:33</a> for us in modern europe so what should a mosque 
in sweden look like for instance well should it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3339')">0:55:39</a> look like a turkish mosque or a moroccan mosque 
or a kurdish mosque most of them do that and that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3344')">0:55:44</a> can be quite divisive because it cements ethnic 
divisions in the community which are weakening    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3350')">0:55:50</a> but what about what would a swedish mosque 
look like and how would a swedish imam dress    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3357')">0:55:57</a> and what kind of poetry islamic poetry 
would you want to write using the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3362')">0:56:02</a> particular genius and strengths of the swedish 
language and that's something that is starting now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3369')">0:56:09</a> it has to be uh convert-led presumably it can't 
be well not necessarily if you look at some of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3376')">0:56:16</a> sort of rather dutch looking mosques in holland 
now in rotterdam for instance a very interesting    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3381')">0:56:21</a> big mosque in rotterdam which draws a lot on 
dutch styles of architecture that's not primarily    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3388')">0:56:28</a> convert lead that's led by so i think that the 
the differentiation that one saw between the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3395')">0:56:35</a> converts and the cradle muslims if you like 
in the 80s and 90s is starting to die away    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3400')">0:56:40</a> right um i think it may be that the age of 
the convert is coming to an end really and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3405')">0:56:45</a> that we're going to see this new generation really 
powering ahead which will be i think a good thing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3412')">0:56:52</a> and it is often like in our mosque 
in cambridge which tries to be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3416')">0:56:56</a> british as well as islamic in various ways 
using local british patterns of brickwork and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3423')">0:57:03</a> gothic vaulting and so forth that's been very 
strongly supported by the local community which is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3430')">0:57:10</a> bangladeshi turkish and so forth once it's 
explained to them that this is a way of being    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3434')">0:57:14</a> courteous to your neighbors you don't really 
want a mosque that they experience as an insult    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3440')">0:57:20</a> it has to be courteous as long as it's 
not violating something in the scripture    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3445')">0:57:25</a> what's wrong with courtesy and courtesy is 
is an islamic virtue it's something of course    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3451')">0:57:31</a> i've talked about endlessly this is not some 
kind of english gentleman virtue this is an    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3456')">0:57:36</a> islamic virtue as well yeah it's neighboriness 
yeah so um somebody once came to the holy prophet    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3462')">0:57:42</a> sallallahu alaihi wasallam offering 
him some stew and his reply was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3471')">0:57:51</a> have you offered some to your jewish neighbor so 
this idea of neighbourliness which is very big    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3477')">0:57:57</a> in islam doesn't just mean muslim neighbors but 
also non-muslim neighbors and this is something    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3483')">0:58:03</a> that you can see again and again in this era 
um so uh yeah the the the public statements of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3490')">0:58:10</a> islam's presence have to be if we're sensible 
respectful rather than irritants yeah uh i was    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3499')">0:58:19</a> recently uh looking at the speech of the mayor of 
pech i think it is in southern hungary for some    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3508')">0:58:28</a> oraban's party anti-immigrant building fences and 
so forth and there's a historic mosque in petrus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3515')">0:58:35</a> which was built by the ottomans and 
the interviewer was saying well we've    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3519')">0:58:39</a> got the muslim community here why don't 
you allow the mosque to open up again    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3524')">0:58:44</a> and he said no no because they have different 
traditions they dress differently and they eat    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3529')">0:58:49</a> food that's very different from ours and he named 
all of the things that have nothing to do with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3533')">0:58:53</a> islam as a religion but to do with the orf of 
recently arrived people as he understands it so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3539')">0:58:59</a> very often islamophobia fixes on superficial 
things that are religiously dispensable anyway    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3545')">0:59:05</a> so i'm in the longer term quite optimistic 
because you see with the new generation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3549')">0:59:09</a> certainly the third generation they're really 
very french and swedish i was talking to a guy in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3555')">0:59:15</a> um cologne recently there's a huge new mosque 
there and as you go into the mosque the sign    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3562')">0:59:22</a> says turkish mosque turkish mosque on 
every door a big sign turkish mosque    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3568')">0:59:28</a> the turks are maybe 50 of the muslims of 
cologne but they wanted to make this statement    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3575')">0:59:35</a> and there's a bookshop but it has books in turkish 
all books in german all translated from turkish    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3580')">0:59:40</a> you know the kind of scene and this young guy even 
though he's the second generation his parents at    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3586')">0:59:46</a> turkish says i'm german i'm not turkish yeah 
so i don't really feel that that's my place    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3593')">0:59:53</a> and there's going to be more and more people 
like that and as the mosques make the transition    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3598')">0:59:58</a> which is pretty easy to do in many ways 
because you don't have to change the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3602')">1:00:02</a> abada or any of the essential functions from 
being a place of refuge for first generation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3609')">1:00:09</a> understandably kind of defensive communities to 
something that's more open and our oriented then    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3615')">1:00:15</a> you'll see not just the younger generation feeling 
more at home in the mosque but also more and more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3619')">1:00:19</a> non-muslims coming to the mosque recognizing 
islam for what it is and inshallah joining us so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3625')">1:00:25</a> in the longer term i'm pretty optimistic i 
i'm very pleased to hear this uh optimistic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3631')">1:00:31</a> uh prognosis for the future um i i'm just very 
fine are you working on anything yourself in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3636')">1:00:36</a> terms of uh books or articles or lectures that 
we might look forward to well i'm i have various    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3646')">1:00:46</a> sort of projects up my sleeve one of them 
that i'd really like to do although it might    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3650')">1:00:50</a> be quite a short book is a book on life the 
principle of life and all that it means because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3659')">1:00:59</a> all of the the basic scientific presumptions 
about how the world came to be and why it is the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3666')">1:01:06</a> way it is are arguable and mysterious the big bang 
mystery where did the physical constants come from    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3674')">1:01:14</a> mystery uh where did life come from what is life 
mystery where does consciousness come from what    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3682')">1:01:22</a> is consciousness mystery religion answers those 
things pretty well secularity is really struggling    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3689')">1:01:29</a> it's kind of agnostic so life is one of 
the big mysteries and it seems to me that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3694')">1:01:34</a> the quran is very much a celebration of life it 
says not just look at the sky and the mountains    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3701')">1:01:41</a> but at the living things and all of those 
beautiful hadiths about kindness to animals    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3706')">1:01:46</a> uh which is not there in the new testament really 
it's not much about animals though there's unless    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3712')">1:01:52</a> you count the episode of the gadarene swine 
which is perhaps not a kind of ideal proof    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3717')">1:01:57</a> text for animal rights activists i don't know but 
um the one of the different things about islam is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3724')">1:02:04</a> this valorizing of the the natural world and 
it's a very beautiful joyful thing because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3730')">1:02:10</a> of course nature is indicative of transcendence 
uh and gender of course comes into that because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3735')">1:02:15</a> life comes into being by and large through 
the interaction of alternate principles  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3744')">1:02:24</a> recent discovery uh not just dna but actually 
actually you know um within the human cell or all    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3750')">1:02:30</a> cells actually is biological machines now that's 
the term that biologists use not me calling them    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3756')">1:02:36</a> biological machines and these are extraordinarily 
complex pieces of scenery in the naked eye but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3762')">1:02:42</a> they're there within living organisms incredibly 
complex tasks to do with the duplication of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3769')">1:02:49</a> cell and creation of dna and so on i'm looking 
at this i'm thinking good grief you know i mean    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3774')">1:02:54</a> if that's not designed what is i i and uh it 
kind of cries out for a transcendent explanation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3781')">1:03:01</a> i've got an atheist friend of mine who uh has 
uh some scientific background i said how does    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3787')">1:03:07</a> on your materialist darwinian uh explanation 
how do you account for this he said oh i'm sure    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3793')">1:03:13</a> it's been explained and he's never actually been 
able to present me anything that hasn't explained    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3797')">1:03:17</a> this extraordinary complex machinery which we can 
observe that does incredibly complex computer-like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3804')">1:03:24</a> tasks that's supposedly a product of random 
materialistic evolution i mean it's amazing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3810')">1:03:30</a> i think yeah i think it's it's a youtube clip even 
the inner life of the cell or something that comes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3814')">1:03:34</a> from harvard which is mind-blowing particularly 
when you consider that there's several billions    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3819')">1:03:39</a> of them in every one of us so you know it's a 
good example of the fact that atheism is more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3826')">1:03:46</a> a leap of faith and more speculative and i think 
more ego driven than monotheism um you know but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3835')">1:03:55</a> unfortunately we live in an age of the wrong kind 
of fundamentalism and we're up against a kind of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3840')">1:04:00</a> really unreflective anger because people in their 
egotistic cells really don't want to self-identify    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3846')">1:04:06</a> as religious because that's not cool they think 
they'll be socially blanked and cancelled and that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3852')">1:04:12</a> it's a kind of fear of that but yeah the cell 
is is a miracle every organ of the body is is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3857')">1:04:17</a> an extraordinary miracle yeah and it makes 
sense that there is an ordering principle    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3864')">1:04:24</a> because you don't need to be a philosopher 
to realize that principles of subtle order    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3869')">1:04:29</a> uh are not intrinsic in the nature of 
chaos and nothingness british philosopher  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3879')">1:04:39</a> a flu professor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3882')">1:04:42</a> who spent decades uh very eminent academic at uh 
as well uh arguing against um theism against god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3890')">1:04:50</a> as an atheist and towards the end of life he 
maintained complete consistency he argues in his    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3896')">1:04:56</a> book his consistency where's the evidence taking 
me and he argued that the evidence now took him    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3902')">1:05:02</a> to belief in god because science was uncovering 
the most extraordinary the universe i mean he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3908')">1:05:08</a> referenced dna uh and and not the fine-tuning 
of the universe so he became a believer in god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3916')">1:05:16</a> in the last few years of his life having spent an 
entire lifetime arguing for the truth of atheism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3922')">1:05:22</a> purely he said on the basis of science now 
whether or not that's i think that's the fit    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3927')">1:05:27</a> fitra kicking in ultimately but he felt there was 
good reason to believe in god now especially now    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3933')">1:05:33</a> and this is why the quran when it speaks of 
unbelief and error speaks of it in terms of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3940')">1:05:40</a> in other words whims or passions it's the ego and 
the lack of self-knowledge that puts people in a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3947')">1:05:47</a> position where they end up believing in complete 
absurdities that the subtlety of shakespeare for    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3953')">1:05:53</a> instance is possible in a completely random 
universe whose existence is itself a kind of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3959')">1:05:59</a> bizarre impossibility but yeah we live in an 
age where i think it's it's theists like you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3966')">1:06:06</a> and me who are the skeptics because we're just 
skeptical of the idea that all of this order and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3972')">1:06:12</a> beauty and symmetry and all of those 50 or so 
physical constants just pop up out of the primal    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3979')">1:06:19</a> void we're kind of a bit cynical about that and 
they're they're the those who have taken the leap    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3985')">1:06:25</a> of blind faith and i think ultimately that's why 
monotheism in one shape or another will prevail    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3991')">1:06:31</a> and people again when the ego is set aside and 
they have a contemplative dimension will recognize    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3996')">1:06:36</a> that the beauty of islam at its forms once the 
kind of matamoros cry has subsided and some of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4004')">1:06:44</a> veiling bad habits of the muslims are set aside 
um islam is is a is really trumps everything else    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4011')">1:06:51</a> in my experience wow that's a beautiful um finale 
there um and uh just thank you so much sir for uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4020')">1:07:00</a> your precious time and i know the viewers 
of whom there will be many i'm sure will    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4025')">1:07:05</a> learn hugely from uh what you've said and um i i 
do recommend uh your latest book traveling home    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4031')">1:07:11</a> essays on islam in europe it's a challenging read 
but um based i think on a series of electives and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4038')">1:07:18</a> talks on different occasions that we've given um 
but um there's a lot of uh many gems in there i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4044')">1:07:24</a> think to to ponder uh for people for those people 
who think i think that's a chronic expression for    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4050')">1:07:30</a> those who reflect and think that that's the 
material there so um thank you so much for    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4055')">1:07:35</a> your time sir and um i wish you well thank 
you for your time thank you bless you okay
