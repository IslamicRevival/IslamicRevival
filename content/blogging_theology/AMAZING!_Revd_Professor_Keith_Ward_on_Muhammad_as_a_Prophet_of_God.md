[0:00:00](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=0) What do you as a Christian theologian 
make of the prophethood of Muhammad?    
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=5) Do you have any thoughts about that?  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=10) I do think Muhammad was a genuine 
Prophet of God and that he was raised up by God    
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=18) and that the Quran is in some way an expression 
of God's Revelation. So I do think that  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=33) I am a Christian, I'm a follower of Jesus, 
so clearly I'm not a Muslim but    
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=39) I would I think I'm totally opposed to people who 
misunderstand Islam as a rejection of Christianity.    
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=49) I think that is not true. I think Islam would as 
I see it and Muhammad I don't think he knew much    
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=56) about Christianity. I would have thought he was 
opposed to some of the views of Christians that he    
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=62) knew about and I think that's true, but I don't 
hold any of those views. In fact and none of my    
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=68) colleagues do. So there are differences, 
I mean there are clear differences but I   
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=76) think he was a genuine, Muhammed was a genuine Prophet 
of one God who stand against a sort of    
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=87) popularized Christian version of there being three    
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=91) gods or let's see three different things in god, 
was correct he was justified in this so I    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=99) see the difference between 
a school of Islam and a school of Christianity has    
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=107) about the same sort of difference as a difference 
between me and conservative Evangelical Christians.    
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=117) That there are differences I can live with those 
I can respect those who differ from me and I    
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=124) think we have so I am not infallible so I'm 
not saying that I know that I'm right, to use    
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=131) an expression from the Quran 'God will decide 
who is right' but you have to go along with your    
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=137) own feelings so I follow Jesus because I 
think he was a human expression of the wisdom    
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=146) and love of God and the main message of that 
is that God loves without exception everyone.    
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=154) There are Christians who don't believe that, there 
are Muslims who do believe that, right but wouldn't    
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=161) use words like Incarnation or the Trinity etc some 
certain forbidden terms but if you accept that    
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=170) religious language is fluid and that all of us are 
unable to comprehend the nature of God precisely    
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=179) I think islam and Christianity shouldn't 
really be regarded as two different religions. I    
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=185) think they're two different ways of approaching 
God and I'm nearer to many Muslims than I am    
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=193) to many Christians. So that's a very interesting 
answer can I ask this question it's really    
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=200) really on behalf of i know some of the muslim 
viewers audience will want me to ask this.    
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=206) Muslims also have a very high regard for Jesus 
clearly yes and see him as a an incredibly    
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=214) wonderful human being who expressed the love of 
God to the outcasts and the sinners and so on and    
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=219) and that's all wonderful, so your admiration for 
Jesus is shared by Muslims too, or they may be    
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=227) expressed slightly differently of course. He's 
not seen as an Icon into God that we pray through    
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=232) of course but they would wonder the question 
would be 'Why aren't you a Muslim?' If you accept it    
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=240) in that mindset if you accept that Muhammad 
is a prophet of God and you believe in one god    
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=245) god sent jesus that is virtually a definition of 
what a muslim believes anyway um so they would    
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=252) ask why aren't you a muslim and and saying 
you're a christian is not an answer because    
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=257) for the reasons you mentioned muslims can already 
encompass that understanding as well that he    
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=261) is someone who expresses the love of God to 
you and the wisdom of God in a    
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=265) very special way, you know many sufi muslims could 
say yeah absolutely we agree with you but we're    
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=270) muslims so the question is 'Why are you not 
a Muslim?' That's the question. Well it's like    
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=276) asking me why i'm an Anglican or an Episcopalian 
rather than a Methodist um because that's the way    
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=287) of thinking of God which has i feel demanded 
my loyalty. So it's a bit like saying why    
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=299) do you uh prefer one view of philosophy to another 
view of philosophy and you say well because    
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=308) that that's the way that seems right to me that 
attracts me to demands my loyalty and once your    
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=315) loyalty is demanded well i said this for a muslim 
too of course you stay true to what has revealed    
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=322) god to you so i say all right the end why i'm a 
christian is because i have personally experienced    
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=329) i believe that i have personally experienced 
the presence of jesus christ actually um    
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=337) affecting what i feel and think. And 
so i have no alternative you know this is    
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=345) this is the this is the person who has revealed 
god to me personally but i so i'm not denying    
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=350) that muslims can have god revealed to them 
in a different way and i honor that way    
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=356) but it's not my way that's not i would like 
to try to understand it more that's true    
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=361) and be much in affinity with the Muslim 
world of thought but it's just not the way    
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=371) that it's happened for me it's not my it's not 
my not part of my autobiography. A    
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=379) supplementary question to that it just occurred 
to me you acknowledged that Muhammad is    
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=384) a prophet, in your in your knowledge of your 
colleagues in in Christian theology globally    
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=389) how widespread is that view do you think 
that Mohammed was a prophet of God amongst your    
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=397) academic colleagues who are christian theologians? 
I think it's almost universally accepted, I mean as    
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=403) you know even I suppose Roman Catholics are 
on the whole more conservative than i would be    
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=409) as an episcopalian but they now officially 
believe that uh islam is a revelation of god and    
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=417) that that's Vatican II, official electoration so 
i think it was my colleagues would undoubtedly    
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=426) say that. I mean I know lots of 
Christians wouldn't. But no well that's    
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=431) why i meant theologians, particularly those 
who know theologians would all accept  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=442) but you know the truth yeah well if you're 
asking the question how influential are    
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=448) theologians on most christians 
the answer is not in this matter  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=454) yeah, no I there's some of you input 
yeah anyway but that's interesting that    
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=459) that will come as quite a a revelation 
and a quite a shocking thing to say that    
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=464) uh in your experience most of your academic 
christian theological colleagues who are    
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=469) not catholics would actually see muhammad as a 
Prophet of God. Yes, yes, I think that's true. That's    
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=476) remarkable! That I didn't know actually it was 
a genuine question of mine um that's interesting    
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=481) so that that suggests a certain openness to other 
faiths and and overcoming these cultural barriers    
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=486) and looking beyond our own comfort zones and and 
recognizing patterns of commonality and similar    
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=492) spiritual dynamics and spiritual realities across 
the boundaries between religions and theologians    
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=498) today are well equipped to do that in 
our world in our global village perhaps.  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=507) I know you will know the work of Wilfred Cantwell Smith 
who was the founder of Harvard University's Center for the Study of World Religions,    
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=513) and he was an expert on islam that was his scholarly    
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=519) field uh and he he actually recommended 
that we should stop using the word religion    
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=525) as though there were different blocks of huge 
beliefs which everybody who's a christian has this    
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=532) block and everybody who's a muslim has that block 
and we just should talk about ways of faith and    
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=538) ways of approaching god and um i mean sympathy 
with that i think talking about a religion    
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=546) you know some of my some of the christians 
i know don't believe anything that i believe    
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=552) except they use the word jesus but 
they're talking about somebody else.    
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=557) I think that this speaks of a yawning chasm shall 
we say between your world in that sense uh of the    
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=564) academic theologians and certainly many in the 
pew say in the united states and and um africa    
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=569) and other parts of the world where that they 
are exclusivists to the absolute you know only    
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=575) i hear this all the time, only jesus will lead 
you to god and i say well okay so moses didn't    
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=581) know jesus is he damned because you've got to 
believe in jesus to be saved well what about all    
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=584) the prophets they didn't know and i'm not quite 
sure what the answer they give to that but it's    
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=588) a very uh binary absolutist exclusive world view 
which is a million miles from your own of course    
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=596) and it's a million miles away from uh saying that 
jesus is the savior of the world not of one little    
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=606) group within the world and of course people like 
ME and again most most of my academic colleagues    
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=614) would in general agree with this we would say 
that the savior of the world is of course god    
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=621) and it's only insofar as jesus mediates god that 
jesus is the savior of the world and we believe    
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=626) he does mediate god so we can say that but we're 
not excluding everybody else because god wants to    
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=632) save the whole world and i'm very clear about that 
and i think some of my muslim friends and i have    
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=642) been have a close association with 
the Oxford Islamic Centre and i think  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=651) most of them i think believe that too.    
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=655) I just want to say thank you 
very much indeed for your time and um  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=663) it was really really fascinating and i know 
uh many muslims um will be very interested    
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=669) in what you've said but in clarifying because 
we're often used to uh fundamentalist christians    
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=674) having a go and to hear an alternative 
voice of which your voice is certainly    
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=681) more more representative of 
christianity i think than the harsh extremism    
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=688) that we hear of it's good that muslims 
hear this and you're more openness to    
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=695) islam as well to be frank so um yeah thank you 
so much. I actually think Paul that until    
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=703) all the the major developed spiritual faiths 
of the world i include india and buddhism    
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=711) and forms of hinduism in this too until they come 
to a greater understanding of their own historical    
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=719) perspective and development and and shared 
goals and their differences as well and but    
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=726) have a sympathetic appreciation of that until that 
happens uh we're not going to adequately perceive    
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=734) the truth of our own tradition that we belong 
to. Yes, excellent. Well thank you very much and    
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=741) i'm going to end the discussion now and 
and thank you everyone for listening in and    
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=747) please leave your comments and your thoughts as well. Until next time. Thank you. I do think    
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/FkeoGRT_ATE?t=754) that Muhammad was a genuine Prophet of God. I do 
think that Muhammad was a genuine Prophet of God.
