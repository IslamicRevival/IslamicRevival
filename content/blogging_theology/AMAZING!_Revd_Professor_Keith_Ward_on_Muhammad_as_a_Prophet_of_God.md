<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">0:00:00</a> What do you as a Christian theologian 
make of the prophethood of Muhammad?    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5')">0:00:05</a> Do you have any thoughts about that?  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10')">0:00:10</a> I do think Muhammad was a genuine 
Prophet of God and that he was raised up by God    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('18')">0:00:18</a> and that the Quran is in some way an expression 
of God's Revelation. So I do think that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('33')">0:00:33</a> I am a Christian, I'm a follower of Jesus, 
so clearly I'm not a Muslim but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('39')">0:00:39</a> I would I think I'm totally opposed to people who 
misunderstand Islam as a rejection of Christianity.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('49')">0:00:49</a> I think that is not true. I think Islam would as 
I see it and Muhammad I don't think he knew much    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('56')">0:00:56</a> about Christianity. I would have thought he was 
opposed to some of the views of Christians that he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('62')">0:01:02</a> knew about and I think that's true, but I don't 
hold any of those views. In fact and none of my    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('68')">0:01:08</a> colleagues do. So there are differences, 
I mean there are clear differences but I   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('76')">0:01:16</a> think he was a genuine, Muhammed was a genuine Prophet 
of one God who stand against a sort of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('87')">0:01:27</a> popularized Christian version of there being three    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('91')">0:01:31</a> gods or let's see three different things in god, 
was correct he was justified in this so I    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('99')">0:01:39</a> see the difference between 
a school of Islam and a school of Christianity has    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('107')">0:01:47</a> about the same sort of difference as a difference 
between me and conservative Evangelical Christians.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('117')">0:01:57</a> That there are differences I can live with those 
I can respect those who differ from me and I    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('124')">0:02:04</a> think we have so I am not infallible so I'm 
not saying that I know that I'm right, to use    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('131')">0:02:11</a> an expression from the Quran 'God will decide 
who is right' but you have to go along with your    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> own feelings so I follow Jesus because I 
think he was a human expression of the wisdom    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('146')">0:02:26</a> and love of God and the main message of that 
is that God loves without exception everyone.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('154')">0:02:34</a> There are Christians who don't believe that, there 
are Muslims who do believe that, right but wouldn't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('161')">0:02:41</a> use words like Incarnation or the Trinity etc some 
certain forbidden terms but if you accept that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('170')">0:02:50</a> religious language is fluid and that all of us are 
unable to comprehend the nature of God precisely    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> I think islam and Christianity shouldn't 
really be regarded as two different religions. I    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> think they're two different ways of approaching 
God and I'm nearer to many Muslims than I am    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('193')">0:03:13</a> to many Christians. So that's a very interesting 
answer can I ask this question it's really    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('200')">0:03:20</a> really on behalf of i know some of the muslim 
viewers audience will want me to ask this.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> Muslims also have a very high regard for Jesus 
clearly yes and see him as a an incredibly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> wonderful human being who expressed the love of 
God to the outcasts and the sinners and so on and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('219')">0:03:39</a> and that's all wonderful, so your admiration for 
Jesus is shared by Muslims too, or they may be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('227')">0:03:47</a> expressed slightly differently of course. He's 
not seen as an Icon into God that we pray through    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> of course but they would wonder the question 
would be 'Why aren't you a Muslim?' If you accept it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('240')">0:04:00</a> in that mindset if you accept that Muhammad 
is a prophet of God and you believe in one god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('245')">0:04:05</a> god sent jesus that is virtually a definition of 
what a muslim believes anyway um so they would    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('252')">0:04:12</a> ask why aren't you a muslim and and saying 
you're a christian is not an answer because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('257')">0:04:17</a> for the reasons you mentioned muslims can already 
encompass that understanding as well that he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('261')">0:04:21</a> is someone who expresses the love of God to 
you and the wisdom of God in a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('265')">0:04:25</a> very special way, you know many sufi muslims could 
say yeah absolutely we agree with you but we're    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('270')">0:04:30</a> muslims so the question is 'Why are you not 
a Muslim?' That's the question. Well it's like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('276')">0:04:36</a> asking me why i'm an Anglican or an Episcopalian 
rather than a Methodist um because that's the way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> of thinking of God which has i feel demanded 
my loyalty. So it's a bit like saying why    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> do you uh prefer one view of philosophy to another 
view of philosophy and you say well because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('308')">0:05:08</a> that that's the way that seems right to me that 
attracts me to demands my loyalty and once your    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('315')">0:05:15</a> loyalty is demanded well i said this for a muslim 
too of course you stay true to what has revealed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> god to you so i say all right the end why i'm a 
christian is because i have personally experienced    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('329')">0:05:29</a> i believe that i have personally experienced 
the presence of jesus christ actually um    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('337')">0:05:37</a> affecting what i feel and think. And 
so i have no alternative you know this is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('345')">0:05:45</a> this is the this is the person who has revealed 
god to me personally but i so i'm not denying    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('350')">0:05:50</a> that muslims can have god revealed to them 
in a different way and i honor that way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('356')">0:05:56</a> but it's not my way that's not i would like 
to try to understand it more that's true    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('361')">0:06:01</a> and be much in affinity with the Muslim 
world of thought but it's just not the way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> that it's happened for me it's not my it's not 
my not part of my autobiography. A    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> supplementary question to that it just occurred 
to me you acknowledged that Muhammad is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('384')">0:06:24</a> a prophet, in your in your knowledge of your 
colleagues in in Christian theology globally    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('389')">0:06:29</a> how widespread is that view do you think 
that Mohammed was a prophet of God amongst your    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('397')">0:06:37</a> academic colleagues who are christian theologians? 
I think it's almost universally accepted, I mean as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> you know even I suppose Roman Catholics are 
on the whole more conservative than i would be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('409')">0:06:49</a> as an episcopalian but they now officially 
believe that uh islam is a revelation of god and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('417')">0:06:57</a> that that's Vatican II, official electoration so 
i think it was my colleagues would undoubtedly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> say that. I mean I know lots of 
Christians wouldn't. But no well that's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> why i meant theologians, particularly those 
who know theologians would all accept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('442')">0:07:22</a> but you know the truth yeah well if you're 
asking the question how influential are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('448')">0:07:28</a> theologians on most christians 
the answer is not in this matter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> yeah, no I there's some of you input 
yeah anyway but that's interesting that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> that will come as quite a a revelation 
and a quite a shocking thing to say that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('464')">0:07:44</a> uh in your experience most of your academic 
christian theological colleagues who are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> not catholics would actually see muhammad as a 
Prophet of God. Yes, yes, I think that's true. That's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('476')">0:07:56</a> remarkable! That I didn't know actually it was 
a genuine question of mine um that's interesting    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> so that that suggests a certain openness to other 
faiths and and overcoming these cultural barriers    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> and looking beyond our own comfort zones and and 
recognizing patterns of commonality and similar    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('492')">0:08:12</a> spiritual dynamics and spiritual realities across 
the boundaries between religions and theologians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('498')">0:08:18</a> today are well equipped to do that in 
our world in our global village perhaps.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('507')">0:08:27</a> I know you will know the work of Wilfred Cantwell Smith 
who was the founder of Harvard University's Center for the Study of World Religions,    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('513')">0:08:33</a> and he was an expert on islam that was his scholarly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('519')">0:08:39</a> field uh and he he actually recommended 
that we should stop using the word religion    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('525')">0:08:45</a> as though there were different blocks of huge 
beliefs which everybody who's a christian has this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532')">0:08:52</a> block and everybody who's a muslim has that block 
and we just should talk about ways of faith and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('538')">0:08:58</a> ways of approaching god and um i mean sympathy 
with that i think talking about a religion    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> you know some of my some of the christians 
i know don't believe anything that i believe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('552')">0:09:12</a> except they use the word jesus but 
they're talking about somebody else.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('557')">0:09:17</a> I think that this speaks of a yawning chasm shall 
we say between your world in that sense uh of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('564')">0:09:24</a> academic theologians and certainly many in the 
pew say in the united states and and um africa    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('569')">0:09:29</a> and other parts of the world where that they 
are exclusivists to the absolute you know only    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('575')">0:09:35</a> i hear this all the time, only jesus will lead 
you to god and i say well okay so moses didn't    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('581')">0:09:41</a> know jesus is he damned because you've got to 
believe in jesus to be saved well what about all    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('584')">0:09:44</a> the prophets they didn't know and i'm not quite 
sure what the answer they give to that but it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('588')">0:09:48</a> a very uh binary absolutist exclusive world view 
which is a million miles from your own of course    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('596')">0:09:56</a> and it's a million miles away from uh saying that 
jesus is the savior of the world not of one little    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> group within the world and of course people like 
ME and again most most of my academic colleagues    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('614')">0:10:14</a> would in general agree with this we would say 
that the savior of the world is of course god    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('621')">0:10:21</a> and it's only insofar as jesus mediates god that 
jesus is the savior of the world and we believe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('626')">0:10:26</a> he does mediate god so we can say that but we're 
not excluding everybody else because god wants to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('632')">0:10:32</a> save the whole world and i'm very clear about that 
and i think some of my muslim friends and i have    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('642')">0:10:42</a> been have a close association with 
the Oxford Islamic Centre and i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('651')">0:10:51</a> most of them i think believe that too.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> I just want to say thank you 
very much indeed for your time and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('663')">0:11:03</a> it was really really fascinating and i know 
uh many muslims um will be very interested    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('669')">0:11:09</a> in what you've said but in clarifying because 
we're often used to uh fundamentalist christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674')">0:11:14</a> having a go and to hear an alternative 
voice of which your voice is certainly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('681')">0:11:21</a> more more representative of 
christianity i think than the harsh extremism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('688')">0:11:28</a> that we hear of it's good that muslims 
hear this and you're more openness to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> islam as well to be frank so um yeah thank you 
so much. I actually think Paul that until    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('703')">0:11:43</a> all the the major developed spiritual faiths 
of the world i include india and buddhism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('711')">0:11:51</a> and forms of hinduism in this too until they come 
to a greater understanding of their own historical    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('719')">0:11:59</a> perspective and development and and shared 
goals and their differences as well and but    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('726')">0:12:06</a> have a sympathetic appreciation of that until that 
happens uh we're not going to adequately perceive    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('734')">0:12:14</a> the truth of our own tradition that we belong 
to. Yes, excellent. Well thank you very much and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('741')">0:12:21</a> i'm going to end the discussion now and 
and thank you everyone for listening in and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('747')">0:12:27</a> please leave your comments and your thoughts as well. Until next time. Thank you. I do think    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('754')">0:12:34</a> that Muhammad was a genuine Prophet of God. I do 
think that Muhammad was a genuine Prophet of God.
