## Description

Regular content featuring book reviews, comment on religious news, and interviews with distinguished scholars and experts. 

Welcome to the Blogging Theology YouTube channel! Blogging Theology is my small attempt to introduce some academic and scholarly content to the subject matter of comparative religion, especially concerning the Abrahamic faiths Judaism, Christianity and Islam. I review books, talk about current affairs, and interview leading figures from the world of theology and faith.

You can follow Blogging Theology on Instagram under the name bloggingtheology1; also on Facebook - just search for Blogging Theology; and you can follow me on Twitter on my twitter handle @freemonotheist.

Please consider supporting my work on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Bloggingtheology?fan_landing=true

As this channel has grown larger I am now realising how important it is to control the content I produce. So going forward I would ask that folks ask my permission before copying videos, and translating them into other languages.

Thank you all for your wonderful support and encouragement. I really do appreciate it.

Till next time!
