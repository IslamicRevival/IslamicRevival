[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=5) One of the most common criticisms of the 
Qur'an by polemicists particularly christians    
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=13) is that the name of God 'Yahweh' found in the Torah 
is simply not there in the Qur'an, so Allah is the    
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=21) name of God in the Qur'an not Yahweh. And this of 
course for them is a a big problem. I'm happy to    
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=28) say that Dr Ali Atai who had the immense privilege 
of talking with on Friday, he can read    
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=36) and write biblical hebrew, biblical greek, arabic 
obviously English, persian and he's an expert on    
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=45) the Bible and the Qur'an and here's a short 
extract from the video you can see on youtube    
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=52) i'll link it in the description below where 
he responds to this this criticism that    
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=58) the name of God in the Qur'an is Allah not Yahweh 
and having listened to this carefully i personally    
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=65) find Dr Ali Atai's comments and analysis to be 
completely convincing and if i didn't think    
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=73) they were convincing i would say so but i happen 
to think they are and they effectively deal with    
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=77) this issue once and for all so i hope people 
will pay attention to what he says and take it on    
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=83) board and perhaps we can move on from this issue 
which is basically a red herring. OK enjoy! Verse    
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=90) eight he says i am the lord ani adonai i am yod 
hey the tetragrammaton that is my name i will    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=99) not give my glory to another nor share my praise 
with carved idols now where critic will say here    
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=108) but the name of God in the Quran is Allah it's 
not Yahweh so here's my response to this the the    
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=114) word 'Yahweh' is a human invention in the Tanakh 
the name of God is represented by four letters  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=125) it's called the tetragrammaton the shema forage 
nobody knows how to pronounce these letters    
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=133) or what they really mean the the words yahweh or 
jehovah are fabrications of the tetragrammaton    
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=140) that are not scriptural however sometimes in 
the tanakh the tetragrammaton is abbreviated    
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=148) as who or ho in hebrew with the two middle 
letters the hey and the wow the hay and the valve    
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=156) these are the the prominent letters 
of the tetragrammaton for example    
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=159) and i mentioned this last time as well the 
name joshua yehoshua the lord is salvation    
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=165) hey and yo hoshua the name elijah eli who my god 
is the lord who hey and the quran says allah allah    
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=179) illahu allah allah illah illah who god there is 
no god but who the ha and the wow same letters  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=192) right say whoa is god the one and only so this is 
confirmed in the quran you know it's it's a bit    
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=199) strange to me that christians claim that emmanuel 
mentioned in in isaiah 7 14 is a prophecy jesus    
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=209) this is what matthew says but jesus's name 
was not immanuel it was jesus the name's    
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=216) emmanuel and jesus have nothing in common the 
response would be well the meaning of emmanuel    
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=224) applies to jesus okay so what is 
the meaning of the tetragrammaton    
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=229) nobody knows definitively but the dominant 
opinion is that it probably has something    
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=234) something to do with eternality that god is 
okay fine that meaning is also in the quran okay  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=248) that's the first sentence of ayatul kurusi 
the verse of the throne chapter 2 verse 255    
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=255) god there is no god but who he the living the 
living meaning the eternal the self-subsisting    
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=263) so in that first line you have 
the meaning of an ismul adam  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=270) so the tetragrammaton is confirmed in the quran 
both in its articulation as well as in its meaning  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=280) okay and obviously that's that we can talk 
about that that's a different topic but this    
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=285) is a very common trope right allah is not the 
tetragrammaton uh the name of god is yahweh    
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=293) the word yahweh does not appear anywhere in the 
bible you've added these vowels is it interesting    
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=300) they're christians i i i agree i hear this 
all the time but of course the word yahweh    
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=303) is never mentioned in the new testament either 
it's not as if the gospels have this word    
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=307) around paul never mentions the word he has 
anyone else said it's pretty absent from the    
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=312) new testament yeah so we'll use the same you 
know christian again the christians will say    
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=316) emmanuel is not the name of jesus oh that's what 
his name means okay then fine what does yahweh    
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=320) mean it probably means which means to be it's 
the present tense verb of of of the of the verb    
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/6yfMHGC1um4?t=329) which means to be meaning god is uh eternal 
and that meaning is also found uh in the quran
