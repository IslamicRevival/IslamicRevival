The events that took place after Muhammad's revelation are covered in this video. After his initial discovery of the idols, abd al-muttalib was forced to continue digging by his disbelieving community. When he hit a well cover, he exclaimed thankfulness to god and the crowd gathered. They then decided to divide the treasure evenly between the tribe and the mosque.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfaguOrr-Hs&t=0)** Abd al-Muttalib visited the Kaaba regularly and would pray at the black stone. One night, a shadowy figure came to him in a vision and said to dig sweet clarity - which he did. The figure then vanished. The next night, he was told to dig the treasured horde and he was told to find a place where there was blood and dung. He found the ants' nest and the pecking ravens, and was also told to pray for clear full flowing water. After fulfilling all these commands, Abd al-Muttalib went to the door of the Kaaba and took hold of the metal ring which hung from the lock, praying the prayer which he had been told to pray. A bird landed behind him and another landed, and they strutted off with their ravens. Abdal-Muttalib knew these birds well, as they had been adopted as idols by the Quraish. Abdal-Muttalib then walked back past the door to the Iraqi corner and the Syrian corner and then to the Yemenite corner. Finally, he reached the two statuesque rocks which were opposite the door and which were where the Quraish sacrificed their victims. Abdal-Muttalib

[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=20) adjoining the north west side of the  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=23) kaaba there is a small precinct  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=25) surrounded by a low semicircular wall  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=30) the two ends of the wall stop short of  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=32) the north and west corners of the house  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=35) leaving a passage for pilgrims  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=39) but many pilgrims make wide their circle  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=41) at this point and include the precinct  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=44) within their orbit  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=46) passing round the outside of the low  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=49) wall  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=51) the space within it is named hija  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=54) ishmael because the tombs of ishmael and  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=57) hagar lie beneath the stones which pave  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=60) it  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=63) so loved to be near the kaaba that he  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=66) would sometimes order a couch to be  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=68) spread for him in the hijra  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=71) and one night when he was sleeping there  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=74) a shadowy figure came to him in a vision  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=77) and said  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=79) dig sweet clarity  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=82) what is sweet clarity he asked but the  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=84) speaker vanished  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=87) he nonetheless felt such happiness and  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=90) peace of soul when he woke that he  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=93) determined to spend the next night in  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=95) the same place  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=98) the visitant returned and said  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=100) dig beneficence  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=103) but again his question received no  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=105) answer  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=107) the third night he used he was told  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=110) dig the treasured horde  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=112) and yet again the speaker vanished at  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=114) his questioning  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=117) but the fourth night the command was  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=120) dig zamzam  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=122) and this time when he said what is  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=124) zamzam the speaker said  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=128) dig her thou shalt not regret  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=132) for she is thine inheritance from my  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=135) greatest ancestor  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=138) dry she never will  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=140) nor fail to water all the pilgrim throng  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=146) then the speaker told him to look for a  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=148) place where there was blood and dung an  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=152) ants nest and pecking  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=154) ravens finally he was told to pray for  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=158) clear full flowing water that will water  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=161) god's pilgrims throughout their  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=164) pilgrimage  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=166) when dawn was breaking abd al-muttalib  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=170) left rose and left the hija at the north  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=173) corner of the holy house which is called  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=175) the iraqi corner  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=177) then he walked along the north east wall  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=180) at the other end of which is the door of  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=183) the kaaba  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=184) and passing this he stopped a few feet  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=188) beyond it at the east corner where he  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=191) reverently kissed the black stone  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=194) from there he began the right of the  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=197) rounds going back past the door to the  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=200) iraqi corner across the hija to the west  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=203) corner the syrian corner and thence to  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=206) the yemenite corner which is towards the  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=209) south  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=211) the children of abraham are like the  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=214) lines of ishmael and isaac  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=216) go round their sanctuaries with a  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=218) movement opposite to that of the sun  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=223) as he walked from the yemenite corner to  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=225) the black stone he could see the dark  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=228) slope of abu kubais  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=231) and beyond it the further eastern hills  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=234) sharply outlined against the yellow  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=237) light  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=238) seven times he went the round and each  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=241) time the light appreciably brighter  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=245) for in arabia the dawns and the dusks  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=248) are brief  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=250) having fulfilled the right he went from  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=252) the black stone to the door and  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=255) taking hold of the metal ring which hung  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=258) from the lock  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=259) he prayed the prayer which he had been  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=261) told to pray  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=265) there was a sound of wings and a bird  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=268) alighted in the sand behind him  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=271) then another bird alighted and having  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=273) finished his supplication he turned and  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=276) watched them strut with their raven's  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=279) gate towards the two statuesque rocks  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=283) which had which were about a hundred  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=286) yards away almost opposite the door  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=290) these had been adopted as idols  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=294) and it was between them that the quraish  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=296) sacrificed their victims  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=299) abdal muttalib knew well as did the  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=302) ravens that there was always blood in  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=305) the sand at that place  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=308) there was also dung  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=310) and going up to it he now saw that there  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=313) was an ants nest  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=316) he went to his house and took two  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=318) pickaxes one of which were his was for  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=322) his son harith whom he brought with him  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=324) to the place where he knew that he must  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=328) dig  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=329) the thud of the talls in the sand and  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=332) the unusual sight for the courtyard  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=335) could be seen from all sides  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=337) soon attracted a crowd  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=340) and despite the respect generally felt  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=343) for abd al mutalib it was not long  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=346) before some of them protested that it  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=349) was sacrilege to dig at the place of  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=352) sacrifice between the idols and that he  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=355) must stop  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=358) he said he would not  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=361) and told harith to stand by him and see  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=364) that no one interfered with his digging  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=368) it was a tense moment and the outcome  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=372) could have been unpleasant  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=375) but the two hashemites were determined  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=377) and united whereas the onlookers have  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=381) been taken by surprise  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=384) nor did these idols issaf and na ila  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=388) hold a high rank among the idols of  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=391) mecca  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=392) and some even said that they were a  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=395) jerunite man and woman who had been  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=397) turned to stone for profaning the kaaba  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=402) so abd al-muttalib continued to dig  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=405) without any actual move been made to  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=408) stop him  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=409) and some of the people were already  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=412) leaving the sanctuary  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=413) when  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=414) suddenly he struck the wells stone  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=418) covering and uttered a cry of  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=421) thanksgiving to god  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=424) the crowd reassembled and increased and  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=427) when he began to dig out the treasure  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=430) which jerhum had buried there  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=432) everyone claimed the right to a share of  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=435) it  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=436) abd al-mutaleb agreed that lots should  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=439) be cast for each object  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=442) as to whether it should be kept in the  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=444) sanctuary  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=445) or go with him personally or be divided  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=448) amongst the tribe  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=451) this had become the recognized way of  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=454) deciding an issue of doubt  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=457) and it was done by means of divining  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=459) arrows inside the kaaba  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=462) in front of the moabite idol hubal  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=466) in this instance some of the treasure  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=469) went to the kaaba and some to abd  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=472) al-muttalib  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=473) but none of it to the croatia in general  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=478) it was also agreed that the clan of  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=480) hashim should have charge of zamzam  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=484) itself  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=485) since in any case it was their function  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=488) to water the pilgrims  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=492) that was chapter four the recovery of a  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=495) loss  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/OfaguOrr-Hs?t=496) till next time
