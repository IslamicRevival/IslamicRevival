<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3')">0:00:03</a> Some rather astonishing religious news hit the 
headlines yesterday here in the UK and I want to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10')">0:00:10</a> focus on how it affects Christians and Muslims 
here the BBC reported quote for the first time    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('17')">0:00:17</a> fewer than half of people in England and Wales 
describe themselves as Christian the census    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('24')">0:00:24</a> 2021 has revealed the proportion of people who 
said they were Christian was 46.2 percent down    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('34')">0:00:34</a> from 59.3 percent in the last census in 2011 
that's 10 years ago in contrast the number    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('43')">0:00:43</a> who said they had no religion increased to 
37.2 percent of the population up from a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('51')">0:00:51</a> quarter and interestingly those identifying as 
Muslim Rose from 4.9 in 2011 to 6.5 last year    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('63')">0:01:03</a> now the census is carried out every 10 
years by the office for National statistics    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('70')">0:01:10</a> Professor Linda Woodhead commented ticking no 
religion does not mean having no beliefs she    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('77')">0:01:17</a> said and Linda is Professor of religious 
studies at King's College here in London    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('83')">0:01:23</a> she said some will be atheists a lot would 
be agnostic they just say I don't really    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('89')">0:01:29</a> know and some will be spiritual and be doing 
spiritual Things She Said Scotland's census    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('96')">0:01:36</a> by the way was due to take place last year but 
was delayed by a year due to the covid pandemic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('104')">0:01:44</a> now in another report in the guardian we 
read the census revealed a 5.5 million    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('112')">0:01:52</a> four in the number of people who describe 
themselves as Christian now that's a 17 full    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('120')">0:02:00</a> and a 1.2 million rise in the number of people 
who say they follow Islam bringing the Muslim    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> population to 3.9 million now that's a 43 increase 
in the number of people who identify as Muslim    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> uh the guardian says it's the first time in 
a census of England and Wales that fewer than    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> half the population have described themselves as 
Christian so it's the first time in history that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('151')">0:02:31</a> uh less than half the population call themselves 
Christians it's a very significant watershed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> moment so according to the new census to summarize 
there are nearly four million Muslims in England    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('166')">0:02:46</a> and Wales and all this despite the negative 
media coverage of Islam in the popular press    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('174')">0:02:54</a> Five Pillars the Muslim news site in 
the UK says and I quote that London    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('180')">0:03:00</a> is the place London is the place with 
the highest concentration of Muslims    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('186')">0:03:06</a> 15 percent of malandanas describe themselves 
as Muslim up from 12.6 in 2021 that's just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('195')">0:03:15</a> last year from 12 to 15 this means that over 
1.3 million Muslims are living in London alone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('207')">0:03:27</a> commenting on this uh latest Census Data the 
Muslim Council of Britain Secretary General Zara    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> Muhammad said and I quote while our nation has an 
increasingly aging population the contribution to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('222')">0:03:42</a> the workforce of a youthful Muslim population 
remains a strategic National Asset the last    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('230')">0:03:50</a> decade has seen more second and third generation 
Muslims confident of our faith and place in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('237')">0:03:57</a> society contributing immensely to the economic 
recovery and vitality of our nation and quote    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('247')">0:04:07</a> now why should this matter to The Wider Muslim 
population what relevance does Islam have well    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('255')">0:04:15</a> I'd like to introduce you to a man called Henry 
stubb and I'm going to be reading uh from this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('262')">0:04:22</a> marvelous book called uh traveling home essays 
on Islam and Europe by Abdul Hakeem who teaches    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('269')">0:04:29</a> uh Islam at the University of Cambridge and 
um in his book on page 85 he introduces us    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('277')">0:04:37</a> to Henry's stub he was a physician a doctor to 
James the first James the first who died in 1625    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('286')">0:04:46</a> was King of England and he famously of course 
produced the King James version of the Bible    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('293')">0:04:53</a> that's why it's called the King James version of 
the Bible so Henry stubb was his uh his physician    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> and he wrote uh Stubbs wrote the first 
according to Tim winter here Abdul Hakim    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('305')">0:05:05</a> Murad the first appreciative biography of 
the Prophet ever written by a Christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312')">0:05:12</a> and this indicates he writes the real 
convergence of which the real conversions which    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('319')">0:05:19</a> his contemporaries noticed between Islam and a 
certain kind of puritanism puritanism was the the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('327')">0:05:27</a> kind of movement of the day of kind of Evangelical 
renewal in the church and um Henry Stubbs writes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('335')">0:05:35</a> the following and it's kind of the Old English 
but I'd like to share it with you he writes this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('340')">0:05:40</a> is the sum of muhammadan religion that's what 
he means by Islam on the one hand not clogging    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('348')">0:05:48</a> men's Faith with the necessity of believing a 
number of obtrusive Notions which they cannot    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('355')">0:05:55</a> comprehend and which are often contradictory to 
the dictates of reason and Common Sense nor on    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('364')">0:06:04</a> the other hand loading them with the performance 
of many Troublesome expensive and superstitious    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> ceremonies yet in joining a Jew observance of 
religious worship as the surest method to keep    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('381')">0:06:21</a> men in the bounds of their Duty both to God and 
man end quote now the uh this is taken from his    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('390')">0:06:30</a> book Stubbs book which is amazingly entitled an 
account of the rise and progress of muhammadanism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('397')">0:06:37</a> and a Vindication of him and his religion from 
the culminaries of the Christians now comrie is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('406')">0:06:46</a> as a way of saying the malicious misrepresentation 
the lies of the Christians now he is a Christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('412')">0:06:52</a> of course himself it's interesting the this idea 
of Christian lies what one perhaps can still find    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418')">0:06:58</a> this at Speaker's Corner where Islam is routinely 
misrepresented uh quite often maliciously by uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> the Christian missionaries there I don't mean to 
say that all missionaries are like that of course    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('430')">0:07:10</a> so this is a fascinating uh insight into the 
earliest appreciation in England we have of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('437')">0:07:17</a> Islam from a very senior and distinguished 
scholar physician to the king himself I    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> wonder if he had conversations with King James 
about uh Islam who knows so this tells us that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('453')">0:07:33</a> he was aware stops US aware of the similarity 
between the beliefs of Islam and his own    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> Unitarian Christianity and he can be seen 
as part of a growing Tradition at this time    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> expressing a dissatisfaction with the intellectual 
inconsistencies of trinitarianism as he saw it and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> he's seeking to discover the original Unitarian 
roots of the Christian tradition in the Middle    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('482')">0:08:02</a> East and this is very interesting because 
he identifies Islam with this and of course    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('487')">0:08:07</a> we can go back to Moses and then to Jesus and to 
Muhammad peace be upon them all all of them from    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('493')">0:08:13</a> the Middle East from the same part of the world 
and so even this early on there was a awareness    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('499')">0:08:19</a> in some courses in England or the authenticity 
and the truth of Islam so this is the relevance    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> really of Islam it's a calling back uh to the ab 
the faith of Moses Abraham Jesus and Muhammad of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('514')">0:08:34</a> course peace be upon them all I believe in 
one God a Unitarian Faith a god of Mercy a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('520')">0:08:40</a> God of Justice a god of love and so on and this 
is part of English History it's not alien to it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('527')">0:08:47</a> um and all of these religions as I say find their 
Roots the historical roots in the Middle East    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532')">0:08:52</a> so if we have accepted Christianity as part of 
our history in England then Islam is no less a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('539')">0:08:59</a> part of the historical uh Heritage as well so um 
there we are I just wanted to share with amazing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> news Islam is the one religion uh major world 
religion in Britain that is Bucking the trend    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('551')">0:09:11</a> and is increasing its adherence quite dramatically 
mainly of course through immigration but not just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('558')">0:09:18</a> through immigration also through uh conversion 
there are hundreds of thousands at least of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('564')">0:09:24</a> English people who have converted to Islam 
and there's a steady stream of people who    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('570')">0:09:30</a> are converting to the faith particularly and 
interestingly amongst women who are attracted    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('576')">0:09:36</a> to the values of the faith the Dignity of women 
of course is a key theme in Islam spoken of in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('581')">0:09:41</a> the Quran and in the death of the Prophet himself 
upon whom be peace and this attracts many women    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('588')">0:09:48</a> um over against the materialism and the 
sexualization of gender and and their own    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('593')">0:09:53</a> sex of course that they see in wider Society so um 
this census result is a very interesting news um    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('601')">0:10:01</a> the the inexorable I think the inexual decline of 
Christianity in Britain and the rise of Islam and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('608')">0:10:08</a> other um spiritualities as well not just Islam but 
Islam is by far the most significant um increase    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('615')">0:10:15</a> I think of all and uh and it remains it will 
in the future I think become the main um focus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('624')">0:10:24</a> of monotheistic energy in Britain as the other 
abrahamic faiths uh decline anyway till next time
