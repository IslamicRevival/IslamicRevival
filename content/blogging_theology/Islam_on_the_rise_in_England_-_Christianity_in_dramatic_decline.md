[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=3) Some rather astonishing religious news hit the 
headlines yesterday here in the UK and I want to    
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=10) focus on how it affects Christians and Muslims 
here the BBC reported quote for the first time    
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=17) fewer than half of people in England and Wales 
describe themselves as Christian the census    
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=24) 2021 has revealed the proportion of people who 
said they were Christian was 46.2 percent down    
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=34) from 59.3 percent in the last census in 2011 
that's 10 years ago in contrast the number    
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=43) who said they had no religion increased to 
37.2 percent of the population up from a    
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=51) quarter and interestingly those identifying as 
Muslim Rose from 4.9 in 2011 to 6.5 last year    
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=63) now the census is carried out every 10 
years by the office for National statistics    
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=70) Professor Linda Woodhead commented ticking no 
religion does not mean having no beliefs she    
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=77) said and Linda is Professor of religious 
studies at King's College here in London    
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=83) she said some will be atheists a lot would 
be agnostic they just say I don't really    
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=89) know and some will be spiritual and be doing 
spiritual Things She Said Scotland's census    
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=96) by the way was due to take place last year but 
was delayed by a year due to the covid pandemic    
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=104) now in another report in the guardian we 
read the census revealed a 5.5 million    
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=112) four in the number of people who describe 
themselves as Christian now that's a 17 full    
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=120) and a 1.2 million rise in the number of people 
who say they follow Islam bringing the Muslim    
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=128) population to 3.9 million now that's a 43 increase 
in the number of people who identify as Muslim    
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=137) uh the guardian says it's the first time in 
a census of England and Wales that fewer than    
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=144) half the population have described themselves as 
Christian so it's the first time in history that    
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=151) uh less than half the population call themselves 
Christians it's a very significant watershed    
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=157) moment so according to the new census to summarize 
there are nearly four million Muslims in England    
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=166) and Wales and all this despite the negative 
media coverage of Islam in the popular press    
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=174) Five Pillars the Muslim news site in 
the UK says and I quote that London    
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=180) is the place London is the place with 
the highest concentration of Muslims    
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=186) 15 percent of malandanas describe themselves 
as Muslim up from 12.6 in 2021 that's just    
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=195) last year from 12 to 15 this means that over 
1.3 million Muslims are living in London alone  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=207) commenting on this uh latest Census Data the 
Muslim Council of Britain Secretary General Zara    
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=214) Muhammad said and I quote while our nation has an 
increasingly aging population the contribution to    
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=222) the workforce of a youthful Muslim population 
remains a strategic National Asset the last    
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=230) decade has seen more second and third generation 
Muslims confident of our faith and place in    
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=237) society contributing immensely to the economic 
recovery and vitality of our nation and quote    
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=247) now why should this matter to The Wider Muslim 
population what relevance does Islam have well    
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=255) I'd like to introduce you to a man called Henry 
stubb and I'm going to be reading uh from this    
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=262) marvelous book called uh traveling home essays 
on Islam and Europe by Abdul Hakeem who teaches    
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=269) uh Islam at the University of Cambridge and 
um in his book on page 85 he introduces us    
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=277) to Henry's stub he was a physician a doctor to 
James the first James the first who died in 1625    
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=286) was King of England and he famously of course 
produced the King James version of the Bible    
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=293) that's why it's called the King James version of 
the Bible so Henry stubb was his uh his physician    
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=299) and he wrote uh Stubbs wrote the first 
according to Tim winter here Abdul Hakim    
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=305) Murad the first appreciative biography of 
the Prophet ever written by a Christian    
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=312) and this indicates he writes the real 
convergence of which the real conversions which    
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=319) his contemporaries noticed between Islam and a 
certain kind of puritanism puritanism was the the    
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=327) kind of movement of the day of kind of Evangelical 
renewal in the church and um Henry Stubbs writes    
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=335) the following and it's kind of the Old English 
but I'd like to share it with you he writes this    
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=340) is the sum of muhammadan religion that's what 
he means by Islam on the one hand not clogging    
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=348) men's Faith with the necessity of believing a 
number of obtrusive Notions which they cannot    
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=355) comprehend and which are often contradictory to 
the dictates of reason and Common Sense nor on    
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=364) the other hand loading them with the performance 
of many Troublesome expensive and superstitious    
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=371) ceremonies yet in joining a Jew observance of 
religious worship as the surest method to keep    
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=381) men in the bounds of their Duty both to God and 
man end quote now the uh this is taken from his    
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=390) book Stubbs book which is amazingly entitled an 
account of the rise and progress of muhammadanism    
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=397) and a Vindication of him and his religion from 
the culminaries of the Christians now comrie is    
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=406) as a way of saying the malicious misrepresentation 
the lies of the Christians now he is a Christian    
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=412) of course himself it's interesting the this idea 
of Christian lies what one perhaps can still find    
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=418) this at Speaker's Corner where Islam is routinely 
misrepresented uh quite often maliciously by uh    
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=426) the Christian missionaries there I don't mean to 
say that all missionaries are like that of course    
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=430) so this is a fascinating uh insight into the 
earliest appreciation in England we have of    
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=437) Islam from a very senior and distinguished 
scholar physician to the king himself I    
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=443) wonder if he had conversations with King James 
about uh Islam who knows so this tells us that    
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=453) he was aware stops US aware of the similarity 
between the beliefs of Islam and his own    
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=459) Unitarian Christianity and he can be seen 
as part of a growing Tradition at this time    
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=465) expressing a dissatisfaction with the intellectual 
inconsistencies of trinitarianism as he saw it and    
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=474) he's seeking to discover the original Unitarian 
roots of the Christian tradition in the Middle    
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=482) East and this is very interesting because 
he identifies Islam with this and of course    
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=487) we can go back to Moses and then to Jesus and to 
Muhammad peace be upon them all all of them from    
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=493) the Middle East from the same part of the world 
and so even this early on there was a awareness    
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=499) in some courses in England or the authenticity 
and the truth of Islam so this is the relevance    
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=506) really of Islam it's a calling back uh to the ab 
the faith of Moses Abraham Jesus and Muhammad of    
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=514) course peace be upon them all I believe in 
one God a Unitarian Faith a god of Mercy a    
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=520) God of Justice a god of love and so on and this 
is part of English History it's not alien to it    
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=527) um and all of these religions as I say find their 
Roots the historical roots in the Middle East    
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=532) so if we have accepted Christianity as part of 
our history in England then Islam is no less a    
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=539) part of the historical uh Heritage as well so um 
there we are I just wanted to share with amazing    
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=546) news Islam is the one religion uh major world 
religion in Britain that is Bucking the trend    
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=551) and is increasing its adherence quite dramatically 
mainly of course through immigration but not just    
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=558) through immigration also through uh conversion 
there are hundreds of thousands at least of    
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=564) English people who have converted to Islam 
and there's a steady stream of people who    
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=570) are converting to the faith particularly and 
interestingly amongst women who are attracted    
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=576) to the values of the faith the Dignity of women 
of course is a key theme in Islam spoken of in    
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=581) the Quran and in the death of the Prophet himself 
upon whom be peace and this attracts many women    
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=588) um over against the materialism and the 
sexualization of gender and and their own    
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=593) sex of course that they see in wider Society so um 
this census result is a very interesting news um    
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=601) the the inexorable I think the inexual decline of 
Christianity in Britain and the rise of Islam and    
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=608) other um spiritualities as well not just Islam but 
Islam is by far the most significant um increase    
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=615) I think of all and uh and it remains it will 
in the future I think become the main um focus    
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/R1IF9maoMj8?t=624) of monotheistic energy in Britain as the other 
abrahamic faiths uh decline anyway till next time
