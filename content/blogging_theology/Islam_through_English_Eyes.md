[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=6) I just wanted to share with you some 
gems from a British writer Gai Eaton    
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=10) who died in 2010. He was a convert to islam and 
he had been a muslim for over 50 years when he    
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=18) sadly passed away he was also an historian wrote 
many books and a popular speaker and he worked    
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=25) also at regents park mosque in 
london for many years as well    
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=29) and i want to quote some of these absolute gems 
uh from some of his books uh one of my favorite    
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=36) books actually is a book he wrote called Islam 
and the Destiny of Man and in there he wrote    
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=42) the modern westerner persuaded that he has a 
right to think for himself and imagining that he    
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=49) exercises this right is unwilling to acknowledge 
that his every thought has been shaped by cultural    
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=56) and historical influences and that his opinions 
fit like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle into a pattern    
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=64) which has nothing random about it that's an 
amazing quote i mean he's saying that we all like    
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=70) in the west like to think uh for ourselves and 
uh and that we do that and we exercise this right    
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=75) and in fact but in fact we end up thinking 
pretty much the same on most issues i mean of    
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=81) the day whether it be politically correct issues 
or other issues so in fact it's a bit of a myth    
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=87) that we all do think for ourselves we all think 
within the box rather than outside of it usually    
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=92) in another quote from the same book he wrote about 
the agnostic very profound insight the agnostic    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=99) has a very curious notion of religion he is 
convinced that a man who says i believe in god    
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=106) should at once become perfect if this does not 
happen then the believer must be a fraud and a    
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=113) hypocrite he thinks that adherence to a religion 
is the end of the road whereas it is in fact only    
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=121) the beginning of a very long and sometimes very 
rough road he looks for consistency in religious    
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=129) people however aware he may be of inconsistencies 
in himself very true very true and this next quote    
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=138) from the same book is such a beautiful couple of 
sentences that really it's just stunning i want    
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=143) to share this with you people are not always what 
they say they are or even what they think they are    
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=153) but there is one who sees us objectively 
and have and we have reason to be thankful    
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=160) that he is called the merciful the compassionate 
the forgiving that's a beautiful quote    
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=168) and the next one i must say made me feel rather 
awkward and uneasy when i read it he wrote in    
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=175) the same book a man might spend a lifetime reading 
spiritual books and studying the writings of the    
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=182) great mystics he might feel that he has penetrated 
the secrets of the heavens and the earth    
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=188) but unless this knowledge was incorporated into 
his very nature and transformed him it was sterile    
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=198) i began to suspect that a simple man of faith 
praying to god with little understanding but    
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=205) with a full heart might be worth more than the 
most learned student of the spiritual sciences    
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=214) wow painful very true very true and here's a 
quote from another of his books king of the castle    
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=222) choice and responsibility in the modern 
world where he wrote men who scorn the idea    
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=230) of submission to the divine will are outraged 
by the notion of a god who requires submission    
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=238) are among the first to demand 
total submission to the process    
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=242) in which we are involved and seem to attach a kind 
of moral imperative to willing participation in it    
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=251) any other attitude so they say is reactionary or 
escapist or anti-social perhaps after all they    
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=259) have found a divinity to worship and if they have 
the only charitable comment must be god help them  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=271) and here's another quote from the same book 
which speaks of our human condition uh people who    
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=278) lose people we love of grief and so 
on and he writes in king of the castle    
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=285) we are all of us exposed to grief the 
people we love die as we shall ourselves    
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=292) in due course expectations are disappointed 
and ambitions are thwarted by circumstance    
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=302) finally there are some who insist upon 
feeling guilty over the ill they have done    
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=307) or simply on account of the ugliness which they 
perceive in their own souls a solution of a kind    
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=315) has been found to this problem in the 
form of sedatives and antidepressant drugs    
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=322) so that many human experiences which used to 
be accepted as an integral part of human life    
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=329) are now defined and dealt with as medical 
problems the widow who grieves for a beloved    
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=337) husband becomes a case as does the man sadden by 
the recollection of the napalm or high explosives    
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=346) he has dropped on civilian populations one had 
thought that guilt was away however indirect    
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=354) in which we might perceive the nature of reality 
and the laws which govern our human experience    
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=362) but it is now an illness that can be 
cured death however remains incurable    
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=370) though we might be embarrassed by victorian death 
bed scenes or the practices of mourning people    
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=376) a morning among people less sophisticated than 
ourselves the fact of death tells us so much    
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=383) about the realities of our condition that to 
ignore it or try to forget it is to be unaware    
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=390) of the most important thing we need to know 
about our situation as living creatures    
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=398) equally to witness and participate in 
the dying of our fellow men and women    
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=403) is to learn what we are and if we have 
any wisdom at all to draw conclusions    
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=410) which must in their way affect our 
every thought and our every act  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=419) it speaks for itself  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=423) and in a much much shorter passage back 
in the islam and destiny a man book    
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=428) he says religion cannot survive whole 
and effective when it is confined to one    
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=436) single compartment of life and education death is 
either all or it is nothing either it dwarfs all    
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=447) profane studies or it is dwarfed by them i really 
like that statement the theology used to be called    
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=455) of course the queen of the sciences uh and now 
of course it's uh threatened to be abolished in    
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=461) many university uh departments in the uk anyway 
but he says religion cannot survive whole and    
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=468) effective when it's confined to one part of life 
like you know your leisure time what you do on the    
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=473) weekend or something is either everything or it's 
nothing the muslims get this christians used to    
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=480) get this not anymore i tend to find but muslims 
if there's one thing that muslims can teach the    
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=486) west and teach christians too is that religion is 
either everything and not just a private thing but    
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=493) includes politics it includes uh divine law and 
our spirituality and everything all it is nothing    
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=500) anyway on to another quote and this is this 
is a nice one one of the fundamental themes of    
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=508) the quran is man's flight from reality given the 
basic premise that god is and that his being both    
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=517) transcends and encompasses all existence 
then unbelief is precisely such a flight    
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=525) men and women throughout the centuries have tried 
at every opportunity to evade total reality and to    
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=532) take refuge in little corners of private darkness 
even at the simplest everyday level there is    
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=539) constant avoidance of the thought of death 
there is evasion of our inward solitaryness    
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=546) which no amount of conviviality can entirely 
overcome and there is a refusal to acknowledge our    
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=554) limitations and our sins not only is it the innate 
tendency of fallen man to forget god but there    
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=563) comes about a luxuriant growth of forgetfulness 
in every sphere wow powerful words powerful words  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=576) i like this one this is uh particularly good just 
one sentence from islam and the destiny of man    
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=584) there are strengths and virtues in a 
polygamous marriage as there are in a    
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=590) monogamous one and it was muhammad's destiny 
to demonstrate both in their perfection    
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=597) in that amazing their strengths and virtues in 
polygamous marriage as there are in monogamous    
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=603) ones but it was muhammad's destiny to demonstrate 
both in their perfection because he was married    
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=609) to his first wife for i think it was 25 years 
monogamously in a beautiful marriage and then    
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=616) after her sad demise he had polygamous marriages 
of course for various reasons often political  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=625) and here we have um a lovely uh paragraph from 
islam and the destiny of man about the quran    
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=634) the quran set on a shelf with other books has a 
function entirely different to theirs and exists    
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=642) in a different dimension wow what an opening 
sentence it moves an illiterate shepherd to tears    
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=649) when recited to him and it has shaped the lives 
of millions of simple people over the course of    
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=656) almost 14 centuries it has nourished some of the 
most powerful intellects known to the human record    
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=665) it has stopped sophisticates in their tracks and 
made saints of them and it has been the source of    
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=672) the most subtle philosophy and of an art which 
expresses its deepest meaning in visual terms    
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=681) it has brought the wandering tribes of mankind 
together in communities and civilizations upon    
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=688) which its imprint is apparent even 
to the most casual observer wow  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=698) and this next quote is about how do people imitate 
muhammad and he writes this in islam and the    
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=705) destiny of man to love muhammad is one thing but 
to imitate him to try to be like him is another    
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=714) he was the last messenger and the last prophet so 
how can we expect to imitate what by definition    
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=722) is unique and unrepeatable in the first place 
his virtues are to be imitated and they were    
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=730) providentially exemplified in the extraordinary 
variety of human experience through which he    
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=736) passed in his 62 years of life he was an orphan 
yet he knew the warmth of parental love through    
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=744) his grandfather's devoted care for him he was 
the faithful husband of one wife for many years    
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=751) and after her death the tender and considerate 
husband of many wives he was the father of    
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=758) children who gave him the greatest joy this world 
has to offer and he saw all but one of them die    
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=767) he had been a shepherd and a merchant when young 
and he became a ruler a statesman a military    
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=775) commander and a law giver he loved his native 
city and was driven from it into exile finally    
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=783) to return home in triumph and set an example 
of clemency which has no equal in human history    
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=793) not only do we know almost everything he did 
we know the exact manner in which he did it    
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=801) and that's some islam and the destiny of man 
i like that sentence where he writes guy eaton    
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=807) he loved his native city and was driven from it 
into exile he went to medina of course finally    
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=813) to return home in triumph and he set an example 
of clemency of mercy so when he had total power    
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=820) he could have crushed his enemies destroyed 
them killed them but he showed them mercy and    
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=827) guidance says this has no equal in human history 
absolutely extraordinary absolutely extraordinary    
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=836) and just a couple more because i could go on 
over hours uh two more short ones and this    
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=841) again is typical of guy eaton's just amazing 
ability to write brilliant prose condensed    
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=847) spiritually powerful and and a way to change 
our perceptions of reality and this is this is    
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=853) one such example from islam in the destiny 
of man just a few brief sentences he writes    
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=860) the muslim does not feel dwarfed by the 
immensities of nature because he knows    
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=865) himself to be the vice regent of god standing 
upright in the midst of such immensities    
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=873) we those small in stature see the stars they do 
not see us we hold them within our consciousness    
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=883) and measure them in accordance with our knowledge 
they know us not we master them in their courses    
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=892) immensity cannot know itself only in human 
consciousness can such a concept exist wow  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=905) and maybe just one last one and this uh is quite 
hard hitting this one game from islam and the    
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=912) destiny of man about science and scientists if the 
term science has any precise meaning relating it    
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=921) to knowledge of the real then it is the science of 
tauheed it could be said and with good reason that    
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=928) the cafe should never be permitted to approach the 
physical sciences or to involve himself in them    
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=936) whoa what's going getting out here he does not 
possess the key to them and he is therefore    
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=942) bound to go astray and to lead others astray he 
divides when he should unite and his fragmented    
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=950) mind deals only with fragments it is little wonder 
that he splits the atom with devastating results    
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=961) those who know nothing of the principle 
are incompetent to study its manifestations    
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=967) then he quotes in the quran pursue not that of 
which thou hast no knowledge surely hearing and    
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=976) sight and heart all these shall be called to 
account that's surah 17 verse 36 powerful words    
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=986) we will never hear them anywhere in the media 
or in our orthodox knowledge uh extraordinary    
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=994) and then the penultimate one a beautiful paragraph 
this the sunnah of the prophet provides not only    
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=1003) a framework but also as it were a network 
of channels into which the believers will    
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=1010) enters and through which it flows smoothly both 
guided and guarded it is not his way the muslims    
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/LzlnZvWcHEs?t=1019) way to cut new channels for his volative life
