[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=3) In this video I just wanted to share with you 
some words of someone who has been called the    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=8) grandfather of British Islam his name is Gai Eaton 
and he sadly passed away just a few years ago he    
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=17) was a Muslim for over 50 years at the time of 
his death and he had a very distinguished career    
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=22) he was a British diplomat he was a consultant 
at regent's park mosque here in London    
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=28) and he was above all for me and a superb writer 
of the English language and he wrote some    
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=35) celebrated works which have had a profound effect    
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=38) on countless people particularly uh 
English-speaking people who are not    
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=42) Muslims and has led many of them to embrace 
Islam and perhaps his crowning work is this    
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=50) book called Islam and the destiny of man it 
was one of the first books I ever read actually    
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=56) before I became a Muslim and it had a profound 
impact on me and I do highly recommend it still.  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=71) I just want to read to you a short extract from 
this book where he discusses the significance    
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=77) of the Quran why is it such a special book 
and he gives his interpretation his views    
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=83) on this and I think what he has to say is very 
very interesting so I want just to share with you    
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=88) some words from his book and he begins this 
particular section on page 90 with some words    
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=95) in English from the Quran and he says and if all 
the trees on earth were pens and the sea with    
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=104) seven seas added were ink yet the words of Allah 
could not be exhausted that's the Quran 31 27    
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=114) and he continues for the Quran to contain more 
than a thimble full of the message it must rely    
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=122) upon images symbols and parables which are wind 
open windows onto a vast landscape of meaning    
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=132) but which are inevitably liable to 
misinterpretation the Prophet's wives once    
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=139) asked him which of them would be the first 
to die the one with the longest arm he said    
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=146) they set about measuring each other's arms with 
great seriousness and not until long afterwards    
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=153) did they understand that he meant the one 
who extended her arm furthest in acts of    
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=159) charity there have always been Muslims who like 
the prophet's wives have taken figures of speech    
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=167) literally and others who have maintained that the 
inner meaning of the text will be revealed to us    
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=173) only on the last day when the secrets of hearts 
are exposed together with the secrets of the book    
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=183) others again have regarded the literal meaning 
as a veil covering the majesty of the content    
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=189) and protecting it from profane eyes the disputes 
which have arisen on this subject lead nowhere    
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=198) and are therefore of no consequence each man 
must follow his way according to his nature    
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=207) but in whatever sense it may be understood 
superficially or in depth a scripture    
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=214) such as the Quran provides a rope of 
salvation for people of every kind    
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=221) the stupid as well as the intelligent and limited 
interpretations do not diminish its efficacy    
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=228) provided they satisfy the 
needs of particular souls    
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=234) no book of human authorship can be for everyone 
but this is precisely the function of a revealed    
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=242) scripture and for this reason it cannot be read 
in the way that works of human origin are read    
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=250) the sun and the moon are for everyone the 
rain too but their action in relation to    
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=257) each individual is different and ultimately 
to some they bring life and to some death    
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=267) it could be said that the quran 
is like these natural phenomena    
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=272) but it would be more exact to say that they are 
like the Quran they have one and the same author    
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=279) and are as it were illustrations 
inserted between the pages of the book.  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=287) It is an article of faith in Islam 
that the Quran is inimitable try as he    
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=294) may no man can write a paragraph which is 
comparable with a verse of the revealed    
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=300) book this has little to do with the literary merit 
of the text in fact a perfect work of literature    
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=310) could never be sacred precisely on account of 
the adequacy of its language to its content    
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=318) no conjunction of words however excellent 
could ever be adequate to a revealed content    
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=326) it is the efficacy of the words they're 
transforming and saving power that is inevitable    
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=335) since no human being can provide others with 
a rope of salvation made from strands of his    
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=343) own person and his own thoughts the quran set on 
a shelf with other books has a function entirely    
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=352) different to theirs and exists in a different 
dimension it moves an illiterate shepherd to tears    
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=361) when recited to him and it has shaped the lives 
of millions of simple people over the course of 14    
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=370) centuries it has nourished some of the most 
powerful intellects known to the human record    
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=377) it has stopped sophisticates in their tracks 
and made saints of them and it has been the    
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=384) source of the most subtle philosophy and of 
an art which expresses its deepest meaning    
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=392) in visual terms it has brought the wandering 
tribes of mankind together in communities and    
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=400) civilizations upon which its imprint is is 
apparent even to the most casual observer    
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=409) the Muslims regardless of race and national 
identity the Muslim is unlike anyone    
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=416) else because he has undergone the impact 
of the Quran and has been formed by it  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=426) other books are passive the reader 
taking the initiative but revelation    
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=432) is an act a command from on high comparable 
to a lightning flash which obeys no man's whim    
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=443) as such it acts upon those who are responsive 
to it reminding them of their true function as    
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=451) vice regents of god on earth restoring to them the 
use of faculties which have become atrophied like    
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=460) unused muscles and showing them not least by the 
example of the prophet what they are meant to be    
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=470) to say this is to say that revelation within the 
limits of what is possible in our fallen condition    
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=478) restores to us the condition of fitra 
it gives back to the intelligence    
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=486) its lost capacity to perceive and to 
comprehend supernatural truths gives back    
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=494) to the world its lost capacity to command the 
warring factions of the soul and it gives back    
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=503) to sentiment its lost capacity to love God 
and to love everything that reminds us of him  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=514) very powerful staring words there from 
this book by Gai Eaton and the book is    
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=519) like this from beginning to end it's 
the most extraordinary tour de force a    
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=523) one of the most beautiful books in the English 
language about any religion I would argue    
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/Osc1p4wW-v8?t=530) there is again Islam and the 
destiny of man, until next time.
