<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3')">0:00:03</a> In this video I just wanted to share with you 
some words of someone who has been called the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8')">0:00:08</a> grandfather of British Islam his name is Gai Eaton 
and he sadly passed away just a few years ago he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('17')">0:00:17</a> was a Muslim for over 50 years at the time of 
his death and he had a very distinguished career    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('22')">0:00:22</a> he was a British diplomat he was a consultant 
at regent's park mosque here in London    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('28')">0:00:28</a> and he was above all for me and a superb writer 
of the English language and he wrote some    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('35')">0:00:35</a> celebrated works which have had a profound effect    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('38')">0:00:38</a> on countless people particularly uh 
English-speaking people who are not    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('42')">0:00:42</a> Muslims and has led many of them to embrace 
Islam and perhaps his crowning work is this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('50')">0:00:50</a> book called Islam and the destiny of man it 
was one of the first books I ever read actually    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('56')">0:00:56</a> before I became a Muslim and it had a profound 
impact on me and I do highly recommend it still.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('71')">0:01:11</a> I just want to read to you a short extract from 
this book where he discusses the significance    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('77')">0:01:17</a> of the Quran why is it such a special book 
and he gives his interpretation his views    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('83')">0:01:23</a> on this and I think what he has to say is very 
very interesting so I want just to share with you    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('88')">0:01:28</a> some words from his book and he begins this 
particular section on page 90 with some words    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('95')">0:01:35</a> in English from the Quran and he says and if all 
the trees on earth were pens and the sea with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('104')">0:01:44</a> seven seas added were ink yet the words of Allah 
could not be exhausted that's the Quran 31 27    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('114')">0:01:54</a> and he continues for the Quran to contain more 
than a thimble full of the message it must rely    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> upon images symbols and parables which are wind 
open windows onto a vast landscape of meaning    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('132')">0:02:12</a> but which are inevitably liable to 
misinterpretation the Prophet's wives once    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('139')">0:02:19</a> asked him which of them would be the first 
to die the one with the longest arm he said    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('146')">0:02:26</a> they set about measuring each other's arms with 
great seriousness and not until long afterwards    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('153')">0:02:33</a> did they understand that he meant the one 
who extended her arm furthest in acts of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('159')">0:02:39</a> charity there have always been Muslims who like 
the prophet's wives have taken figures of speech    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('167')">0:02:47</a> literally and others who have maintained that the 
inner meaning of the text will be revealed to us    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('173')">0:02:53</a> only on the last day when the secrets of hearts 
are exposed together with the secrets of the book    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183')">0:03:03</a> others again have regarded the literal meaning 
as a veil covering the majesty of the content    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('189')">0:03:09</a> and protecting it from profane eyes the disputes 
which have arisen on this subject lead nowhere    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> and are therefore of no consequence each man 
must follow his way according to his nature    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('207')">0:03:27</a> but in whatever sense it may be understood 
superficially or in depth a scripture    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> such as the Quran provides a rope of 
salvation for people of every kind    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('221')">0:03:41</a> the stupid as well as the intelligent and limited 
interpretations do not diminish its efficacy    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('228')">0:03:48</a> provided they satisfy the 
needs of particular souls    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234')">0:03:54</a> no book of human authorship can be for everyone 
but this is precisely the function of a revealed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('242')">0:04:02</a> scripture and for this reason it cannot be read 
in the way that works of human origin are read    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('250')">0:04:10</a> the sun and the moon are for everyone the 
rain too but their action in relation to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('257')">0:04:17</a> each individual is different and ultimately 
to some they bring life and to some death    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('267')">0:04:27</a> it could be said that the quran 
is like these natural phenomena    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> but it would be more exact to say that they are 
like the Quran they have one and the same author    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('279')">0:04:39</a> and are as it were illustrations 
inserted between the pages of the book.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> It is an article of faith in Islam 
that the Quran is inimitable try as he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('294')">0:04:54</a> may no man can write a paragraph which is 
comparable with a verse of the revealed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">0:05:00</a> book this has little to do with the literary merit 
of the text in fact a perfect work of literature    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> could never be sacred precisely on account of 
the adequacy of its language to its content    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> no conjunction of words however excellent 
could ever be adequate to a revealed content    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326')">0:05:26</a> it is the efficacy of the words they're 
transforming and saving power that is inevitable    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('335')">0:05:35</a> since no human being can provide others with 
a rope of salvation made from strands of his    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> own person and his own thoughts the quran set on 
a shelf with other books has a function entirely    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('352')">0:05:52</a> different to theirs and exists in a different 
dimension it moves an illiterate shepherd to tears    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('361')">0:06:01</a> when recited to him and it has shaped the lives 
of millions of simple people over the course of 14    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('370')">0:06:10</a> centuries it has nourished some of the most 
powerful intellects known to the human record    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('377')">0:06:17</a> it has stopped sophisticates in their tracks 
and made saints of them and it has been the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('384')">0:06:24</a> source of the most subtle philosophy and of 
an art which expresses its deepest meaning    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('392')">0:06:32</a> in visual terms it has brought the wandering 
tribes of mankind together in communities and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('400')">0:06:40</a> civilizations upon which its imprint is is 
apparent even to the most casual observer    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('409')">0:06:49</a> the Muslims regardless of race and national 
identity the Muslim is unlike anyone    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('416')">0:06:56</a> else because he has undergone the impact 
of the Quran and has been formed by it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> other books are passive the reader 
taking the initiative but revelation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('432')">0:07:12</a> is an act a command from on high comparable 
to a lightning flash which obeys no man's whim    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> as such it acts upon those who are responsive 
to it reminding them of their true function as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> vice regents of god on earth restoring to them the 
use of faculties which have become atrophied like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('460')">0:07:40</a> unused muscles and showing them not least by the 
example of the prophet what they are meant to be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('470')">0:07:50</a> to say this is to say that revelation within the 
limits of what is possible in our fallen condition    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('478')">0:07:58</a> restores to us the condition of fitra 
it gives back to the intelligence    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> its lost capacity to perceive and to 
comprehend supernatural truths gives back    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('494')">0:08:14</a> to the world its lost capacity to command the 
warring factions of the soul and it gives back    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('503')">0:08:23</a> to sentiment its lost capacity to love God 
and to love everything that reminds us of him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('514')">0:08:34</a> very powerful staring words there from 
this book by Gai Eaton and the book is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('519')">0:08:39</a> like this from beginning to end it's 
the most extraordinary tour de force a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('523')">0:08:43</a> one of the most beautiful books in the English 
language about any religion I would argue    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('530')">0:08:50</a> there is again Islam and the 
destiny of man, until next time.
