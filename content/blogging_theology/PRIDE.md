[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=1) Hassan Shibly an American lawyer has just 
published the following on his Facebook page:    
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=7) 'We either believe in God or we don't. If we do 
we must allow our sins and struggles to humble    
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=16) us. We cannot claim to love God and celebrate Pride 
in that which he has forbidden in the Torah, Gospel,    
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=25) and the Qur'an. To refuse to celebrate Pride is not 
to be hateful but to be sincere and authentic to    
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=34) Abrahamic faith values. Belief in the God of 
Abraham necessitates belief in a moral code,    
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=41) in accountability in the hereafter, in Right and 
Wrong. We cannot cherry pick beliefs. In short,    
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=51) I simply cannot reconcile people of faith 
celebrating Pride in anything condemned by God.    
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=59) You can have mercy, show compassion, resist hate 
crimes, and keep an open door to all people    
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=65) regardless of their sins and struggles, without 
going so far as to celebrate those sins.    
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=73) May our source of pride only be our connection 
and devotion to God alone. May we never find    
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=81) pride in anything but Him and 
may that pride translate into    
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/f3iGNyqz4Kk?t=88) us being a source of mercy and guidance for His 
creation and obedience unto Him.' Till next time.
