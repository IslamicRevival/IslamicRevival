[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=1) i've always found it interesting to 
consider historically how jesus became a god .  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=7) and this particularly interesting work 
by two yale professors "king and messiah as    
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=15) son of god divine human and angelic messianic 
figures in biblical and related literature"   
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=22) this is an academic book written by scholars 
obviously for scholars and students of the new    
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=28) testament but these two yale professors  
describe the historical process by which    
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=36) jesus became a god . i just wanted to read 
a couple of paragraphs from a chapter i'll    
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=43) just read the text it is an academic language and 
then i'll make some interpretive comments on it    
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=49) and try and unpack what they are saying so bear 
with me as i read the text and then hopefully    
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=54) i'll make it clearer what i think they're getting 
at . i'm reading from a page 174 and the     
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=62) subheading here is the issue of worship : one of 
the key questions they say in the debate about the    
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=68) divinity of jesus has been whether he is worshiped 
in a way that principle agents of god are not .  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=78) it is difficult to distinguish ancient 
texts and practices expressing political   
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=83) submission and respect on the one hand 
from practices that we will call religious    
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=89) which express worship and devotion on the other 
if jesus was seen as taking over god's functions    
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=97) as king , warrior and judge at the 
End (with a capital "E") as god's agent    
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=104) his divinity may have been perceived 
primarily in functional terms at first    
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=110) but the idea of a heavenly messiah opens the door 
to speculation and rhetoric about pre-existence .  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=117) the notion of pre-existence intensifies the divine 
status of the heavenly messiah , similarly the    
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=124) honorific recognition as god's son is intensified 
in language about a virginal conception .  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=133) the cultural environment must also be taken 
into account . in the hellenistic ruler cults and    
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=141) especially in the imperial cults men who were once 
human beings were honored and worshipped as gods .  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=150) some were even worshipped as gods during their 
earthly lifetimes . the messiah of israel was    
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=155) conceived at first primarily as a king of his own 
nation first of all and then of the whole world .  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=165) the understanding of jesus that emerged after his 
resurrection involved his kingship over israel and    
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=172) over the entire world . given the practices of 
imperial cults , it is not surprising that jesus    
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=179) was viewed as a god and that worship of him became 
an alternative to the worship of the emperor .  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=188) end quote . so that's quite a tightly packed 
academic bit of analysis there . going back to    
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=195) the first paragraph one of the key questions 
about the divinity of jesus has been whether he    
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=200) is worshiped in a way that principle agents of 
god are not , so in other words is there something    
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=206) special about the divinity of the worship of 
jesus that is unique and quite different from    
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=213) the way that other agents of god were worshiped 
in a secondary sense not in the worship    
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=218) given to the one true god . and you talk about the 
difficulty of distinguishing in ancient texts    
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=224) and their practices . the differences between 
the political submission and respect    
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=231) on the one hand that's given to say a ruler and 
on the other what we would call now religious  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=239) worship . now there's a footnote here and this is 
where it goes into the greek : the use of the verb    
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=246) proskunéō in the book of revelation 
with god and the lamb as objects (proskunéō  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=254) is sometimes translated as worship so in the book 
of revelation god and the lamb meaning jesus are    
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=261) objects of worship) and then the same word is 
used with the community in philadelphia    
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=268) also as the object of proskunéō in chapter 
three verse nine , is a case in point they say .  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=277) so the verb proskunéō 
(to worship) can have a political meaning    
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=284) even to the community in philadelphia and 
revelation 3 9 as well as be used in a more    
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=290) religious sense of worship . so then they 
talk about how jesus was first the king of    
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=299) israel this is after the ascension of jesus 
and then how his kingship was extended globally    
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=307) later on , but what i find particularly interesting 
in this paragraph is the penultimate paragraph , it    
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=312) says : the cultural environment must also be taken 
into account when we discuss the issue of worship    
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=318) was jesus worshipped as god . and 
they talk about the hellenistic ruler cults  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=324) these are the the ruler cults in the greater 
roman world particularly the imperial cards to    
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=329) do with the roman emperor himself where men 
(emperors) who were once human beings were honored    
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=336) subsequently and worshipped as god . sometimes at 
their death the senate would in an honorific    
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=343) way say that they are now divine . but some were 
worshipped as gods even during their own lifetimes    
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=350) and they say : the messiah of israel jesus was 
conceived at first primarily as a king of his own    
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=356) nation israel and then of the whole world . and they 
say that : the understanding of jesus that emerged    
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=363) in the church after his resurrection ascension 
given the practices of the imperial roman cults .  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=372) it's not surprising that as the gospel 
spread outside of israel into the great    
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=378) roman world mainly through the preaching of 
paul of course and the hellenistic christians    
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=383) not surprising that jesus also came 
to be viewed as a god and that worship was given    
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=388) to him as an alternative to the worship of the 
emperor . so this is how they say it's    
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=397) important that we look at the historical and 
cultural environment in the development of the    
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=401) worship of jesus as a god in the first century .
there's a fascinating little footnote here in  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=408) the next chapter . chapter eight when the 
authors of this book are talking about how    
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=416) to translate the third clause of john 
1 1. this is john's gospel chapter one verse one .  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=422) and the word was god in the beginning was the 
word and the word was with god and the word was    
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=427) god is the traditional christian translation .
they say john 1 1 may be translated either  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=434) the word was god or the word was a god the 
word was a god . and then the footnote here   
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=443) talks about someone B.A. Mastin considers it 
overwhelmingly probable that john 1 1 describes    
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=452) the pre-existent logos as god in a particular work .
this conclusion though (they say) however is based  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=460) on his view that thomas's acclamation in john 20 
28 . you remember where thomas acclaims jesus    
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=468) my lord and my god yeah an extraordinary statement .
so they say that : thomas's acclimation in 20 28    
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=477) is the one verse in the new testament which 
does unquestionably describe christ as god    
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=482) but they criticize this view . this view fails to 
recognize however that the phrase dominus edeus    
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=490) and presumably its greek equivalent is an 
honorific exclamation used for example by    
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=497) those who wish to flatter domitian ( domitian is 
the roman emperor) . so what are they saying here  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=503) that they're saying : my lord and my god they're 
saying that john at the end of the first century    
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=508) is calling has thomas a claim to jesus my 
lord and my god which in latin is dominus deus .  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=517) this is an honorific acclamation known to being 
used by those at that time in the end of the    
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=524) first century who wish to flatter domitian . 
domitian was a roman emperor of course . so what  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=529) john is doing , he's saying no jesus is the lord 
and god not the roman emperor . so but of course the    
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=538) roman emperor wasn't really the absolute one high 
god of the universe he wasn't yahweh he wasn't    
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=545) the original . no one thought that he was zeus in 
an absolute sense . it was an honorific title . it  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=552) was given to flatter him (the flash of the roman 
emperor) oh you're so marvelous you are the king    
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=556) you are the lord and god but they 
didn't really think that he was zeus or yahweh .  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=563) in the same way on the lips of thomas , thomas 
is saying in effect : no jesus is dominus edeus    
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=572) not the roman emperor . so in a similar way we 
shouldn't take these words in the strongest    
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=578) sense of actually asserting that jesus is yahweh 
no that's not quite what's going on here .  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=584) it's the greek gospel equivalent or 
the title that was known to be used to flatter  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=591) the roman emperor and that's what the gospel 
writer is using that term to make his own point .  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=597) that kind of makes sense . so i think these 
two writers i'll just perhaps say a bit    
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=604) more about them one is Adela Yarbro Collins professor 
of new testament criticism interpretation at yale    
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=610) university . the other is John J. Collins professor 
of old testament criticism interpretation at yale    
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=616) university . i get the impression they are a 
married couple have an extraordinary marriage    
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=619) one is professor in the new testament . the other is a  
professor in the old testament both at yale . they    
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=624) both co-authored this . so the chapters to do 
with the old testament written by one person    
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=628) and the new testament by the other person
in the marriage so to speak .  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=635) but these are world-class experts and they 
clearly see the issue of worship    
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=642) we need to take into the cultural environment 
take that into account when we understand    
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=649) why gentile christians ultimately came to 
worship jesus as god as a counterpoint    
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=656) as a way of saying no we don't we're not going to 
worship the emperor we're going to worship jesus .  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=661) you know he is our king but of course this is 
a later development it's not something that    
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=666) we find in the earliest jesus tradition . the 
evidence suggests that wasn't present at all .  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=673) so as they say in the last sentence 
given : the practice of the imperial    
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=677) cults (the roman imperial cults) it's not 
surprising that jesus was viewed as a god    
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=682) and that worship of him became an alternative to 
the worship of the roman emperor . so that's their    
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/EyFB37JK-m0?t=690) insight . i think that's quite an astute comment 
and yeah what do you think . till next time
