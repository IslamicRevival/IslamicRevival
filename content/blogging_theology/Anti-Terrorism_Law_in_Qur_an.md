**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBWaX7juDGI&t=0)** The ruling called Hiraba in Arabic applies to crimes committed by armed individuals or groups against civilians, whether they be Muslim or non-Muslim. The Quran says that the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and his messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This penalty is a disgrace for them in this world and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the hereafter. Those who repent before you seize them will know that Allah is all-forgiving, most merciful.
