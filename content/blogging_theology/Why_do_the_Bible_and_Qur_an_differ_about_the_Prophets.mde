The video discusses the ways in which the Quran's portrayal of prophets and patriarchs differs from that of the Bible. argues that the Quran is more concerned with well-known accounts of the Bible's principle characters than with the Bible itself. He provides quotes from the Qur'an to illustrate his point.

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=2) the quran has a great deal to say about the 
patriarchs and the prophets sent to previous    
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=7) peoples especially to the israelites but in 
telling its version of these stories sometimes    
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=13) the narrative is very similar to the bible 
and sometimes it's radically different and    
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=19) i want to explore why this might be the case 
with the help of this book the bible in arabic    
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=27) the scriptures of the people of the book in the 
language of islam by sydney h griffith who is    
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=34) professor in the department of semitic 
and egyptian languages and literatures    
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=38) at the catholic university of america this is 
quite a new book and it has some rave reviews on    
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=47) the back by leading scholars for example from 
yale university it says the bible in arabic    
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=53) represents the work of a scholar at the height 
of his powers griffith demonstrates widespread    
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=59) mastery of his subjects his expertise spans 
not only christian arabic translation and    
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=64) interpretation of the bible but also jewish and 
islamic arabic literature as well the result is a    
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=70) book that fills a conspicuous gap in our knowledge 
it will surely become a standard in the field    
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=77) that's from steve davis who is a professor at yale 
university so i just want to share with you what    
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=84) griffith says uh about this uh because i think he 
has some fascinating uh ideas his hypotheses are    
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=91) very compelling i think although obviously you can 
disagree about why the stories of moses abraham    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=99) and david and job and so on are similar in uh to 
what we find in the bible yet sometimes they're    
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=105) different and what's really going on here why is 
the quran different from the bible about these    
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=110) patriarchs and prophets and griffith comes up with 
a plausible uh view i think so i'm just going to    
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=116) read some uh extracts from chapter 2 the bible in 
the arabic quran and i'll be making some comments    
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=123) as always on root the quran is a very is very 
conscious of the bible and sometimes presents    
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=130) itself as offering once again a revelation 
previously sent down in the torah and the gospel    
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=137) one verse even seems to put the quran on a par 
with these earlier scriptures when it speaks of    
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=142) the promise of paradise for those who fight in 
the way of god as already truthfully recorded    
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=148) in the torah the gospel and the quran that's the 
the ninth chapter verse 111. on the other hand    
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=156) the kran's text insistently recalls the earlier 
biblical stories of the patriarchs and prophets    
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=163) and even appeals to the books of the torah 
the prophets the psalms and the gospel by name    
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=169) on the other hand islamic scripture also pursues 
a reading of its own and often noticeably distinct    
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=176) from and sometimes even contrary to the biblical 
understanding of jews or christians for the quran    
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=183) is in fact very selective in its approach to 
the bible and to biblical law law spell lore    
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=191) it ignores entirely portions of the scriptures 
that are very important to jews and christians    
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=196) the new testament pauline epistles that's paul's 
letters are a notable instance of this disinterest    
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=203) they're completely ignored as are large portions 
of the former and later prophets in the hebrew    
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=209) bible what is noticeable is that the quran 
is not so much interested in the bible per se    
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=215) as it is in well-known accounts of the 
bible's principle characters a adam noah    
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=221) abraham ishmael isaac jacob joseph moses aaron 
miriam david solomon even job and jonah along    
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=228) with zechariah john the baptist mary and jesus son 
of mary just to mention the major personalities    
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=236) it interweaves recollection of this recollections 
of the stories of these patriarchs and prophets    
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=242) into its own distinctive prophetology this 
is a very griffith word prophetology his own    
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=249) understanding of the prophets the way it presents 
the prophets culminating in muhammad the messenger    
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=255) of god and the seal of the prophets in surah 
33 40. and in the presentation of god's message    
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=263) to the community of believers the prophet has 
summoned to hear it the quran thus appears on the    
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=268) horizon of biblical history as a new paradigm for 
the reading figuratively speaking of a familiar    
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=275) scriptural narrative in an arabic speaking milieu 
offering a new construal of a familiar salvation    
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=282) history albeit not without echoes of earlier 
traditions so that's uh sydney griffith setting    
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=289) up the chapter um i think he's he's more or less 
saying that the crime tells these familiar stories    
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=297) of moses and abraham and so on in its own way 
according to his own understanding of prophethood    
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=304) and there's more to come about this he continues 
at the end when he summarizes the chapter having    
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=311) looked at each of these prophets in turn and what 
the quran says and how it differs from the bible    
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=316) the quick review of quranic presentations of 
biblical patriarchs and prophets just rehearsed    
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=323) selective and schematic as it is nevertheless 
nevertheless makes three things fairly clear    
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=330) biblical personalities in their stories 
are recalled according to the paradigm    
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=335) of quranic prophetology and not according to 
jewish or christian narrative patterns the    
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=341) narratives are sometimes hauntingly close to the 
biblical versions but they frequently incorporate    
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=348) non-biblical jewish or christian apocryphal and 
traditional law l-o-r-e again and there are almost    
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=356) never any actual quotations from a known biblical 
text or for that matter from any other text    
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=363) these observations give rise to three preliminary 
conclusions the sources of the quran's biblical    
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=370) and traditional reminiscences are oral the 
quran's recollections of the biblical patriarchs    
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=376) and prophets according to the paradigm of its 
own prophetology bespeaks the arabic scriptures    
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=384) corrective even polemical stance towards jewish 
and christian scriptures and traditional law lore    
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=393) so what he's saying here is put it in simpler 
english because it's a very academic book this    
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=398) is not what's not meant for the the daily mail 
reader or something um what he's saying is that    
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=402) the quran obviously retells these same stories 
according to his own understanding of prophethood    
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=409) but it it does it not just summarizing or 
paraphrasing what's in the bible it corrects    
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=415) it it corrects the biblical stories it talks about 
even polemical stance towards jewish and christian    
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=421) scriptures it clearly views these scriptures as 
distorted as not speaking the whole truth about    
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=427) moses abraham david and so on so this is what the 
the quran is doing it has it has this corrective    
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=435) polemical relationship with the previous 
scriptures and he continues and giving the lack    
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=442) of actual quotations from the bible the presence 
of the bible in the quran is not textual in other    
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=448) words it's not quoting chunks in the bible in its 
own words in its own words it is present but by    
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=455) way of illusion illusion and re-presentation so in 
other words it retells stories which sound eerily    
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=463) familiar to us if we know the bible well the 
other hand they they sound different as well but    
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=469) the reason is the quran is correcting the bible 
the stories according to sydney clifford's here  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=477) so um the last part i want to read 
is the last paragraph of the chapter    
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=486) uh entitled the bible encountered in the quran 
the bible is both in the quran and not in the    
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=494) quran that is to say it has virtually no 
textual presence he says virtually because    
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=499) arguably there is a single verse from 
assam that is quoted in the quran    
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=507) that is to say it has virtually no textual 
presence but the selective presence of an    
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=512) interpreted bible in islamic scripture is 
undeniable and the selection process involved    
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=518) in the inclusion of biblical reminiscences in the 
quran according to the hypothesis advanced here    
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=526) is one determined by the quran's own 
distinctive prophetology that is to say    
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=531) recollections of biblical patriarchs and prophets 
and references to the earlier scriptures that tell    
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=537) their stories appear as integral components of the 
quran's advancement of its own prophetic message    
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=545) and what is more the quran is corrective 
of and even polemical towards the earlier    
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=551) readings of the scripture people that's 
jews and christians to the point that it    
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=556) can even accuse jews of distorting 
the scripture of god sent to them    
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=561) and then he gives some quotes from the quran this 
dimension of the quran's reprise of the bible    
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=568) bespeaks the opening of a new book altogether in 
the growing library of books on the interpreted    
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=575) bible or perhaps it bespeaks not so much a 
new book as a corrected alternative scripture    
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=582) one that recalls the tanakh and the bible but 
ultimately rejects them in the forms in which    
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=588) jews and christians actually have them 
it is no wonder then that for the letter    
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=593) but that for the later muslim scholars there 
was for the most part little interest over the    
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=599) centuries in the bible as the jews or christians 
actually have it the quran has made it irrelevant  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=609) which is very very interesting my own personal 
analogy for this uh he talks about the this    
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=617) dimension of the quran's reprise of the bible 
bespeaks the opening of a new book or perhaps    
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=623) it bespeaks not so much an uber as a corrected 
alternative scripture what we're looking at to    
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=627) use a very different analogy is like you're 
updating your software from particularly a a    
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=634) software computer that may have just about worked 
but nevertheless was riddled with problems and    
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=639) distortions and you came a lot and you replaced it 
with an ac pc software system i'm not mentioning    
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=645) apple here or my own macbook pro one that doesn't 
crash one that's not uh you know messed up    
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=651) and uh that's a very crude analogy here i think 
uh the quran is the pristine replacement for a    
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=658) scripture that has been changed and misinterpreted 
and partially lost or forgotten and so on although    
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=663) it still retains some of its uh integrity in 
that is speaking of moses and abraham and so on    
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=671) so i think that that would be my own kind of 
rough reinterpretation of what griffith is saying    
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=677) um so that that explains i think and i find this 
personally i find this plausible this explains why    
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=682) uh there are these differences why 
uh the crown's presentation of moses    
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=687) as a righteous man is so different from the 
bloodthirsty killer that is presented in the    
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=692) bible someone who commands in the name of god 
that women and children should be killed we    
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=698) would not find that in islam of course at all 
finally um there's a little footnote by way of    
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=704) uh parenthesis here uh fitness footnote 64 by 
issa the name of isa which i find fascinating    
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=710) and he says of the many explanations for the form 
of jesus's name as it appears in the quran what's    
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=717) the origin where is this why is it issa the most 
reasonable one from this writer's point of view    
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=723) is that it reflects an arabic speaker's spelling 
of what he hears in an arabic articulation of the    
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=732) common eastern syria syrian form of the name issue 
i-s-h-o i-s-h-o so it's an arabic understanding    
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=742) of the common syrian form and of course the 
syrian form is the aramaic form as well so    
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=751) i do recommend this book very much it is a 
heavyweight academic tome no worse for that    
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=758) it has rave reviews as i say from academics in 
the field and i think it plausibly uh advances    
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=764) the case which has been believed i think by 
muslims most muslims throughout the centuries    
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=769) that the the quran uh corrects uh and gives 
you the truth about the uh the stories of    
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=776) the people of the moses and abraham jesus and so 
on and it frees it from the corruptions that um    
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/vIfz9zrAf4E?t=783) have crept into these scriptures that 
christians and jews have today until next time
