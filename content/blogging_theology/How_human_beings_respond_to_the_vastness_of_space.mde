The author discusses how westerners and Muslims perceive the vastness of space differently. Westerners typically feel insignificant in the face of the vastness, while Muslims readily acknowledge their insignificance before God. The author attributes this difference to different perspectives on the natural world. For the westerner, nature is dominated by man, while for the Muslim, the universe is filled with beings created for man's benefit.

[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=11) the hugeness of the universe and the two  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=14) different responses to this  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=16) vastness that we find in the western  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=19) occidental tradition as it's called  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=21) and amongst muslims typically and i want  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=24) to read a brief passage from

[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=32) finished it i had become a muslim at  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=34) least in my heart  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=35) if not in my i hadn't said a creed at  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=38) that point  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=39) a hugely uh powerful book beautifully  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=42) written probably the most beautiful book  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=44) in english on islam i think  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=48) but i just want to read a few paragraphs  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=50) from this about the immensity  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=53) of space and guy eaton  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=57) says the following among the countless  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=60) comedies of misunderstanding which are  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=62) which can arise between men of two of  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=65) different  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=66) cultures none is more frustrating than  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=68) the situation  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=69) in which two people say the same thing  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=72) in almost the same words  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=74) and mean quite different things by what  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=76) they say  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=77) the occidental by which he means the  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=80) westerner the typical westerner  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=82) looking up at the night sky and  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=84) reflecting on  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=85) astronomical space will confess  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=88) sometimes with a shiver how  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=90) insignificant he feels in the midst of  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=93) such distances  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=95) the muslim readily acknowledges his  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=97) insignificance before god  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=101) but he never feels alone in an alien  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=103) universe  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=104) the muslim will also say that the  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=106) natural world was created for man  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=109) the westerner agrees with enthusiasm and  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=112) proceeds to tear  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=114) up the earth with his bulldozers  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=117) the muslim does not feel dwarfed by the  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=119) immensities of nature because he knows  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=122) himself to be the vice regent of god  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=125) standing upright in the midst of these  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=127) entities  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=129) we those small in stature see the stars  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=133) they do not see us we behold  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=137) we hold them within our consciousness  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=140) and measure them in accordance with our  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=142) knowledge  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=143) they know us not we master them  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=146) in their courses immensity  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=149) cannot know itself only in human  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=152) consciousness  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=153) can such a concept exist  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=156) in this sense man is the eye of god  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=160) and is therefore the measure of all  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=161) things and they  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=163) far from being alien and therefore  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=165) menacing have existence within  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=168) our awareness of them and are therefore  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=171) like extensions of our being  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=175) i think that's a beautiful almost poetic  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=177) summary of a different kind of  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=179) the different perceptions a different  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=180) ethos that infuses  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=182) uh different perceptions of our  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=186) stature within the immensity of this  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=188) universe  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/24N6NJc15RM?t=189) i think it's just beautifully put
