This video tells the story of the Prophet Muhammad's first marriage to Khadijah. Khadijah was already married and had two sons from her previous marriage, but she fell in love with Muhammad and asked her uncle to let them marry. Abu Talib agreed, but he also arranged for Muhammad to take care of Khadijah's business. Khadijah and Muhammad were married in 624 CE in Mecca. Khadijah was forty-nine and Muhammad was twenty-eight. After the marriage, Muhammad started to take care of her business and trade for her. One day, Khadijah sent Muhammad on a business trip to Syria. When Muhammad came back, he found out that Khadijah had married him to her other son, Maysara, without telling him. Muhammad was angry and decided to break up the marriage. However, unexpected circumstances led him to change his mind and he married Khadijah in 628 CE.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoCqGJZvglQ&t=0)**  Martin Lings tells the story of the Prophet Muhammad's first marriage to Khadijah. Khadijah was already married and had two sons from her previous marriage, but she fell in love with Muhammad and asked her uncle to let them marry. Abu Talib agreed, but he also arranged for Muhammad to take care of Khadijah's business. Khadijah and Muhammad were married in 624 CE in Mecca. Khadijah was forty-nine and Muhammad was twenty-eight. After the marriage, Muhammad started to take care of her business and trade for her. One day, Khadijah sent Muhammad on a business trip to Syria. When Muhammad came back, he found out that Khadijah had married him to her other son, Maysara, without telling him. Muhammad was angry and decided to break up the marriage. However, unexpected circumstances led him to change his mind and he married Khadijah in 628 CE.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoCqGJZvglQ&t=300)** Masara reports that the monk who greeted Muhammad when he arrived in Syria was Nestor, who recognized him as a prophet. According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad is the last prophet of the line of Judah. When they arrived in Mecca, Muhammad and Khadijah went to the home of Khajiit trader Khadijah's father. While there, Muhammad described his journey and the various transactions he made. Khadijah was able to sell her assets for more than double what she had paid for them. Muhammad's appearance and demeanor struck Khadijah as strange, and she was focused only on him while he was speaking. Muhammad was 25 years old and of medium stature. His hair and beard were thick and black, but not entirely straight. His hair reached midway between his ears and his shoulders, and his beard was of a length to match. His nose was aqualine and his mouth was wide and finely shaped. Muhammad had a noble breath and the ovals of his large eyes were wide with exceptionally long lashes and extensive brows.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoCqGJZvglQ&t=600)**  Khadijah, the first wife of the prophet Muhammad, is described as being strikingly beautiful with a light complexion and luminous eyes. She consults a woman friend, Nufatia, to ask if she can marry Muhammad. When Muhammad arrives, Khadijah tells him her story, including her love for him, her trustworthiness, and her kinship to him. She then offers herself as his wife, and they agree to speak to her uncle and her brother about the marriage. Hamza, the nephew of Khadijah's brother, Awam, is appointed as the representative for the family. After the agreement is made, Muhammad gives Khadijah 20 camels as a dowry.

[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=6) story of the prophet muhammad upon whom  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=8) the peace's first marriage and it's a  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=10) lovely story and i'm going to be reading  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=13) from muhammad his life based on the  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=15) earliest sources by martin lings chapter  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=19) 12 questions of marriage  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=23) muhammad had now passed his 20th year  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=26) and as time went on he received more and  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=29) more invitations to join one or another  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=33) of his kinsmen on their travels abroad  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=37) finally the day came when he was asked  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=39) to take charge of the goods of a  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=42) merchant who was unable to travel  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=44) himself  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=45) and his success in this capacity led to  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=49) other similar engagements  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=51) he was thus able to earn a better  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=54) livelihood and marriage became a  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=56) possibility  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=59) his uncle and guardian abu talib had at  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=62) that time three sons the eldest talib  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=66) was about the same age as muhammad  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=69) himself  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=70) akhil was 13 or 14 and jafar was a boy  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=74) of four  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=76) muhammad was fond of children and liked  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=79) to play with them  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=80) and he grew especially attached to jafar  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=83) who was a beautiful and intelligent  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=86) child  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=87) and who responded to his cousin's love  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=90) with a devotion that proved to be  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=92) lasting  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=94) abu talib also had daughters and one of  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=97) these was already of marriageable age  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=101) her name was fakita but later she was  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=105) called um hani  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=107) and it is by that name that she is  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=110) always known  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=112) a great affection had grown up between  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=114) her and muhammad who now asked his uncle  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=118) to let him marry her  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=121) but abu talib had other plans for his  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=124) daughter  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=126) his cousin who bera the son of his  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=129) mother's brother of the clan of maxim  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=132) had likewise asked for the hand of um  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=136) hani  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=137) and hubera was not only a man of some  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=140) substance but he was also like abu talib  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=144) himself a gifted poet  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=148) moreover the power of maxim in mecca was  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=152) as much on the increase as that of  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=154) hashim was on the wane  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=158) and it was to hubera that abu talev  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=161) married um hani  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=164) while his nephew mahdi reproached him he  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=167) simply replied they have given us their  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=170) daughters in marriage no doubt referring  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=173) to his own mother  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=175) and a generous man must requite  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=178) generosity  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=180) the answer was unconvincing in as much  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=183) as abd al-muttalib had already more than  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=186) repaid the debt in question by marrying  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=188) two of his daughters  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=190) atika and bara to men of maxim  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=195) muhammad no doubt took his uncle's words  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=198) as a courteous and kindly substitute for  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=201) telling him plainly that he was not yet  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=204) in a position to marry  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=207) that at any rate is what he now decided  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=210) for himself  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=212) but unexpected circumstances were soon  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=215) to induce him to change his mind  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=220) one of the richer merchants of mecca was  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=222) a woman khadijah  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=224) daughter of kuwalid of the clan of assad  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=229) she was first cousin to warricka the  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=232) christian  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=234) and his sister kutayla and like them she  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=237) was a distant cousin to the sons of  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=240) hashem  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=241) she had already been married twice  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=244) and since the death of her second  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=246) husband it had been her custom to hire  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=249) men to trade on her  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=252) behalf now muhammad had come to be known  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=256) throughout mecca as al-amin  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=259) the reliable the trustworthy the honest  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=263) and this was initially owing to the  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=265) reports of those who had entrusted their  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=268) merchandise to him on various occasions  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=272) khadijah had also heard much good of him  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=275) from family sources and one day she sent  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=278) word to him asking him to take some of  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=281) her merchandise  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=282) to syria  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=284) his fee would be the double of the  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=286) highest she had ever paid to a man of  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=289) croatia  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=290) and she offered him for the journey the  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=292) services of a lad of hers named maysara  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=297) he accepted what she proposed and  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=299) accompanied by the lad  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=302) he set off with her goods for the north  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=306) when they reached bostra in the south of  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=309) syria muhammad took shelter beneath the  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=312) shadow of a tree not far from the cell  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=315) of a monk named nestor  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=319) since traveller's halts often remained  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=321) unchanged it could have been the  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=324) self-same tree under which he had  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=326) sheltered some 15 years previously on  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=330) his way through bostra with his uncle  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=333) perhaps bahira had died and been  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=336) replaced by nostra  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=338) however that may be for we only know  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=341) what masara reported  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=343) the monk came out of his cell and asked  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=346) the lad  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=347) who is the man beneath that tree  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=351) he is a man of quraish said masara  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=354) adding by way of explanation  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=357) of the people who have guardianship of  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=360) the sanctuary  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=363) none other than a prophet is sitting  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=365) beneath that tree said nestor  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=369) and martin lings in his biography here  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=371) as little footnote at the bottom which  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=373) is worth really worth reading out he  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=376) says  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=377) according to islamic tradition muhammad  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=380) is none other than the mysterious  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=382) shirloth  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=384) to whom could would be transferred  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=387) in the latter days the spiritual  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=389) authority which until then had remained  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=393) the prerogative of the jews  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=395) jesus himself having been the last  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=397) prophet of the line of judah  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=401) the prophecy in question was made by  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=404) jacob immediately before his death and  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=407) martin lingzen quotes in genesis chapter  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=410) 49 and i quote  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=412) and jacob called unto his sons and said  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=417) gather yourselves together that i may  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=419) tell you that which shall be for you in  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=422) the last days  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=424) the scepter shall not depart from judah  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=428) nor a law giver from beneath his feet  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=431) until  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=432) shiloh come  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=434) and unto him shall the gathering of the  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=437) people be  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=439) genesis chapter 49 fascinating prophecy  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=444) and then martin ling's continues  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=446) as they went on further into syria the  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=449) words of nestor sank deep into the soul  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=453) of masara but they did not greatly  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=456) surprise him for he had become aware  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=458) throughout the journey that he was in  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=460) the company of a man unlike any other he  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=464) had ever met  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=466) this was still further confirmed by  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=468) something he saw on his way home  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=472) he had often noticed that the heat was  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=474) strangely unoppressive  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=477) and one day towards noon in other words  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=480) the hottest part of the day  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=482) it was given to him to have a brief but  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=484) clear vision of two angels  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=487) shading muhammad from the sun's rays  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=491) wow  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=492) on reaching mecca they went to khajiit's  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=495) house with the goods they had bought in  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=497) the markets of syria for the price of  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=499) what they had sold  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=501) khadijah sat listening to muhammad as he  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=504) described the journey and told her of  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=507) the transactions he had made  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=510) these proved to be very profitable for  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=513) she was able to sell her newly acquired  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=515) assets for almost the double of what had  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=518) been paid for them  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=520) such but such considerations were far  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=524) from her thoughts for all her attention  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=527) was concentrated on the speaker himself  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=532) muhammad was 25 years old  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=535) he was of medium stature inclined to  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=539) slimness with a large head broad  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=541) shoulders and the rest of his body  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=544) perfectly proportioned  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=546) his hair and beard were thick and black  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=549) not altogether straight but slightly  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=552) curled  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=553) his hair  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=555) reached midway between the lobes of his  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=557) ears and his shoulders and his beard was  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=560) of a length to match  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=562) he had a noble breath of forehead and  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=565) the ovals of his large eyes were wide  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=569) with exceptionally long lashes and  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=571) extensive brows  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=573) slightly arched but not joined  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=577) in most of the earliest descriptions his  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=580) eyes are said to have been black but  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=583) according to one or two of these they  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=585) were brown even light brown  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=588) his nose was aqualine and his mouth was  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=591) wide and finely shaped a comeless always  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=595) visible for although he let his beard  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=598) grow  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=598) he never allowed the hair of his  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=600) moustache  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=602) to protrude over his upper lip  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=606) his skin was white but tanned by the sun  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=610) in addition to his natural beauty there  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=613) was a light on his face the same which  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=616) had shone from his father but in the sun  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=620) it was more powerful  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=622) and this light was especially apparent  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=625) on his broad forehead and in his eyes  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=628) which were remarkably luminous  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=632) khadijah knew that she herself was still  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=636) beautiful but she was 15 years his elder  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=640) would he nonetheless be prepared to  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=642) marry her  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=645) as soon as he was gone she consulted a  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=647) woman friend of hers named nuffelsha who  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=651) offered to approach him on her behalf  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=654) and if possible to arrange a marriage  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=657) between them  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=659) may sarah now came to his mistress and  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=662) told her about the two angels and what  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=665) the monk had said whereupon she went to  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=668) her cousin waraka  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=670) see he's a christian and repeated these  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=673) things to him  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=675) if this be true khadijah he said  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=678) then is muhammad the prophet of our  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=682) people  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=683) long have i known that a prophet is to  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=685) be expected and his time had now come  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=692) meanwhile nufisha came to muhammad and  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=695) asked him why he did not marry  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=698) i have not the means to marry he  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=701) answered  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=703) but if thou wert given the means she  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=705) said and if thou were bidden to an  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=708) alliance where there is beauty and  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=710) property and nobility and abundance  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=713) would thou not consent  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=716) who is she he said  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=718) khadijah said nufatia  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=722) and how could such a marriage be mine he  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=724) said  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=725) leave that to me was her answer  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=729) for my part he said i am willing  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=733) nafasia returned with these tidings to  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=736) khadijah who then sent word to muhammad  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=739) asking him to come to her  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=742) and when he came she said to him  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=745) son of mine uncle  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=748) i love thee for thy kinship with me and  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=751) for that thou art ever in the center not  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=755) being partisan among the people for this  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=758) or for that  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=760) and i love thee for thy trustworthiness  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=763) and for the beauty of thy character and  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=766) for the truth of thy speech  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=770) then she offered herself a marriage to  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=774) him and they agreed that he should speak  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=776) to his uncles and she would speak to her  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=780) uncle amma the son of assad  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=784) for kuwait hid her  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=786) for kuala her father had died  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=790) it was hamza despite his relative youth  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=793) whom the hashemites delegated to  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=795) represent them on this occasion no doubt  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=799) because he was the most closely  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=800) connected of them with the tribe of  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=803) assad  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=804) for his four sister safiya had recently  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=807) married khadija's brother awam  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=810) so hamza went with his nephew to amma  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=814) and asked for the hand of khadijah  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=818) and it was agreed between them that  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=821) muhammad should give her 20 she camels  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=824) as  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=825) dowry  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=827) and there ends that chapter a beautiful  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=829) story in the life of the prophet  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=831) muhammad upon whom be peace till next  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/CoCqGJZvglQ?t=834) time
