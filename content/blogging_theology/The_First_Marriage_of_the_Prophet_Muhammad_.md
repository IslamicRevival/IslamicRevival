This video tells the story of the Prophet Muhammad's first marriage to Khadijah. Khadijah was already married and had two sons from her previous marriage, but she fell in love with Muhammad and asked her uncle to let them marry. Abu Talib agreed, but he also arranged for Muhammad to take care of Khadijah's business. Khadijah and Muhammad were married in 624 CE in Mecca. Khadijah was forty-nine and Muhammad was twenty-eight. After the marriage, Muhammad started to take care of her business and trade for her. One day, Khadijah sent Muhammad on a business trip to Syria. When Muhammad came back, he found out that Khadijah had married him to her other son, Maysara, without telling him. Muhammad was angry and decided to break up the marriage. However, unexpected circumstances led him to change his mind and he married Khadijah in 628 CE.

Khadijah was already married and had two sons from her previous marriage, but she fell in love with Muhammad and asked her uncle to let them marry. Abu Talib agreed, but he also arranged for Muhammad to take care of Khadijah's business. Khadijah and Muhammad were married in 624 CE in Mecca. Khadijah was forty-nine and Muhammad was twenty-eight. After the marriage, Muhammad started to take care of her business and trade for her. One day, Khadijah sent Muhammad on a business trip to Syria. When Muhammad came back, he found out that Khadijah had married him to her other son, Maysara, without telling him. Muhammad was angry and decided to break up the marriage. However, unexpected circumstances led him to change his mind and he married Khadijah in 628 CE.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>** Masara reports that the monk who greeted Muhammad when he arrived in Syria was Nestor, who recognized him as a prophet. According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad is the last prophet of the line of Judah. When they arrived in Mecca, Muhammad and Khadijah went to the home of Khajiit trader Khadijah's father. While there, Muhammad described his journey and the various transactions he made. Khadijah was able to sell her assets for more than double what she had paid for them. Muhammad's appearance and demeanor struck Khadijah as strange, and she was focused only on him while he was speaking. Muhammad was 25 years old and of medium stature. His hair and beard were thick and black, but not entirely straight. His hair reached midway between his ears and his shoulders, and his beard was of a length to match. His nose was aqualine and his mouth was wide and finely shaped. Muhammad had a noble breath and the ovals of his large eyes were wide with exceptionally long lashes and extensive brows.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>**  Khadijah, the first wife of the prophet Muhammad, is described as being strikingly beautiful with a light complexion and luminous eyes. She consults a woman friend, Nufatia, to ask if she can marry Muhammad. When Muhammad arrives, Khadijah tells him her story, including her love for him, her trustworthiness, and her kinship to him. She then offers herself as his wife, and they agree to speak to her uncle and her brother about the marriage. Hamza, the nephew of Khadijah's brother, Awam, is appointed as the representative for the family. After the agreement is made, Muhammad gives Khadijah 20 camels as a dowry.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('94')">0:01:34</a> abu talib also had daughters and one of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('105')">0:01:45</a> called um hani  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('107')">0:01:47</a> and it is by that name that she is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('110')">0:01:50</a> always known  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('112')">0:01:52</a> a great affection had grown up between  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('114')">0:01:54</a> her and muhammad who now asked his uncle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('118')">0:01:58</a> to let him marry her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('121')">0:02:01</a> but abu talib had other plans for his

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('136')">0:02:16</a> hani  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> and hubera was not only a man of some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('140')">0:02:20</a> substance but he was also like abu talib  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> himself a gifted poet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('148')">0:02:28</a> moreover the power of maxim in mecca was

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('173')">0:02:53</a> to his own mother  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('175')">0:02:55</a> and a generous man must requite

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('180')">0:03:00</a> the answer was unconvincing in as much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183')">0:03:03</a> as abd al-muttalib had already more than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('186')">0:03:06</a> repaid the debt in question by marrying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('188')">0:03:08</a> two of his daughters

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('195')">0:03:15</a> muhammad no doubt took his uncle's words  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> as a courteous and kindly substitute for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('201')">0:03:21</a> telling him plainly that he was not yet

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('210')">0:03:30</a> for himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('212')">0:03:32</a> but unexpected circumstances were soon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('215')">0:03:35</a> to induce him to change his mind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('220')">0:03:40</a> one of the richer merchants of mecca was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('222')">0:03:42</a> a woman khadijah

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234')">0:03:54</a> and his sister kutayla and like them she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('237')">0:03:57</a> was a distant cousin to the sons of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('240')">0:04:00</a> hashem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('241')">0:04:01</a> she had already been married twice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('244')">0:04:04</a> and since the death of her second  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('246')">0:04:06</a> husband it had been her custom to hire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('249')">0:04:09</a> men to trade on her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('252')">0:04:12</a> behalf now muhammad had come to be known

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('263')">0:04:23</a> and this was initially owing to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('265')">0:04:25</a> reports of those who had entrusted their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> merchandise to him on various occasions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> khadijah had also heard much good of him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> from family sources and one day she sent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('278')">0:04:38</a> word to him asking him to take some of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('281')">0:04:41</a> her merchandise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> to syria  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('284')">0:04:44</a> his fee would be the double of the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('289')">0:04:49</a> croatia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('290')">0:04:50</a> and she offered him for the journey the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> services of a lad of hers named maysara  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('297')">0:04:57</a> he accepted what she proposed and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> accompanied by the lad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('302')">0:05:02</a> he set off with her goods for the north

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312')">0:05:12</a> shadow of a tree not far from the cell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('315')">0:05:15</a> of a monk named nestor

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> he had a noble breath of forehead and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('598')">0:09:58</a> he never allowed the hair of his

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('620')">0:10:20</a> it was more powerful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('622')">0:10:22</a> and this light was especially apparent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('625')">0:10:25</a> on his broad forehead and in his eyes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('628')">0:10:28</a> which were remarkably luminous

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('640')">0:10:40</a> would he nonetheless be prepared to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('642')">0:10:42</a> marry her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('645')">0:10:45</a> as soon as he was gone she consulted a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('651')">0:10:51</a> offered to approach him on her behalf  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('654')">0:10:54</a> and if possible to arrange a marriage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('657')">0:10:57</a> between them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('659')">0:10:59</a> may sarah now came to his mistress and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> told her about the two angels and what

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('668')">0:11:08</a> her cousin waraka  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('670')">0:11:10</a> see he's a christian and repeated these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('673')">0:11:13</a> things to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('675')">0:11:15</a> if this be true khadijah he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('678')">0:11:18</a> then is muhammad the prophet of our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('683')">0:11:23</a> long have i known that a prophet is to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('692')">0:11:32</a> meanwhile nufisha came to muhammad and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> asked him why he did not marry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('698')">0:11:38</a> i have not the means to marry he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('701')">0:11:41</a> answered  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('703')">0:11:43</a> but if thou wert given the means she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('705')">0:11:45</a> said and if thou were bidden to an

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('716')">0:11:56</a> who is she he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('718')">0:11:58</a> khadijah said nufatia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('722')">0:12:02</a> and how could such a marriage be mine he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('724')">0:12:04</a> said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('725')">0:12:05</a> leave that to me was her answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('729')">0:12:09</a> for my part he said i am willing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('733')">0:12:13</a> nafasia returned with these tidings to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('736')">0:12:16</a> khadijah who then sent word to muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('739')">0:12:19</a> asking him to come to her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('742')">0:12:22</a> and when he came she said to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('745')">0:12:25</a> son of mine uncle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('748')">0:12:28</a> i love thee for thy kinship with me and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('758')">0:12:38</a> or for that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('760')">0:12:40</a> and i love thee for thy trustworthiness

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('770')">0:12:50</a> then she offered herself a marriage to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('774')">0:12:54</a> him and they agreed that he should speak  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('776')">0:12:56</a> to his uncles and she would speak to her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('780')">0:13:00</a> uncle amma the son of assad
