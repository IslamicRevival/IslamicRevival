 discusses the controversial marriages of Prophet Muhammad, with Aisha being mentioned as an example. It is noted that, based on historical and cultural context, things look very different than how they are viewed in the present day, with marriage at puberty being a more appropriate norm for Muhammad's time.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVujj3YWdYU&t=0)* Discusses the controversial marriages of Prophet Muhammad, focusing on his marriages to Khadijah and Aisha. He also discusses Muhammad's marriages to his daughters.

No critic of Muhammad from his fiercest opponents in the quraish to medivh to medieval christian clerics objected to his marriage to see younger wife until the modern period. This is noteworthy, as there has never been a shortage of detractors seeking chinks in the armor of Muhammad's character to exploit his marriage to Zainab, his adopted son's former wife. The fact that Zayd is one of only two contemporaries of Muhammad ever mentioned in the Quran confirms the controversies surrounding his marriage. One of the earliest christian polemicists against Islam, John of Damascus, accused Muhammad of tailoring the Quranic laws on marriage and adoption to legitimize his desire for Zainab. This accusation has been repeated endlessly throughout christian writings on Islam, and certainly on YouTube and other places. Christians are still milking this story for all they can get in their desire to discredit the Prophet of Islam.

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=2) Perhaps more than any other feature of the 
prophet Muhammad's life, his marriages have    
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=7) proved controversial whether it be the marriage 
to Aisha at a very young age, or his polygamy,    
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=15) he married so many wives or his marriage to Zainab 
um this had caused well quite some scandal in some    
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=23) western particularly the last marriage to zainab 
has caused scandal almost from the very beginning    
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=29) so i just wanted to um look at some expert opinion 
on this from the west from western scholarship and    
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=36) i'm just wanted to read from this book called 
'Muhammed A Very Short Introduction, by Jonathan A    
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=42) C Brown, and this Very Short Introduction is 
part of a series of books for anyone wanting    
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=48) stimulating introductions to a new subject they're 
all written by experts chosen by Oxford University    
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=55) Press and they published in more than 25 languages, 
and they cover everything from advertising,    
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=61) african history, animal rights, anti-semitism, 
ethics, Galileo, galaxies - you name it they    
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=67) cover it! Sociology, socialism, 
theology, United Nations, paganism, cancer,    
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=73) the Vikings, witchcraft, you name it it's covered. 
So they picked a top expert to write this    
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=80) uh little book on Muhammad, and I do recommend it 
it's superb and and Jonathan A    
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=87) C Brown has written a section called 'Muhammad'S 
marriages in context', there's a very short section    
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=93) i just wanted to share with you. Who is Jonathan 
AC Brown? He's a professor of Islamic studies    
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=99) at Georgetown University in 
Washington DC. He's an American and he has     
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=107) published in the fields of hadith (his PhD was in 
hadith), Islamic law, Sufism, Arabic lexical theory,    
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=116) and pre-Islamic poetry. On the back it's got some 
rave reviews: John L. Esposito, who's a professor    
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=122) at Georgetown University, an expert on Islam, 
says "This is a masterful treatment informed by    
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=129) first-rate scholarship yet engaging, accessible, 
and distinctively different from previous books    
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=135) on Muhammad." So what does Jonathan AC Brown 
have to tell us about Muhammad's marriages in    
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=143) context? Well I think he shares, there's some 
quite interesting information to help really    
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=148) contextualize this whole subject in a very helpful 
way so more than any other feature of Muhammad's    
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=155) life his many marriages have consistently struck 
and bewildered western readers since the rise of    
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=162) islam the prophet's polygamy and the chronic 
ruling that muslim men can marry up to four women    
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=169) at a time the prophet was allowed more because 
it was believed that he would never mistreat    
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=175) any of his wives created early on in medieval 
christendom an image of muhammad as lustful    
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=183) prior to christianity however the near east 
from pharonic egypt to ancient mesopotamia    
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=190) was a world in which political polygamy was not 
foreign at all for most men it would have been    
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=196) too expensive but for rulers or men of great 
import it was an expectable tool of politics    
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=204) and propagation perhaps the most famous example 
exemplar for harem politics that's not haram    
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=211) but harem politics was king solomon whom the bible 
says had 700 wives and 300 concubines you can read    
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=220) all about that in one kings chapter 11. among 
them was the daughter of the pharaoh of egypt    
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=226) whom he had married to cement an alliance indeed 
looked at through a political lens muhammad's    
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=234) marriages worked towards clear political goals 
his marriage to khadijah of course had predated    
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=242) his prophethood and she remained 
his only wife until she died let    
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=248) us look at whom the prophet married after 
that and to whom he married his daughters    
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=254) muhammad married the daughters of abu bakr and 
umar and married his own daughters to uthman and    
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=261) ali these four men were the first four rulers 
of the muslim state after the prophet's death    
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=269) muhammad also married the daughter of abu sufyan 
as well as the sister of abbas's wife maymunna    
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=276) who was also the aunt of khalid bin al-walid the 
great general abu sufyan's son muawiwa founded the    
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=285) umayyad caliphate after ali's death in 660 ce 
and khalid was a leading general of the muslim    
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=293) armies the prophet's marriages and those of 
his family thus helped to create the network    
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=300) that provided the leadership of the muslim 
community in the century after muhammad's death    
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=307) the prophet also entered into other politically 
potent marriages he were the daughter of the    
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=314) jewish chief of khabar as well as numerous women 
from leading arab tribes the fact that we know    
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=322) nothing more than the tribal identities of 
two of these women further demonstrate that    
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=328) it was the political relationship that 
muhammad was fostering that mattered    
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=334) there is nothing more controversial to the modern 
reader than muhammad's marriage to aisha who is    
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=340) believed to have been between nine and ten years 
old when the marriage was consummated the most    
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=347) reliable historical sources on this marriage 
are the sahih hadith collections of al-bukhari    
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=354) and muslim interestingly no critic of muhammad 
from his fiercest opponents in the quraish    
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=362) to medivh to medieval christian clerics objected 
to his marriage to see younger wife until    
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=369) the modern period this is noteworthy since there 
has certainly never been a shortage of detractors    
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=377) seeking chinks in the armor of muhammad's 
character to exploit his marriage to zainab    
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=385) his adopted son's former wife which attracted 
criticism even during muhammad's own lifetime    
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=392) the fact that zayd is one of only two 
contemporaries of muhammad ever mentioned    
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=397) in the quran the other is abu lahab as well as 
the book's sizable passage on the zainab episode    
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=404) testifies to the controversies 
surrounding muhammad's marriage to her    
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=409) one of the earliest christian polemicists 
against islam john of damascus he died in 749    
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=417) accused muhammad of tailoring the quranic laws 
on marriage and adoption to legitimize his desire    
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=425) for zainab this accusation has been repeated 
endlessly throughout christian writings    
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=431) on islam and certainly on youtube and other 
places christians are still milking this    
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=436) story for all they can get in their desire to 
discredit the prophet of islam the 13th century    
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=443) english historian matthew paris for example 
wrote in his great chronicle that muhammad had    
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=449) pronounced polygamy permissible to cover up an 
affair with a servant presumably zade's wife    
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=458) the reason that no pre-modern critics paid 
attention to the prophet marriage prophet's    
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=463) marriage to a ten-year-old was because marrying 
girls considered underage today was commonplace    
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=471) in the pre-modern world it was a common reality 
then under roman law the earliest permitted age    
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=478) for marriage was 12. in the heyday of the roman 
empire that's the second century a.d by 14 a girl    
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=486) was considered an adult whose primary purpose 
was marriage in many pre-modern law codes such    
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=494) as the hebrew biblical law and the salic frankish 
law marriage age was not a question at all it was    
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=502) assumed that when a girl reached puberty and was 
able to bear children she was ready for marriage    
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=509) so basically the the biblical norm uh for marriage 
age of marriage was puberty whenever that might be    
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=517) as a result we find that average 
marriage ages in the pre-modern world    
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=522) were remarkably young surviving evidence from 
several centuries of imperial roman history    
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=530) suggests that as many as eight percent married 
at ten or eleven that's one in ten in italy in    
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=538) the thirteen hundreds and fourteen hundreds the 
average age for women was sixteen to seventeen    
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=544) even in the 1861 census in england over 
350 women married under the age of 15    
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=552) in just two counties that year according 
to both christian and muslim teachings    
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=558) the virgin mary was not the mature maternal figure 
seen in artwork about the bible she was at most in    
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=566) her mid-teens having only just begun menstruating 
and is reported to have been as young as 10 years    
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=574) old muhammad's decision to consummate his marriage 
to a ten-year-old would have been based on the    
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=581) same criteria as most pre-modern societies aisha's 
sexual maturity and readiness to bear a child    
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=591) consummation of the marriage would have occurred 
when she had menstruated and started puberty as    
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=598) the great muslim historian al tabari died 923 
reported at the time of her marriage contract    
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=606) aisha was young and not capable of intercourse 
three or four years later however she was able    
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=615) aisha herself would later remark that a girl 
can menstruate as young as nine and thus become    
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=623) a woman so i think i'll end the quote there so 
that's absolutely fascinating i think when you    
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=630) have a scholarly objective analysis of muhammad's 
marriages in their historical and cultural context    
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=638) things look very very different than our local 
very recent historical obsession with uh related    
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=645) issues like this so i think it's very very uh 
interesting and also the biblical norm as well uh    
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=651) marriage at puberty uh which would have mohammed's 
own marriages would have fitted in quite neatly    
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=656) with that paradigm as well so as i was saying i 
do uh recommend uh this book it is very short but    
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=662) it's packed full of useful scholarly and uh first 
first-rate scholarship as it says on the back here    
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=669) published by oxford university press it's quite 
cheap and have a look at the other items uh in    
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=674) their series as well i've learnt a great deal on 
many other subjects uh from experts in the field    
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/rVujj3YWdYU?t=679) who produce these little booklets so there we go 
i hope you found that interesting until next time
