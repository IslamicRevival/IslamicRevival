[0:00:00](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=0) what are the the top five worst verses in the 
quran ? well here is a list of the top five worst    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=8) verses in the quran . beware some of them are quite 
repulsive and truly frightening . here's one this is    
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=15) what allah says now go and strike the infidel 
and devote to destruction all that they have    
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=22) do not spare them but kill both men 
and women , child and infant ox and sheep    
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=28) camel and donkey . there's another verse that says :
happy is he who repays the infidel for what they    
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=35) have done to us . he who seizes their infants and 
dashes them against the rocks . another verse in the    
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=43) coran : so the man took his concubine and sent her 
outside to them and they raped her and abused her    
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=50) throughout the night and at dawn they let her go 
at daybreak the women went back to the house where    
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=55) her master was staying fell down at the door and 
lay there until daylight when her master got up in    
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=61) the morning and opened the door of the house and 
stepped out to continue on his way there lay his    
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=67) concubine falling in the doorway of the house 
with her hands on the threshold , he said to her :   
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=72) get up let's go . but there was no answer then the 
man put her on his donkey and set out for home .    
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=80) there's another verse : a wife must submit to her husband as to allah . and another verse :   
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=87) when a man sells his daughter as a slave she will 
not be freed at the end of six years as the men    
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=94) are if she does not please the man who bought 
her he may allow her to be bought back again .  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=102) well that is clearly true vile stuff and rather 
obvious proof that all muslims are wicked evil    
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=109) people right ? ask yourself this knowing that you 
now know that the above verses are in the quran    
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=115) how do you feel about the book ? perhaps you've 
actually read the quran and are already familiar    
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=121) with those verses . okay i have a confession to 
make , none of these verses actually exist in    
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=128) the quran at all as i'm sure muslims realized 
and i'm reading this from a website i came across    
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=134) skeptical science.com i think it's an 
anti-religious site but this article is very    
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=142) very good . so it's a clever way of
breaking open these stereotypes that people have .  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=150) let's look at the what he says is : none of these 
verses actually exist in the quran at all instead    
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=156) i took a few bible verses and simply injected the 
word allah instead of the word god and injected    
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=162) the word infidel to make it sound islamic . here 
are the those original bible verses . this is what    
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=169) the lord almighty says : now go and strike amalek 
and devote to destruction all that they have do    
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=175) not spare them but kill both men and women , child 
and infant ox and sheep camel and donkey that's    
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=182) 1 samuel 15 3 . and this is from pslam : happy is 
he who repays you for what you have done to us    
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=191) he who seizes your infants and dashes them against 
the rocks psalm 137 verse 9. there's another one    
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=199) in judges 19 : so the man took his concubine and 
set out another concubine story is in judges 19    
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=207) and then wives submit to your husbands as 
to the lord ephesians 5 22 . and then the last    
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=215) passage i read out was exodus 21 : when a man sells 
his daughter as a slave she will not be freed at    
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=223) the end of six years as the men are if she does 
not please the man who bought her he may allow    
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=228) her to be bought back again . and the author of this 
article says : so my point is this you can take    
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=235) almost any religious text and quote mine it for 
whatever agenda you might have for example    
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=242) you can pick out all the nice stuff disregard the 
other rather obviously not so nice bits and claim    
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=248) it is like no other book and so on . i think the 
point here is that christians generally are not    
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=254) aware of these ghastly verses if they were in the 
quran however and they're not can you imagine how    
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=261) they would be exploited in anti-muslim rhetoric ?
can you imagine they would rub muslims faces in    
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=268) these terrible terrible verses . and yet they're 
in their own bible and they must own them because    
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=273) to traditional christians catholics evangelicals 
this is the word of god and there's nothing like    
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=279) this in the quran nowhere in the quran does it 
say to the prophet that he should target women ,  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=286) children , babies etc . for extermination this is 
something alien to islam but it's there in the    
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=294) sacred texts of the jews and the christians . so 
i hope you didn't find that beginning of that    
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=299) video too shocking . it really is addressed 
to christians who think the worst of the quran    
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=305) when their own bible is actually far more violent 
and extols real nasty atrocities in the    
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=313) way that the quran has never done and islamic 
tradition does not endorse at all and that was    
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/vvMo_Ax195I?t=318) the point of this slightly odd beginning . anyway 
i hope you found it interesting . until next time
