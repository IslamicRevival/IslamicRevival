The video discusses the differences between Paul's Christianity and early Jewish Christianity, which eventually became Islam. It argues that Paul's Christianity did not abolition the law, as Islam does, but rather continued it.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The letter of Peter to James urges James to pass along his sermons carefully, only to those who are worthy to receive them. The clear concern is that Peter's teachings not be corrupted by those who have a different understanding of the truth.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>** The video discusses the difference between what Paul taught and what Peter taught. Peter upholds the teachings of Jesus, which are found in the Gospel of Matthew. Paul teaches that the law has been abolished and replaced with a new humanity. James agrees with Peter and upholds the jewish law.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> i haven't been to a book shop for months but
thankfully i do still get books sent to me from
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7')">0:00:07</a> amazon and this tome arrived today in the post
it's called " After the New Testament : A Reader
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('15')">0:00:15</a> in Early Christianity " 100 to 300 C.E (common era)
A.D by Bart Ehrman . and this is published by Oxford
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('25')">0:00:25</a> university press and i said right it's a little
gem this actually . and it says on the back cover :
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('32')">0:00:32</a> revealing the rich diversity of the early
christian movement . this book brings together
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('37')">0:00:37</a> an extensive collection of texts from the
second and third centuries both orthodox
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('43')">0:00:43</a> and heterodox (in inverted commas) selections
include the writings of the apostolic fathers ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('49')">0:00:49</a> the writings of Nag Hammadi , the early
pseudopigrapha , martyrologies , anti-jewish  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('55')">0:00:55</a> tract dates , hysteriologies , canon list church
orders , liturgical texts and theological treaties .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('62')">0:01:02</a> featuring large textual excerpts , entire documents
wherever possible , concise introductions and lucid
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('69')">0:01:09</a> up-to-date translations . this is ideal for courses
in early christianity , christian origins and early
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('76')">0:01:16</a> church history . and indeed it's got some rave
reviews from academics on the back and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('85')">0:01:25</a> looking through this i just wanted to share with
you some of the letters written by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('91')">0:01:31</a> so-called jewish christians and these are not
people who followed the apostle paul but continued
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('97')">0:01:37</a> to obey the jewish law to all intents and purposes
they were jews who accepted jesus as the messiah ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('102')">0:01:42</a> as a human messiah and as a prophet . one
of the texts is the gospel of the ebionites
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> which i'm not going to read today but because
i want to look at a letter i wasn't really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('115')">0:01:55</a> familiar with it's called " the letter of Peter to
James and its reception " and i'll just read to you
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> what Bart Ehrman has to say about it
and then i'll read a couple of extracts
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('127')">0:02:07</a> from the letter because it's really really
interesting . if you're interested in the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('132')">0:02:12</a> great diversity of doctrine and faith in early
christianities to such a degree that you could
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> even speak of early christianities plural . people
have very very different beliefs about the law ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> about Jesus , about god or even if there was
one god , maybe more there's more than one god
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('148')">0:02:28</a> anyway that's a different subject .
in the letter of Peter to James  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('155')">0:02:35</a> this introduction is by Bart Ehrman he says : the
letter of Peter to James is one of a number of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('159')">0:02:39</a> early christian writings produced in the name of
Jesus disciple Simon Peter . it does not survive
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('167')">0:02:47</a> as an independently a transmitted letter but
only as the preface to the homilies of clement
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('174')">0:02:54</a> a collection of stories and sermons by clement of
Rome . the account of its reception
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('181')">0:03:01</a> by James (that's the brother of Jesus and leader
of the church in Jerusalem) is also part of this
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187')">0:03:07</a> preface . the date of the composition of these works
is difficult to determine but they are probably to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('193')">0:03:13</a> be situated in the early 3rd century . the letter of
Peter urges James to pass along the accompanying
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('201')">0:03:21</a> sermons carefully and only to those who are
worthy to receive them . the clear concern is
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('208')">0:03:28</a> that Peter's teachings not be corrupted by those
who have a different understanding of the truth .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> both the letter and the reception are jewish
christian writings as seen in their emphasis on
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('221')">0:03:41</a> emulating the actions of Moses on keeping the
law and on opposition to the person Peter calls
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('229')">0:03:49</a> the man who is my enemy commonly understood
to be none other than the apostle Paul .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('236')">0:03:56</a> who taught that salvation comes
to all people jew and gentile
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('240')">0:04:00</a> apart from following the law of moses and
who urged gentiles not to be circumcised .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('247')">0:04:07</a> you see in the letter of galatians he talks
about that : Paul's notion stood in sharp contrast
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('253')">0:04:13</a> to the views of jewish christians like
the ebionites as seen here for example
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('258')">0:04:18</a> in the insistence by James the brother of Jesus
himself that only one who has been circumcised is
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('266')">0:04:26</a> a believing christian . so that's Bart Ehrman's
introduction . and the letter of James begins
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> so the letter of Peter to James begins : Peter
to James the lord and bishop of the holy church
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('280')">0:04:40</a> peace be with you always from the
father of all through Jesus christ  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('285')">0:04:45</a> knowing well that you my brother eagerly take
pains about what is for the benefit of us all .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('291')">0:04:51</a> i earnestly beseech you  
not to pass on to anyone of the gentiles
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> the books of my preachings which i
hear forward to you . and of course we
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('304')">0:05:04</a> know in Matthew's gospel that Jesus said
that he was only sent to the lost sheep
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('309')">0:05:09</a> of the house of Israel and Peter here is saying in
effect that he was only sent to preach to the jews .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('317')">0:05:17</a> nor to anyone of our own tribe before probation .
(so even to the jews they have to be tested  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> first) . but if someone worthy of them has been
examined and found to be worthy then you may
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('330')">0:05:30</a> hand over to him in the same way as Moses handed
over his office of a teacher to the seventy . so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338')">0:05:38</a> here is Peter comparing himself with Moses the
jewish prophet . and then skipping to chapter two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('349')">0:05:49</a> the letter of Peter to James says : in order
now that the same may also take place among us
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('357')">0:05:57</a> hand over the books of my preaching in the same
mysterious way to our 70 brethren that they may
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> prepare those who are candidates for positions
as teachers . for if we do not proceed in this way ,
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> our word of truth will be split into many options .
this i do not know as a prophet but i have already  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> the beginning of the evil before
me . for some among the gentiles have rejected my
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> lawful preaching and have preferred a lawless
and absurd doctrine of the man who is my enemy .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('395')">0:06:35</a> so this is Peter talking about Paul referring to
him as the lawless and absurd doctrine of the man
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> who is my enemy . and indeed some have attempted
whilst i am still alive to distort my words  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('410')">0:06:50</a> by interpretations of many sorts as if i taught
the disillusion of the law and although i was of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('417')">0:06:57</a> this opinion did not express it openly but that
may God forbid . so Peter is absolutely rejecting
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> the idea that openly or in a private way that
he rejected the law . now he upheld the law of Moses  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('433')">0:07:13</a> (he says) . and god forbid that i should have preached
anything other than that (he says) . for to do such  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('439')">0:07:19</a> a thing means to act contrary to the law of god
which was made known by Moses and was confirmed by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('446')">0:07:26</a> our lord in in its everlasting continuance . so he's
saying here that Jesus himself taught that the law
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> would continue , the jewish law should be obeyed . for
he said the heaven and the earth will pass away  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('462')">0:07:42</a> but one jot or tittle shall not pass away
from the law . now this is a quote from
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> Matthew 24 to 35 and 5 18. there's two verses
there in Matthew . that's pretty clear so
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('478')">0:07:58</a> ending that there and just reminding ourselves of
what Paul taught in his letter to the ephesians  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('487')">0:08:07</a> Paul says : he Jesus has abolished the law with
its commandments and ordinances so that he might
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('493')">0:08:13</a> create in himself one new humanity in the place
of two thus making peace . so he believes that jesus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('501')">0:08:21</a> taught the abolition of the law even though in
Matthew's gospel chapter 5 verse 17 he says do not
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('507')">0:08:27</a> think i have come to abolish the law . i have not
come to abolish it but to fulfill . so the precise
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> opposite of what Paul is teaching . and in this
letter of Peter to James , Peter is crystal clear
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('519')">0:08:39</a> that he himself upholds that teaching of
Jesus which we see in Matthew's gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('525')">0:08:45</a> and calling Paul who is my enemy . i
think that's probably enough for now , now i just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('535')">0:08:55</a> we ought to say and Bart Ehrman would
doubtless say and i would agree with him
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('540')">0:09:00</a> i don't think this letter is actually
from the historical Peter to James .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('547')">0:09:07</a> for a start people like all of virtually , all
of Jesus disciples what we would perhaps call
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('552')">0:09:12</a> today peasants . they were uneducated and in fact
there's a verse in acts and the sanhedrin actually
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('558')">0:09:18</a> says that they are untutored , they are uneducated
people . they didn't go to galilean university
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> and learn how to read and write , they couldn't
read , they couldn't write , they weren't in a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('569')">0:09:29</a> position to write letters and neither was James .
so i think that this is even though it's not by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('577')">0:09:37</a> Peter nevertheless it does reflect the views
i think of jewish christianity and very likely
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> would be Peter's view as well historically . so
even though it's not by him i think it probably
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('591')">0:09:51</a> faithfully reflects the historical Peter's own
views and definitely reflects the reviews of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('597')">0:09:57</a> James because even in the new testament in acts
it has james clearly upholding the jewish law . so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('605')">0:10:05</a> this is a very different kind of christianity than
you'll hear preached about today in the churches .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('611')">0:10:11</a> it's very different from Paul's christianity
but it bears witness to the great diversity of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('617')">0:10:17</a> christianities we see in the early centuries .
jewish christianity ultimately became extinct  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('624')">0:10:24</a> perhaps to be reborn as islam , as another text i
quoted another video once said : islam in a sense
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('631')">0:10:31</a> carries that same belief about Jesus being
a prophet , a messiah not god and teaching in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('640')">0:10:40</a> the main the continuance of the jewish law
and not teaching its abolition as Paul did .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('645')">0:10:45</a> anyway , i hope that was of
some interest . until next time
