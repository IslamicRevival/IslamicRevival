## Full transcript with timestamps

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=2) now verse 9 of isaiah 42 verse 9 is very 
important because this represents a sort    
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=7) of pivot in the chapter it says behold the 
former things have come to pass in other words    
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=14) what i said in the past came true and now 
i will prophesy again some new things and    
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=21) i will tell them before they happen so now 
the author of deutero isaiah will be speaking    
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=27) explicitly about future events okay so i said that 
usually a prophet speaks to his own generation    
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=35) unless he explicitly states that he's 
going to be speaking to future generations    
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=40) so from verse 10 and to the end of the 
chapter i believe the prophet muhammad    
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=45) is now being described at the primary level 
of the text no longer at the level of midrash    
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=52) he is no longer the mirror image of cyrus now 
he is the image itself and how does it begin  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=63) sing unto the lord a new song a shir in hebrew 
is a lyrical hymn that praises god this is the    
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=71) only appearance of the phrase new song in 
isaiah it does occur in the psalms but the    
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=76) psalms were written by totally different authors 
in a different country separated by hundreds of    
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=80) years so just because another author you know 
used the same two-word phrase in another book    
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=86) of the tanakh does not mean that it's identical 
in meaning the bible as we said is a compendium    
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=92) it's an anthology as you said it's a library 
it has multiple authors and multiple authors    
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=97) often use the same words to mean different 
things so this is going to be a new scripture    
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=101) that praises god a new song unto the lord and 
his praise to hillah from the ends of the earth    
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=110) you who sail to the sea and you the creatures 
in it you islands and coastlands and their    
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=115) inhabitants we already established these yin these 
coast lands verse 11 very important verse o midav  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=128) let the desert and cities lift up their voice  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=134) the cities are sorry the villages 
that kedar inhabits yeshiva    
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=143) the inhabitants of let the inhabitants of selah 
sing for joy let them shout from the tops of the    
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=151) mountains who is kedar so according to genesis 
he is the second son of ishmael peace be upon him    
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=162) imam at tabari he says in his tariq that the 
prophet muhammad peace be upon him is a direct    
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=168) descendant of kedar others as well to be others 
say this as well okay this this is just something    
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=176) mass transmitted as we would say that 
the prophet salallahu is a descendant    
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=180) of ishmael nobody but a crazy revisionist uh 
would dispute this the the ketorites are arabs    
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=188) okay where did they live during the prophet's 
time in the hijaz in the arabian peninsula    
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=194) the quraysh the tribe of the prophet were 
ketorites jessenia says quote the rabbins    
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=201) meaning the rabbis call all the arabians 
universally by this name whence leshon    
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=207) eider is used of the arabic language he's saying 
here that in in hebrew the way to say arabic is  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=216) that's how you say arabic in 
hebrew you say the tongue of kedar    
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=220) okay where is selah according sometimes translate    
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=224) the inhabitants of the rock right according to 
commentaries biblical commentaries selah is petra    
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=232) which was the chief city of the [ __ ] and then 
the nabataeans the nabateens were named after    
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=239) nevayov the firstborn son of ishmael so the 
nabataeans and the ketorites i.e the arabs    
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=248) will lift up their voices and sing for joy when 
this abdullah when this nabil umi will arrive    
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=256) the two major arab capitals of the ancient world 
were petra and mecca the former was the capital of    
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=263) the nabataeans and the latter was the capital 
of the ketorites and incidentally there is a    
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=268) mountain in medina called salah as well there's 
also that which is quite interesting but that's    
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=274) just a little more that's like the cherry on top 
so so we have we have a gentile prophet who will    
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=281) bring true religion the divine religion to the 
coastlands to the nabataeans to the keturites    
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=288) whose character perfectly matches the prophet 
muhammad yet christian apologists act like so what    
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=295) and and then they say that that 
when god told the snake in genesis    
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=300) that the speed of the woman will crush its 
head they say isn't it obvious this is jesus    
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=307) the seed of the woman will will step on a 
snake's head i don't see the obviousness of    
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=312) that at all they further say that by crushing 
the head of the snake jesus destroyed satan    
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=319) and thus sin but he clearly did not from their own 
perspective why because christian polemicists and    
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=327) apologists say that 600 years later satan deceived 
muhammad into thinking he was a prophet of god    
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=334) and by doing so he was able to convince billions 
that jesus was not god not crucified there's no    
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/7zwErHu_xCI?t=341) trinity etc it seems like the snake is 
very much alive from their perspective
