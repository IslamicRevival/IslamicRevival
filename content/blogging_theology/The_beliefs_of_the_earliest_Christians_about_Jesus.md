The earliest Christians believed that Jesus was a great prophet of God and a messiah, and that he was born of the virgin Mary without involvement of Joseph. This belief was later rejected by mainstream Christianity.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The Ebionites were a Jewish Christian sect that believed in Jesus as a prophet but did not believe in the virgin birth. This sect was eventually rejected by mainstream Christianity.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">0:00:00</a> i just wanted to make a brief video in response 
to some claims by prominent christian apologists    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7')">0:00:07</a> and polemicists online that the early jewish 
christian sects the ebionites as they're called uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('16')">0:00:16</a> did not believe in the virgin birth 
now why does this matter because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('20')">0:00:20</a> the early the earliest christians were jewish 
christians and they had beliefs about jesus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('26')">0:00:26</a> and about the jewish law and so on which are 
quite different from later christian orthodoxy    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('32')">0:00:32</a> certainly different from paul's ideas which became 
dominant in the second century onwards up to today    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('39')">0:00:39</a> and the accusation is that the ebionites as 
they're called these jewish christians did not    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('44')">0:00:44</a> believe in the virgin birth so their faith was 
suspect they were heretics anyway so why are we    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('51')">0:00:51</a> putting so much store by what they believe they 
didn't quite get their beliefs right now this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('56')">0:00:56</a> is a half truth at best and i want to show why 
uh this is a half-truth uh by referring to the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('63')">0:01:03</a> uh well-known book by eusebius the history of the 
church who is eusebius on the back cover it says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('71')">0:01:11</a> eusebius's account is the only surviving 
historical account of the church during    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('76')">0:01:16</a> its crucial first 300 years bishop eusebius 
who was born in ad260 so it's really early    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('84')">0:01:24</a> a learned scholar who lived most of his life 
in caesarea in palestine broke new ground in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('90')">0:01:30</a> writing the history and provided a model for all 
later ecclesiastical historians church historians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('97')">0:01:37</a> so uh this book by the way is edited by uh andrew 
luth who's a professor of patristic studies    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('104')">0:01:44</a> at the university of durham and at the very back 
he has a glossary of the who's who of eusebius and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('111')">0:01:51</a> he helpfully tells us about the ebionites the word 
is derived from a hebrew word meaning the poor    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('118')">0:01:58</a> this may indicate that the original ebionites were 
materially poor or that they thought of themselves    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('125')">0:02:05</a> as the poor ones who depend utterly on the grace 
of god and then he goes on they seem to have been    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('132')">0:02:12</a> jewish christians who respected christ but 
could not conceive of his relationship to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('138')">0:02:18</a> god as anything other than that of a man 
inspired by god like one of the prophets    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> eusebius is scornful of jewish christianity this 
is the original faith of the disciples by the way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('151')">0:02:31</a> and knows little about it anyway obviously it 
seems to have been much more important in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('156')">0:02:36</a> early centuries of christianity than appears 
from the history of the church end quote    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> now we know there's some for much much scholarship 
in the last 40 50 years that the original    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('167')">0:02:47</a> disciples and followers of those 
people like james the brother of jesus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> were jewish christians who believe very different 
things than paul believed in the emerging    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('176')">0:02:56</a> great church in the second century the 
catholic church and evangelicals today    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('181')">0:03:01</a> so the point is what why is this matter what 
they believed about the virgin birth because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('186')">0:03:06</a> if it can be shown they didn't believe in the 
virgin birth that discredits them in the eyes of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('191')">0:03:11</a> many people look muslims believe he he was born of 
a virgin the gospels say he was born of a virgin    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> these people were just heretics why should we take 
what they say seriously so this is i think the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203')">0:03:23</a> the agenda behind some uh quite well very well 
known christian apologists who i will not name    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('208')">0:03:28</a> because i don't want to get into a tit for tat ad 
hominem with people so what does eusebius tell us    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('216')">0:03:36</a> well he tells us something very interesting 
uh and on page 90 of this book this is the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223')">0:03:43</a> uh the third chapter of eusebius he 
writes this there are two ebionite sects    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('231')">0:03:51</a> the first one um says they regard him as him jesus 
as plain and ordinary a man esteemed as righteous    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('241')">0:04:01</a> through growth of character and nothing more the 
child of a normal union between a man and mary    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('248')">0:04:08</a> and they held that that they must observe every 
detail of the law these are jews basically who    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('255')">0:04:15</a> believe in jesus as the messiah as the prophet 
but they believe that he was not born of a virgin    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('261')">0:04:21</a> and then you see this goes on a second group went 
by the same name ebia ebionites but escapes the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> outrageous absurdity of the first they did 
not deny that the lord was born of a virgin    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> and the holy spirit but nevertheless shared 
their refusal to acknowledge his pre-existence    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('280')">0:04:40</a> as god the word and wisdom thus the impious 
doctrine of the others was their undoing also    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> especially as they placed equal emphasis 
on the outward observance of the law    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> they held that the epistles of the apostle 
that means paul of course ought to be rejected    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('297')">0:04:57</a> all together calling him a renegade from the 
law and using only the gospel of the hebrews    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('305')">0:05:05</a> they treated the the rest with scant respect like 
the others they observe the sabbath and the whole    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312')">0:05:12</a> jewish system so he is very scathing of these 
people but of course they represent the original    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> uh faith of the disciples who are torah 
observant jews we can see this in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> book of acts it's it states they were and we 
can see uh also that this second group of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('328')">0:05:28</a> ebonites believed in the virgin birth so there 
seemed to be split between them and i'm not sure    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('334')">0:05:34</a> how they split and did they co-mingle or were 
they separate denominations but clearly there    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('340')">0:05:40</a> was a group of ebionites who did believe in the 
virgin birth who were jewish christians and some    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('346')">0:05:46</a> who didn't believe in the virgin birth so this 
story that the ebio knights didn't believe in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('351')">0:05:51</a> virgin mary in the virgin birth is wrong it's a 
half-truth uh some were quite orthodox by islamic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('358')">0:05:58</a> standards shall we say that they believed that 
jesus was born of the virgin mary without any    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('364')">0:06:04</a> involvement of joseph but also they observe the 
law uh observe they view jesus as just a man a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> great prophet of god a messiah which of course is 
exactly what the quran teaches as well so that's a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> an amazing coincidence you may say so um i just 
wanted to uh just touch on this point because it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('386')">0:06:26</a> used against uh to discredit the jewish christians 
this whole thing of the virgin birth and um it's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('392')">0:06:32</a> a distortion of the facts and i just want to get 
that on record for what it's worth till next time
