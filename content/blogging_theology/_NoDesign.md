This video discusses how trees are able to transport water to their topmost branches using xylem tubes. Xylem tubes are filled with water and do not contain air bubbles, which allows water to remain in the metastable liquid state. Trees use five percent of the water in photosynthesis, and the other 95 percent evaporates.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDLUiVhY7w&t=0)** The video features the physicist Dr. Derek Muller explaining how trees are able to transport water up to their topmost branches, despite the fact that the pressure at the top is so negative. Trees use additional pressure to suck water into the tree and then transfer it to the xylem tubes, which are too wide at 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDLUiVhY7w&t=300)** The video discusses the importance of xylem tubes in trees, which are filled with water from the start and do not contain air bubbles. This allows water to remain in the metastable liquid state, which is important for photosynthesis. Trees use five percent of the water in photosynthesis, and the other 95 percent evaporates. This video will change how viewers view trees.

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=1) I love doing the no design posts the subjectÂ 
is virtually inexhaustible and infinite  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=14) God's design in creation is everywhere we lookÂ 
from the Apparently simple flower to complex DNAÂ Â   
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=22) we see evidence of design in the universe it's notÂ 
just the irreducibly complex molecular machines orÂ Â   
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=31) how the laws of physics unexpectedly conspireÂ 
in an extraordinary way to make the universeÂ Â   
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=38) habitable for life thanks to science we can nowÂ 
see design in unappreciated living things allÂ Â   
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=47) around us I want to share with you a fascinatingÂ 
video explaining how trees do the impossibleÂ Â   
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=57) it features the physicist Dr Derek Muller whoÂ 
is a specialist in explaining science to theÂ Â   
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=63) General Public after watching this I promise youÂ 
will never look at trees the same way again enjoyÂ Â   
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=74) sometimes the simplest questions have the mostÂ 
amazing answers like how can trees be so tallÂ Â   
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=80) it's a question that doesn't even seem like itÂ 
needs an answer trees just are tall some of themÂ Â   
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=86) are over 100 meters why should there be a heightÂ 
limit I'll tell you why trees need to transportÂ Â   
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=92) water from their Roots up until their topmostÂ 
branches in order to survive and that is noÂ Â   
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=96) trivial task there is a limit to the height thatÂ 
water can be sucked up a tube it's 10 meters ifÂ Â   
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=102) you suck on a long vertical straw the water willÂ 
go no higher than 10 meters at this point thereÂ Â   
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=108) will be a perfect vacuum at the top of the strawÂ 
and the water will start to boil spontaneouslyÂ Â   
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=113) for a tree to raise water 100 meters it wouldÂ 
have to create a pressure difference of 10Â Â   
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=117) atmospheres how would trees do that when I posedÂ 
this conundrum a lot of people said the answer isÂ Â   
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=124) transpiration and that's when water evaporatesÂ 
from the leaf pulling up the water moleculesÂ Â   
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=129) behind it now that's clearly a mechanism a treeÂ 
can use to create suction but it doesn't helpÂ Â   
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=134) us overcome this 10 meter limit the lowest theÂ 
pressure can go is the pure vacuum which I imagineÂ Â   
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=138) is not happening inside of tree leaves rightÂ 
right Hank so you might suspect that a tree doesÂ Â   
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=145) not contain continuous straw-like tubes the treeÂ 
effectively has valves in it so you don't have aÂ Â   
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=152) column of water this big tube which you're sayingÂ 
needs to be filled with water is actually made upÂ Â   
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=157) of cells although these are good speculations theyÂ 
don't turn out to be correct scientists who studyÂ Â   
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=162) trees find that the xylem tubes that transportÂ 
water do contain a continuous water column soÂ Â   
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=168) how else could the tree transport water from theÂ 
roots to the leaves they don't suck they don't useÂ Â   
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=172) a vacuum oh okay so how do they do it pleasingÂ 
like a cow like you're squeezing the cowlitterÂ Â   
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=177) all the way up there's little tree muscles inÂ 
there yeah besides being a giant waste of energyÂ Â   
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=182) all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes areÂ 
dead what about osmotic pressure If there is moreÂ Â   
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=188) solute in The Roots than in the surrounding soilÂ 
water would be pushed up the tree but some treesÂ Â   
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=193) live in mangroves where the water is so saltyÂ 
that osmotic pressure actually acts in the otherÂ Â   
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=198) direction so the tree needs additional pressure toÂ 
suck water into the tree then it must be capillaryÂ Â   
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=203) action the thinner the tube the higher the waterÂ 
can climb but the tubes in a tree are too wide atÂ Â   
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=210) 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter water shouldÂ 
rise less than a meter so how do trees do itÂ Â   
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=216) well one of the assumptions we made is wrong theÂ 
lowest the pressure can go is the pure vacuum pureÂ Â   
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=222) vacuum your vacuum in a gas this is true when youÂ 
eliminate all of the gas molecules the pressure isÂ Â   
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=227) zero and you have a perfect vacuum but in a liquidÂ 
you can go lower than zero pressure and actuallyÂ Â   
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=234) get Negative pressures in a solid we would thinkÂ 
of this as tension this means that the moleculesÂ Â   
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=239) are pulling on each other and their surroundingsÂ 
as the water evaporates from the pores of the cellÂ Â   
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=245) wall they create immense negative pressures ofÂ 
-15 atmospheres in an average tree think aboutÂ Â   
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=252) the air water interface at the pore there is oneÂ 
atmosphere of pressure pushing in and negative 15Â Â   
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=258) atmospheres of suction on the other side so whyÂ 
doesn't the meniscus break because the pores areÂ Â   
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=264) tiny only two to five nanometers in diameterÂ 
at this scale water's high surface tensionÂ Â   
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=270) ensures the air water boundary can withstand hugeÂ 
pressures without caving As you move down the treeÂ Â   
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=277) the pressure increases up to atmospheric at theÂ 
roots so you can have a large pressure differenceÂ Â   
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=282) between the top and the bottom of the tree becauseÂ 
the pressure at the top is so negative but hangÂ Â   
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=287) on if the pressure at the top is negative 15Â 
atmospheres shouldn't the water be boilingÂ Â   
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=292) yes yes it should but changing phase from liquidÂ 
to gas requires activation energy and that canÂ Â   
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=300) come in the form of a nucleation site like a tinyÂ 
air bubble that's why it's so important that theÂ Â   
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=304) xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and they canÂ 
do this because unlike a straw they've been waterÂ Â   
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=310) filled from the start this way water remainsÂ 
in the metastable liquid state when it reallyÂ Â   
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=315) should be boiling it's just like supercooledÂ 
water remains liquid even though it should beÂ Â   
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=320) ice so you could say that the water in a treeÂ 
is super sucked because it remains liquid atÂ Â   
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=325) such negative pressures and why are trees movingÂ 
all this water up the tree I want you to make aÂ Â   
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=331) guess say it out loud for photosynthesis actuallyÂ 
no less than one percent of the water is used inÂ Â   
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=337) photosynthetic reactions any other ideas okay whatÂ 
about growth well five percent of the water isÂ Â   
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=343) used to make new cells well so what happens to theÂ 
other 95 percent of the water it just evaporatesÂ Â   
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=350) for each molecule of carbon dioxide a tree takesÂ 
in it loses hundreds of molecules of water whoaÂ Â   
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=356) can you believe how amazing this is trees createÂ 
huge negative pressures of tens of atmospheres byÂ Â   
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=363) evaporating water through nanoscale pores suckingÂ 
water up 100 meters in a state where it shouldÂ Â   
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=368) be boiling but can't because the perfectÂ 
xylem tubes contain no air bubbles just soÂ Â   
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=372) that most of it can evaporate in the process ofÂ 
absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxideÂ Â   
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/UGDLUiVhY7w?t=379) I will never look at trees the same way again
