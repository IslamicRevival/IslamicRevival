This video discusses how trees are able to transport water to their topmost branches using xylem tubes. Xylem tubes are filled with water and do not contain air bubbles, which allows water to remain in the metastable liquid state. Trees use five percent of the water in photosynthesis, and the other 95 percent evaporates.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The video features the physicist Dr. Derek Muller explaining how trees are able to transport water up to their topmost branches, despite the fact that the pressure at the top is so negative. Trees use additional pressure to suck water into the tree and then transfer it to the xylem tubes, which are too wide at 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter.

*   **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>** The video discusses the importance of xylem tubes in trees, which are filled with water from the start and do not contain air bubbles. This allows water to remain in the metastable liquid state, which is important for photosynthesis. Trees use five percent of the water in photosynthesis, and the other 95 percent evaporates. This video will change how viewers view trees.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> I love doing the no design posts the subject
is virtually inexhaustible and infinite\ <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('14')">0:00:14</a> God's design in creation is everywhere we look
from the Apparently simple flower to complex DNA <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('22')">0:00:22</a> we see evidence of design in the universe it's not
just the irreducibly complex molecular machines or <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('31')">0:00:31</a> how the laws of physics unexpectedly conspire
in an extraordinary way to make the universe <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('38')">0:00:38</a> habitable for life thanks to science we can now
see design in unappreciated living things all <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('47')">0:00:47</a> around us I want to share with you a fascinating
video explaining how trees do the impossible <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('57')">0:00:57</a> it features the physicist Dr Derek Muller who
is a specialist in explaining science to the <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('63')">0:01:03</a> General Public after watching this I promise you
will never look at trees the same way again enjoy <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('74')">0:01:14</a> sometimes the simplest questions have the most
amazing answers like how can trees be so tall <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('80')">0:01:20</a> it's a question that doesn't even seem like it
needs an answer trees just are tall some of them <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('86')">0:01:26</a> are over 100 meters why should there be a height
limit I'll tell you why trees need to transport <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('92')">0:01:32</a> water from their Roots up until their topmost
branches in order to survive and that is no <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('96')">0:01:36</a> trivial task there is a limit to the height that
water can be sucked up a tube it's 10 meters if <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('102')">0:01:42</a> you suck on a long vertical straw the water will
go no higher than 10 meters at this point there <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('108')">0:01:48</a> will be a perfect vacuum at the top of the straw
and the water will start to boil spontaneously <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> for a tree to raise water 100 meters it would
have to create a pressure difference of 10 <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('117')">0:01:57</a> atmospheres how would trees do that when I posed
this conundrum a lot of people said the answer is <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('124')">0:02:04</a> transpiration and that's when water evaporates
from the leaf pulling up the water molecules <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('129')">0:02:09</a> behind it now that's clearly a mechanism a tree
can use to create suction but it doesn't help <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('134')">0:02:14</a> us overcome this 10 meter limit the lowest the
pressure can go is the pure vacuum which I imagine <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('138')">0:02:18</a> is not happening inside of tree leaves right
right Hank so you might suspect that a tree does <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('145')">0:02:25</a> not contain continuous straw-like tubes the tree
effectively has valves in it so you don't have a <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('152')">0:02:32</a> column of water this big tube which you're saying
needs to be filled with water is actually made up <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> of cells although these are good speculations they
don't turn out to be correct scientists who study <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> trees find that the xylem tubes that transport
water do contain a continuous water column so <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('168')">0:02:48</a> how else could the tree transport water from the
roots to the leaves they don't suck they don't use <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> a vacuum oh okay so how do they do it pleasing
like a cow like you're squeezing the cowlitter <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('177')">0:02:57</a> all the way up there's little tree muscles in
there yeah besides being a giant waste of energy <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('182')">0:03:02</a> all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes are
dead what about osmotic pressure If there is more <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('188')">0:03:08</a> solute in The Roots than in the surrounding soil
water would be pushed up the tree but some trees <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('193')">0:03:13</a> live in mangroves where the water is so salty
that osmotic pressure actually acts in the other <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> direction so the tree needs additional pressure to
suck water into the tree then it must be capillary <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203')">0:03:23</a> action the thinner the tube the higher the water
can climb but the tubes in a tree are too wide at <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('210')">0:03:30</a> 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter water should
rise less than a meter so how do trees do it <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('216')">0:03:36</a> well one of the assumptions we made is wrong the
lowest the pressure can go is the pure vacuum pure <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('222')">0:03:42</a> vacuum your vacuum in a gas this is true when you
eliminate all of the gas molecules the pressure is <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('227')">0:03:47</a> zero and you have a perfect vacuum but in a liquid
you can go lower than zero pressure and actually <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234')">0:03:54</a> get Negative pressures in a solid we would think
of this as tension this means that the molecules <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('239')">0:03:59</a> are pulling on each other and their surroundings
as the water evaporates from the pores of the cell <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('245')">0:04:05</a> wall they create immense negative pressures of
-15 atmospheres in an average tree think about <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('252')">0:04:12</a> the air water interface at the pore there is one
atmosphere of pressure pushing in and negative 15 <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('258')">0:04:18</a> atmospheres of suction on the other side so why
doesn't the meniscus break because the pores are <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('264')">0:04:24</a> tiny only two to five nanometers in diameter
at this scale water's high surface tension <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('270')">0:04:30</a> ensures the air water boundary can withstand huge
pressures without caving As you move down the tree <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('277')">0:04:37</a> the pressure increases up to atmospheric at the
roots so you can have a large pressure difference <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> between the top and the bottom of the tree because
the pressure at the top is so negative but hang <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> on if the pressure at the top is negative 15
atmospheres shouldn't the water be boiling <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> yes yes it should but changing phase from liquid
to gas requires activation energy and that can <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">0:05:00</a> come in the form of a nucleation site like a tiny
air bubble that's why it's so important that the <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('304')">0:05:04</a> xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and they can
do this because unlike a straw they've been water <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> filled from the start this way water remains
in the metastable liquid state when it really <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('315')">0:05:15</a> should be boiling it's just like supercooled
water remains liquid even though it should be <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('320')">0:05:20</a> ice so you could say that the water in a tree
is super sucked because it remains liquid at <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('325')">0:05:25</a> such negative pressures and why are trees moving
all this water up the tree I want you to make a <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('331')">0:05:31</a> guess say it out loud for photosynthesis actually
no less than one percent of the water is used in <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('337')">0:05:37</a> photosynthetic reactions any other ideas okay what
about growth well five percent of the water is <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> used to make new cells well so what happens to the
other 95 percent of the water it just evaporates <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('350')">0:05:50</a> for each molecule of carbon dioxide a tree takes
in it loses hundreds of molecules of water whoa <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('356')">0:05:56</a> can you believe how amazing this is trees create
huge negative pressures of tens of atmospheres by <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> evaporating water through nanoscale pores sucking
water up 100 meters in a state where it should <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368')">0:06:08</a> be boiling but can't because the perfect
xylem tubes contain no air bubbles just so <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('372')">0:06:12</a> that most of it can evaporate in the process of
absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> I will never look at trees the same way again
