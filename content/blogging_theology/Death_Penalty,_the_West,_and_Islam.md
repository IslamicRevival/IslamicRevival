 Prince Ghazi discusses the hypocrisy of the West when it comes to the death penalty in the Middle East. He argues that while global NGOs do good things, they are biased in their criticisms of the Islamic world and are used as political tools by various western countries. Prince Ghazi also argues that the death penalty should be imposed for certain kinds of murder, and that Muslims in the Middle East see the death penalty in a similar way to how Christians in the West see punishment for murder. He concludes by noting that Islamic NGOs have somewhat lost their status because of the extremism of some of them, but that they remain popular because of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings on justice and charity.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l-ASSaAPS4&t=0)** Prince Ghazi's book "A Thinking Person's Guide to our Times" discusses the hypocrisy and moral superiority of the West regarding the death penalty in the Middle East. Prince Ghazi argues that while global NGOs like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Médecins Sans Frontières clearly do good things, they remain biased in their criticisms of the Islamic world and are used as political tools by various western countries to beat muslim countries over the head. Prince Ghazi also argues that the death penalty should be imposed for certain kinds of murder corroborated by certain sufficient kinds of evidence, and that Muslims in the Middle East see the death penalty in a similar way to how Christians in the West see punishment for murder. Prince Ghazi concludes by noting that Islamic NGOs have somewhat lost their status because of the extremism of some of them, but that they remain popular because of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings on justice and charity.

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=1) Prince Ghazi's book 'A Thinking Person's 
Guide to our Times' is full of    
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=6) penetrating insights and analyses of the West 
and the Middle East and the hypocrisy and moral    
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=12) superiorities that ooze out of every pour 
of western attitudes towards the Middle East.    
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=18) There's a great one here concerning the death 
penalty which i'd like to share with you it's on    
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=23) a section called NGOs. NGOs means non-governmental 
organizations and he writes on page 93 'Whilst    
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=32) global NGOs like Amnesty International, Human 
Rights Watch and Médecins Sans Frontières clearly    
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=39) do and say some good things they remain lopsided 
in their criticisms of the Islamic world and are    
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=46) clearly used as political tools by various western 
countries to beat muslim countries over the head    
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=54) they also try to impose often arbitrary 
western values and cultural prejudices    
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=60) all the while pretending they are universal 
human values. For example, most people in the    
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=67) Middle East think of the death penalty should be 
imposed for certain kinds of murder corroborated    
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=73) by certain sufficient kinds of evidence indeed 
i have personally seen in a tribal context how    
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=81) when a state does not execute convicted murderers 
it leads to blood feuds that carry on for decades    
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=89) and claim dozens of innocent lives and uproot 
entire clans. God says in the Qur'an: 'In retaliation    
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=98) there is life for you, O people of reason, so that 
you might fear God.' That's Surah Al-Baqarah 2:179.    
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=108) Thus most people in the Middle East do not see why 
Amnesty International or others should come tell    
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=114) them how to run their societies as if they enjoy 
some kind of moral superiority there are millions    
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=122) of abortions a year in the US and one-third 
of pregnancies in Europe and in abortion    
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=129) how can the west be more concerned about the 
judicial execution of a few guilty murderers    
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=136) than the extrajudicial genocide of their own 
children whose only crime is to be inconvenient    
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=145) anyone who has any doubts about the issue of 
abortion should watch one or at least inform    
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=151) themselves of what it involves scientifically it 
involves biting into a sentient often conscious    
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=158) tiny human being with a steel clamp who is then 
literally ripped out of the womb limb by limb    
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=165) whilst initially still alive first the legs then 
the torso the arms and then the head and dying    
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=173) that way and then being thrown with toxic waste 
thrown away all whilst the mother sleeps islamic    
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=181) ngos have also somewhat lost their status not 
merely because some of them have funded extremism    
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=188) but also because post 9-11 donating money to 
an Islamic NGO is liable to cause problems    
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=196) for the donor no matter how innocent the donor 
or worthy the cause today every international    
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/6l-ASSaAPS4?t=204) islamic charitable financial transaction 
is tracked and hounded like a fox. Till next time.
