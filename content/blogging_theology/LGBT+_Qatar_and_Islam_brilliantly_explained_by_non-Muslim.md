[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=3) I came across a video on Tick Tock recently 
which has really impressed a lot of people    
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=9) especially Muslims you get this guy who's 
a non-muslim and giving us telling the world    
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=15) the real reason behind why Qatar is having so 
much trouble accepting LGBT people and that's    
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=24) precisely the wording this guy Dennis Fang uses  on Tick Tock as I say I just want to share this    
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=31) video it's quite short a couple of minutes long 
and it's one of the best videos I've ever come    
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=37) across by a non-Muslim explaining the Islamic 
perspective on LGBT and gender and why Qatar as    
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=45) he puts it is having so much trouble from the 
West which accepts a very different set of values    
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=50) based on secular liberalism and of course the 
West is seeking to impose this culturally and    
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=57) economically on the rest of the world and Qatar 
obviously as a Muslim country is resisting this    
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=63) and the West doesn't understand why he doesn't 
want to hear the reasons why and Dennis Fang    
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=69) to his credit, he sounds like an English educated 
public school guy, actually I think he lives in    
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=75) Australia but gives a superb set of insightful 
reasons why Muslims do not accept this agenda    
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=82) why actually we cannot accept this agenda it's 
not a question of stubbornness or not wanting to    
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=87) go along with the Western values that God has 
given us certain parameters and guidelines and    
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=93) rules uh by which to live our lives and they are 
non-negotiable they are set down by our creator    
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=101) anyway I'll I want to share this 
video I'll share it with you its entirety    
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=105) and I'll link to the tick tock  link 
below and you can read the comments left by    
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=112) Muslims which are very appreciative 
of their non-Muslims understanding which I    
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=119) think is quite rare in my experience to find 
a non Muslin to really get it anyway enjoy.  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=119) why is Qatar struggling so much with LGBT people is 
a simple bigotry can't they be more open-minded    
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=133) or be more accepting of all self-identities well 
it's because of the moral framework of Islam and    
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=139) LGBT that are diametrically opposed you see LGBT 
is a result of Western individual liberalism it's    
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=146) built a fundamentally upon the Revolutionary idea 
that one has sovereignty over their own bodies    
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=153) you are free to do whatever you want with it as it 
resolves the idea of goodness is a utilitarian one    
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=159) where fostering one's own pleasure and limiting 
the undermining of other people's pleasure is    
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=165) the ultimate virtue and because morality is 
subjective one's own feelings inside are of    
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=171) the utmost importance hence we have people 
identifying with our own feelings and bodily    
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=177) urges hence I feel like a female therefore I am a 
female I'm attracted to men therefore I identify    
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=183) suffice a homosexual in Islam on the other 
hand one doesn't have sovereignty over their    
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=188) own bodies for humans were created deliberately 
by God to fulfill a noble and spiritual purpose    
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=195) and that purpose is in serving God who is the 
ultimate form of good in this moral framework    
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=202) in this Paradigm Allah created the male and 
the female with reproductive and social roles    
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=208) and thus fulfilling those purposes it's honoring 
God there is no concept of my body my choice for    
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=214) the choice has already been made it was destined 
for you it is for example only in a heterosexual    
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=220) marriage where gender differences are in force 
when men are more dominant and women have ideals    
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=226) of beauty and gentility that we see a metaphysical 
wholeness in marriage sex outside those purposes    
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=234) loses all meaning and legitimacy for remember the 
purpose of sex isn't individualistic pleasure but    
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=241) to fulfill a higher and trans Transcendent good I 
hope you can see that guitar can't simply make a    
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=248) few small amendments to their laws and wave 
a rainbow flag and accept homosexuality and    
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=253) trans people because they're whole teleology of 
humanity in general is diametrically opposed to    
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=260) what we're familiar with in the western world and 
all the individualistic liberalism has become the    
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=267) de facto lingua Franca of morality we do need to 
understand the difficulty or even the futility of    
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=274) well colonizing foreign people without ideas 
morality we might think that we're right and    
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/0RLpcXt7M2g?t=280) they're wrong but remember they are thinking 
the exact same thing thanks for watching
