 discusses how the Bible and the Quran portray the Blessed Virgin Mary differently. While the Bible presents different portraits of Mary depending on the gospel, the Quran generally agrees with Luke's gospel. However, the Quran criticizes Christians for treating Mary as a divinity.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>**  scholar Matt Dillahunty looks at the portrayal of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Bible and the Qur'an. He finds that while the Bible and Qur'an depict Mary in different ways, there is a general consensus that these texts were written by different authors who drew on earlier sources. In Matthew's gospel, for example, the negative portrayal of Mary's brothers is eliminated, while Luke presents a highly positive portrait of Mary. Catholics often turn to Luke's gospel for devotions related to Mary's narrative.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>* Discusses how the gospel writers portray Mary, and how this differs depending on which gospel is being studied. It mentions that the quran agrees with Luke's portrayal of Mary, but disagrees with Mark's negative portrait. It suggests that Muslims should use the quran to navigate the way through the gospels, as the quran agrees with Luke's portrayal of Mary more than it does with Mark's.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>** The Quran criticizes Christians for treating Mary as a divinity. It asserts that prayer is directed to her petitions, and that she is called the queen of heaven and mother of god.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> in this video i want to look at the blessed virgin 
mary in the bible and quran from a slightly more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8')">0:00:08</a> academic uh perspective on a first reading of the 
gospels matthew mark luke and john it's tempting    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('16')">0:00:16</a> to take these stories at face value here are 
ancient texts that tell us what mary the mother    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('22')">0:00:22</a> of jesus said and did the historical reliability 
is usually assumed without question and this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('29')">0:00:29</a> way of reading the gospels has been the norm in 
christian churches for the past two thousand years    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('35')">0:00:35</a> these days however such a reading of the gospels 
is no longer possible as we have seen in previous    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('41')">0:00:41</a> videos there are four gospels matthew mark luke 
and john and each has a different picture of jesus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('47')">0:00:47</a> and his teaching it's illuminating to apply the 
same methodology to the gospel portraits of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('53')">0:00:53</a> virgin mary that we have seen employed with such 
powerful effect concerning the gospel portraits    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('59')">0:00:59</a> of jesus so i want to examine how the gospel 
writers depict mary the mother of jesus and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('64')">0:01:04</a> then i'm going to go on to the quran the earliest 
surviving gospel that of mark portrays mary along    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('72')">0:01:12</a> with jesus brothers in a negative light placing 
them literally outside the circle of those who    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('80')">0:01:20</a> make up his family which is based on faith if you 
look at mark chapter 3 verses 20 onwards it says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('88')">0:01:28</a> and the crowd came together again so that they 
could not even eat when his family heard it they    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('94')">0:01:34</a> went out to restrain him for people were saying he 
has gone out of his mind and the scribes came down    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('100')">0:01:40</a> from jerusalem said he has beelzebub as a demon 
and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> and jesus called them to him and said and spoke 
to them in parables how come satan cast out satan    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('115')">0:01:55</a> if a kingdom is divided against itself that 
kingdom cannot stand and if a house is divided    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> against itself that house will not be able 
to stand and if satan has risen up against    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> himself and is divided he cannot stand but his end 
has come but no one can enter a strong man's house    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('136')">0:02:16</a> and plunder his property without first tying 
up the strong man then indeed the house can be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('142')">0:02:22</a> plundered truly i tell you people will be forgiven 
for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('149')">0:02:29</a> but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit can 
never be forgiven but is guilty of an eternal sin    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> for they have said he has an unclean spirit then 
his mother and his brothers came and standing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('165')">0:02:45</a> outside they sent sent to him and called him a 
crowd was sitting around him and they said to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> him your mother and your brothers and sisters are 
outside asking for you and jesus replied who are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> my mother and my brothers and looking at those 
who sat around him he said here are my mother    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> and my brothers whoever does the will of god 
is my brother and sister and mother end quote    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('193')">0:03:13</a> the scholarly consensus is that mark was the first 
to be written matthew and luke then used markers    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('199')">0:03:19</a> as source as well as a hypothetical saying source 
known as q q is the first letter of the german    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('205')">0:03:25</a> word quell meaning source i think this is the 
most plausible explanation although a few scholars    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('211')">0:03:31</a> still disagree so matthew relies on mark as 
one of his sources but he clearly thought    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('218')">0:03:38</a> mark was inadequate and complete because 
sometimes matthew paraphrases mark sometimes    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('224')">0:03:44</a> he deliberately alters mark and this shows us 
that for mark so for matthew the facts could be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('231')">0:03:51</a> changed to enhance his message a good example 
of this change is to note how matthew improves    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('238')">0:03:58</a> the negative portrayal of jesus mother and 
brothers in mark in the latter in mark they    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('244')">0:04:04</a> are shown as outsiders who think jesus is mad and 
they repeatedly fail to understand jesus message    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('253')">0:04:13</a> matthew however has a very different positive 
picture perhaps wanting to show the disciples    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('259')">0:04:19</a> as good role models for christians he is happy 
to change mark's narrative to fit his viewpoint    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('266')">0:04:26</a> he omits mark's negative story where mary and the 
brothers all try to restrain jesus because they    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('273')">0:04:33</a> thought he was out of his mind so it is clear 
that there has been some development in the way    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('280')">0:04:40</a> mary is portrayed in the gospels in matthew's 
gospel mark's negative betrayal is eliminated    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('288')">0:04:48</a> luke unlike mark also presents a highly positive 
portrait of mary and this is the gospel that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('294')">0:04:54</a> catholics often go to for their devotions and 
understanding when they're praying the rosary    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('298')">0:04:58</a> for example it's luke's picture of a narrative of 
mary that they focus and reflect on in the scene    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('306')">0:05:06</a> parallel to marx with the brothers in the house 
she is now included in the eschatological family    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('313')">0:05:13</a> those who hear the word of god and do it just 
look up luke chapter 8 verse 19 20 and 21    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('320')">0:05:20</a> luke like matthew omits the embarrassing and 
offensive passage in mark chapter 3 verse 20 21    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('328')">0:05:28</a> in a groundbreaking ecumenical study a team of 
roman catholic anglican and protestant scholars    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('335')">0:05:35</a> collaborated in producing this agreed statement on 
mary's called mary in the new testament edited by    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('342')">0:05:42</a> some quite famous names if you know new testament 
studies raymond brown joseph fitzmeyer and others    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('348')">0:05:48</a> and this was published uh some years ago but 
i want to share with you their conclusions so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('354')">0:05:54</a> this is quite unusual it has a roman catholic and 
protestant and anglican agreed statement on mary    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('360')">0:06:00</a> historically these churches have been literally at 
war with each other but now they can come together    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('365')">0:06:05</a> and produce this agreed consensus on the new 
testament's portrait of mary and they say in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('373')">0:06:13</a> matthew's form of the passage in mark which we've 
seen is not that different from marx they say    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('381')">0:06:21</a> however it is not so much in the passage itself 
that matthew differs from mark but in the context    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('388')">0:06:28</a> the introductory scene in mark chapter 3 verse 
2021 in which his own think he is beside himself    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('396')">0:06:36</a> out of his mind is completely absent 
presumably they say the omission was deliberate    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> and it can be understood if matthew interpreted 
marx his own to include jesus mother that's page    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('411')">0:06:51</a> 99 of the book the study concludes with 
this assessment of the synoptic gospels    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('417')">0:06:57</a> depiction of mary in other words how matthew 
mark and luke portray mary the mother of jesus    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('423')">0:07:03</a> we have spoken of a negative portrait of 
mary in the gospel of mark the principal    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('429')">0:07:09</a> text text which leads to that conclusion is 
mark 3 20-35 in matthew and luke's parallels    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('439')">0:07:19</a> to mark they give a rather different picture 
largely by modification of the mark and text    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('446')">0:07:26</a> both evangelists dropped the harsh introduction 
in mark 3 20-21 luke goes further in softening    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> the marking picture by eliminating also the 
question of jesus who are my mother and brothers    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> and by transferring the beelzebub controversy 
to another place entirely in luke chapter 11.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> thus in the synoptic depiction of mary during 
jesus ministry we have a development from the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> negative estimation of mark to the positive one 
of luke with matthew representing the middle term    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> that's page 286 of this book so just to conclude 
the that kind of academic uh scholarly appraisal    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('492')">0:08:12</a> of the subject what are we to make then of 
the truth about mary now the gospel writers    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('498')">0:08:18</a> contradict each other matthew and luke contradict 
or disagree with mark what has god reliably told    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> us about the mother of jesus and how are we to 
find out unfortunately the new testament gospels    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> are not a reliable source of information at this 
point for its reasons they say different things    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('519')">0:08:39</a> muslims as we move on to the quran now 
muslims uh hold mary in the highest regard    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('526')">0:08:46</a> a chapter in the quran itself is named 
after her surah maryam or mary the surah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('534')">0:08:54</a> about mary in fact believe it or not the quran 
refers to mary more often than the bible does    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('541')">0:09:01</a> in surah 3 42 it states the angel said to mary 
mary god has chosen you and made you pure he    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('552')">0:09:12</a> has chosen you above all women interesting so the 
quran absolutely agrees with shall we say luke's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('559')">0:09:19</a> portrait of of a woman who is all generations will 
call me blessed that's a quote from luke's gospel    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> the quran agrees with that high estimation of mary 
but disagrees with mark's uh negative portrait of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('572')">0:09:32</a> mary so how can muslims navigate the way through 
the gospels what is the truth about mary how does    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('580')">0:09:40</a> the chronic revelation see itself in relation to 
the bible and this is a really interesting point    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> i think god speaks to his prophet muhammad 
in the quran saying and unto thee o prophet    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('593')">0:09:53</a> we have vouchsafed this divine writ in other 
words the quran setting forth the truth    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">0:10:00</a> confirming the truth or whatever there 
still remains of earlier revelations and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> determining what is true therein judge then 
between the followers of earlier revelation    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('612')">0:10:12</a> in accord with what is true herein sorry 
which we've got god has bestowed on high    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('620')">0:10:20</a> and do not follow their errant views forsaking the 
truth that has come unto thee that's surah 5 48.    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('629')">0:10:29</a> so um that is the quran's view but there's a 
further verse i just want to read to you which uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('636')">0:10:36</a> has been a source of misunderstanding but i think 
also is a fruitful insight into this whole issue    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('641')">0:10:41</a> in sir number five the feast verse 116 it says 
when god says jesus son of mary did you say to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('651')">0:10:51</a> people take me and my mother as two gods alongside 
god he will say may you be exalted i would never    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('660')">0:11:00</a> say what i had no right to say if i had said 
such a thing you would have known it you know    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('666')">0:11:06</a> all that is within me though i do not know what is 
within you you alone have full knowledge of things    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('672')">0:11:12</a> unseen i told them only what you commanded 
me to worship god my lord and your lord    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> i think it's very interesting here because uh 
christians not only follow luke's gospel most    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('687')">0:11:27</a> christians follow a more catholic understanding 
say as we see in the catholic church    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('692')">0:11:32</a> and in the orthodox church and they have exalted 
her with uh great titles as mother of god spouse    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('700')">0:11:40</a> of the holy spirit spouse means husband or wife 
literally the husband or wife of god queen of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('706')">0:11:46</a> universe that's another popular title in catholic 
devotions so she has acquired i would argue and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('715')">0:11:55</a> the crown seems to say this a status as a divinity 
now formal catholic theology will tell you she is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('723')">0:12:03</a> not a divinity i want to be quite clear about that 
but i think what the quran is doing and i i think    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('728')">0:12:08</a> i see the point here is that in practice in the 
prayer and the liturgies and the language used of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('733')">0:12:13</a> her that prayer is directed to her petitions the 
helmet hail mary full of grace blessed art thou    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('739')">0:12:19</a> among women blesses the fruit of thy womb jesus 
these are actual prayers addressed to mary as uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('746')">0:12:26</a> as mother of god and i say she's called the queen 
of the universe spouse of the holy spirit ex and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('751')">0:12:31</a> many many many other titles so the quran is saying 
here is rebuking uh implicitly those christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('759')">0:12:39</a> who take mary and jesus as two gods alongside 
gods you have god the father the creator of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('766')">0:12:46</a> the universe but you also have an effect mary 
treated as divinity and her son also is proclaimed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('772')">0:12:52</a> as a divinity and you see this in iconography 
in orthodox churches and statues you will see    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('777')">0:12:57</a> particularly in the there's stunning orthodox 
icons you'll see mary and jesus very often portray    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('783')">0:13:03</a> you and see the father portrayed and they and and 
those icons are prayed to and kissed and venerated    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> as well so they are two gods alongside god i 
think the quran is using rhetorical language to uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('795')">0:13:15</a> criticize and deconstruct this kind of doxological 
prayer and liturgy that christians indulge in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('804')">0:13:24</a> so there's not meant to be a a forensic study 
of christian theology this is as he says to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('810')">0:13:30</a> jesus did you jesus then god says jesus did you 
say to people take me and my mother as two gods    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('818')">0:13:38</a> alongside god well of course not jesus didn't 
say that he said worship god alone but christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('824')">0:13:44</a> unfortunately have uh corrupted and changed that 
teaching and included when i say christians of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('830')">0:13:50</a> course i'm not referring to evangelicals you 
do not in any way shape or form worship mary    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('835')">0:13:55</a> but most christians today and throughout 
history have been of a more catholic persuasion    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('840')">0:14:00</a> and they do invoke her in prayer they do pray 
to her they uh supplicate to her they invoke her    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('845')">0:14:05</a> as the queen of heaven and as the mother of god 
and i think that's what the quran is criticizing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('851')">0:14:11</a> them for doing so i think that kind of sums up 
my my view all too briefly there's so much more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('856')">0:14:16</a> i could have said uh rush through a little bit 
they just want to give you a more academic uh    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('862')">0:14:22</a> contribution towards this discussion uh uh 
from new testament scholars themselves and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('868')">0:14:28</a> i think the fascinating contribution from 
the quran as to mary's true status as a pure    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('875')">0:14:35</a> noble woman but not as a divinity a 
quasi-divinity or natural divinity until next time
