# Christmas Message from Blogging Theology (2020-12-24)

![alt Christmas Message from Blogging Theology](UKfoEkJ_Yi0.jpg "Christmas Message from Blogging Theology")

## Description

The Bible teaches over and over that God does not change:

Malachi 3:6 - For I the Lord do not change.

James 1:17 - Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.

Numbers 23:19 - God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind.Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?

Psalm 102:25-27 - Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, but you are the same, and your years have no end.

It is a contraction to say that what is essentially immutable changes.

Also consider these contradictions:

-The man Jesus was tempted, but you can’t tempt God. 
-Jesus died, but God is immortal. 
-Jesus is under a god, but God can’t be.

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=1) hello in this episode i want to talk  
[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=3) about  
[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=4) how christians imagine the very first  
[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=7) christmas  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=8) that time when uh jesus was born 2000  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=11) years ago  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=12) in bethlehem so how do they imagine that  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=17) well i it goes something like this i  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=19) think  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=20) for them uh it starts with the  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=22) conception  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=23) when god became a fertilized egg  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=27) then god grew in uh grew as an embryo  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=31) then a fetus and then god kicked mary  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=34) from within her womb  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=37) and then at the birth on christmas day  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=39) god entered the world  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=41) as a baby amid the stench of manure  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=44) and cobwebs and hay in a stable  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=48) so the gospels tell us mary cradled the  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=51) crater in her arms i never imagined god  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=54) would look like that  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=55) she says to herself but  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=60) i would say that the idea that god  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=62) became a baby  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=64) involves some serious contradictions and  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=67) therefore it cannot be true  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=69) so consider this the idea that god the  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=72) invisible god  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=73) became visible the untouchable became  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=77) touchable  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=78) the unlimited became limited the  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=81) infinite  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=82) became finite the immutable  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=86) became mutable the unchangeable became  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=89) changeable spirit became matter  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=92) the almighty god became weak  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=97) now what lies behind all of these  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=100) beliefs these claims  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=101) is that god changes big time in his very  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=105) nature  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=107) but the bible teaches over and over that  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=110) god does  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=111) not change the prophet malachi  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=114) in chapter 3 verse 6 says for i the lord  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=118) do not change the letter of james in the  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=121) new testament  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=122) 117 says for every good and perfect gift  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=126) is from above coming down from the  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=128) father of heavenly lights  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=130) who does not change like shifting  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=133) shadows  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=135) the book of numbers says chapter 23  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=139) god is not human that he should lie  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=143) not a human being that he should change  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=145) his mind  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=146) does he speak and then not act does he  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=149) promise and not  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=150) fulfill psalm 102  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=153) tells us of old you laid the foundation  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=157) of the work of the world  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=158) and the heavens are the work of your  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=160) hands they will perish  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=162) but you will remain they will all wear  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=165) out like a garment  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=167) you will change them like a robe and  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=170) they will pass away  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=172) but you are the same and your years  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=175) have no end  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=178) so it's a contradiction to say that what  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=181) essentially what is essentially  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=182) immutable changes  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=186) now there are other contradictions uh of  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=189) which may  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=190) have occurred to you as well the idea  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=192) that the new testament teaches that  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=194) jesus  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=195) was tempted by the devil it says that in  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=197) the gospels  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=199) but it also says that you can't tempt  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=201) god  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=203) the gospels say that jesus died but god  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=207) is immortal the new testament also says  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=209) that in one timothy that god does not  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=211) die that he's immortal  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=213) jesus is under a god it says he plays  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=216) best places that jesus  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=217) has a god but god can't be god can't be  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=220) under a god obviously because god is  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=223) almighty he is the  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=224) creator of the heavens and the earth the  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=226) source of everything therefore he is not  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=228) under anyone else or they would be god  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=230) logically and there's a little verse  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=233) here in  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=233) one uh in luke's gospel uh  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=236) chapter two verse fourteen a little  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=239) verse but it's so  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=240) pregnant with her pregnant pun intended  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=244) with implications the child is referring  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=247) to jesus the child grew  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=249) and became strong filled with wisdom  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=252) and the favor of god was upon him  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=256) that's luke 2 40. so  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=259) the son jesus grew and became strong  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=263) filled with wisdom and favor the favor  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=266) of gobblers on him so this is a changing  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=268) developing  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=269) person it's not a static kind of entity  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=273) you know the god man um  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=276) so there we go so um i i think  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=279) the i the idea this christmas is that we  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=281) should  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=282) certainly reflect on the birth of a  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=285) child this child jesus  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=287) but also on the later theology that grew  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=290) up around him and that it is  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=291) if we just look at it very simply and  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=294) rationally and logically it is  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=296) contradictory  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=297) it is incoherent and therefore it can't  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=300) be true  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=300) and we should jettison this theology and  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=303) belief  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=304) and believe in something that is purer  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=306) and simpler the monotheism that jesus  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=308) himself proclaimed  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=310) to the jews a pure monotheism a sincere  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=314) monotheism  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=315) and also the prophets of course proclaim  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=317) that as well so i think that that would  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=319) be my christmas message  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=321) um to invite people to believe in that  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=324) pure monotheism what muslims call  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=327) tauheed  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=328) and just to jettison these uh  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=331) contradictory beliefs that make no sense  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=333) god doesn't change  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=335) he is immutable he is eternal he's  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=337) almighty  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=339) he is perfect he doesn't grow in wisdom  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=342) and uh god is not uh favored and the  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=345) favor of god was not upon god there is  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=347) only one god  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/UKfoEkJ_Yi0?t=348) as well and there we are until next time
