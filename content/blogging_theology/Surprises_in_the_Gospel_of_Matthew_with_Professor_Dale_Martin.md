 Professor Dale Martin discusses the differences between the Gospel of Matthew and the other gospels. He points out that Matthew is unique in its focus on the church, and its insistence on the importance of the Jewishness of the Christian faith. He also discusses the different ways scholars have organized Matthew's Gospel, and how it parallels the way the Hebrew Bible is organized.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>**  Professor Dale Martin discusses the Gospel of Matthew, highlighting its paradoxical nature as a Torah-observant Christianity and gentile mission text. He also mentions that the names attributed to the gospel text were not present in the first century, and that it was only in the second century that these titles were attached. Martin finishes by discussing how we know about the gospel's authorship and when it was written.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>**  Professor Dale Martin discusses the theory that the Gospel of Matthew was written after the events it describes had already taken place. Martin points out that the author of Matthew does not mention the destruction of Jerusalem taking place at the same time as the other events mentioned in the gospel, indicating that it was written after these events had taken place. Additionally, Martin argues that the author of Matthew likely used a written source, known as "Q," which provided him with verbatim quotations from the Gospel of Mark.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>**  Professor Dale Martin discusses the differences between the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. He points out that Matthew uses a different term, "lost sheep of the house of Israel," to refer to people who are not Jewish. He also points out that in the last verses of the gospel, Jesus tells his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations. This is significant because it shows that Jesus is not limited to the people of Israel.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>** Professor Dale Martin discusses the differences between the historical Jesus and the Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. He argues that the historical Jesus saw himself as being only a prophet to the people of Israel, while the Jesus in Matthew's community includes gentiles.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">00:20:00</a>** In Matthew, Jesus intensifies the law by putting it inside the human heart. Paul and other early Christian writers would likely disagree with this view of the law.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">00:25:00</a>** Matthew focuses on the importance of the church, and surprises viewers by mentioning the founding of the church in a unique way. This is a departure from other gospel authors, who focus primarily on the teachings of Jesus.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">00:30:00</a>**  Professor Dale Martin discusses the theology of the remnant in the Gospel of Matthew. He argues that this theology is found in other places in the first century, and that it developed quickly after the death of Jesus. He also discusses the conversion of Paul, which he believes took place around 34 AD.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">00:35:00</a>** In Matthew, Jesus commissions the disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Luke, which is proposed to be the history of the early earliest church, does not mention anyone being baptized in this triadic name. Dale Martin argues that this is because Luke is writing after the resurrection of Jesus, and baptizing in this three-fold name was developed theology.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">00:40:00</a>** Professor Dale Martin discusses the differences between the spirit in Luke and in Acts, and how the spirit is only present in Paul. He also discusses the historical context of the Gospel of Matthew, and how it forces the church to be Jewish. He also discusses how Matthew is the first gospel in the canon to insist that the church be aware of its Jewishness.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">00:45:00</a>** Professor Dale Martin discusses the different ways scholars have organized Matthew's Gospel, and how it parallels the way the Hebrew Bible is organized. He also discusses why he believes Matthew is the favorite Gospel of Jesus Christ.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3000')">00:50:00</a>**  Professor Dale Martin discusses the five gospels, noting that although they have similar themes, each gospel has its own unique content. He also comments on the Gospel of Thomas, which he believes is not a gospel but rather a series of sayings.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2')">0:00:02</a> Good evening everyone and welcome to Blogging
Theology. My name is Paul Williams. I'm calling
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6')">0:00:06</a> from the South of France today and I'm honoured
again to have as our guest Dale Martin who I
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('14')">0:00:14</a> understand is in Texas in the USA and a professor
at Yale University and other places as well.
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('22')">0:00:22</a> And he is today going to talk us through aspects
of the Gospel of Matthew. This is the first gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('30')">0:00:30</a> in the New Testament and by way of Overview of
this brief introduction i just want to read a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('36')">0:00:36</a> few words from his book one of many books: New
Testament History and Literature, published by Yale
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('43')">0:00:43</a> University Press and in chapter 7 The Gospel of
Matthew he writes as an overview 'The Gospel of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('50')">0:00:50</a> Matthew contains some of the most famous passages
that both Christians and non-christians recognize
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('57')">0:00:57</a> but matthew presents itself paradox paradoxically
as preaching both a Torah-observant Christianity
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('65')">0:01:05</a> and a gentile mission a christian mission to
gentiles the figure of Jesus in matthew is as
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('73')">0:01:13</a> a teacher the founder of a church uniquely uh the
model for the apostles and matthew's own community
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('81')">0:01:21</a> matthew is writing for a church community that
needs encouragement to have faith uh in a time of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('87')">0:01:27</a> trouble and then the first sentence on the chapter
itself the gospel of matthew from the second
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('94')">0:01:34</a> century on has been the most popular gospel which
is probably why it ended up first in our bibles
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('102')">0:01:42</a> um there's a lot there particularly the
paradoxical bit which i really like to explore
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('106')">0:01:46</a> but dale could you just i really want to know who
wrote this gospel who is the author and um and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> when was it written because we've all been told
christians have been told for most of the last
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('117')">0:01:57</a> 2000 years that a disciple called matthew um the
tax collector disciple of jesus himself authored
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('125')">0:02:05</a> the text but i've heard rumors that scholars don't
believe this anymore and why would they doubt
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('131')">0:02:11</a> such a such an obvious truth this is by an apostle
himself well one of the things you have to realize
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> is that um none of the names that are attached
to the gospels in the bible were part of the text
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('149')">0:02:29</a> they all they weren't there in the first century
we can't find any reference in the first century
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> that matthew wrote matthew mark wrote mark
blah blah blah um the the type the names of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('166')">0:02:46</a> these gospels got attached to the gospels only
in the second century and most of us think it
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> was only in the late second century you know
after 150. well why would you believe something
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('181')">0:03:01</a> uh that's a hundred years separated from
when it was supposed to have happened
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('188')">0:03:08</a> um i mean just think about it we you know we just
separated the first anniversary of juneteenth here
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> in texas in galveston as a matter of fact where
i'm sitting right now this was the day in june
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> when black people were first told that they were
free they had been freed for two years by the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('213')">0:03:33</a> emancipation proclamation but they weren't told
um and so we celebrate juneteenth as uh june 19th
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223')">0:03:43</a> is the date when uh emancipation was proclaimed
in texas and it was proclaimed in four different
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> buildings in galveston and then it spread out
throughout the state of texas now imagine that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('239')">0:03:59</a> you know that was only a hundred years ago how
do we know about that well we have newspapers
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('249')">0:04:09</a> from the time we have letters we have people's
accounts we even had live memories of people who
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('256')">0:04:16</a> were alive back then who can tell us uh what
it was like when they first heard about it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('265')">0:04:25</a> there was nothing like that for the
gospels there were no newspapers
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('269')">0:04:29</a> there was no uh tv there was no radio there was no
nothing you just had these papyrus texts that were
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('277')">0:04:37</a> floating around being shared by different
church groups and they were probably just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('283')">0:04:43</a> small house churches and they would copy them out
by hand and send them a copy to somebody else but
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('291')">0:04:51</a> that's all there was so how do you know that the
gospel of matthew that never gets the name matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> attached to it until sometime after 150 how do
you know that goes back to the year 35 or 40.
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> it's just unbelievable you just have to you just
have to work with some historical skepticism
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> so there's simply no evidence that matthew
the author uh wrote it uh himself because as
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('324')">0:05:24</a> you say it was a later second century idea that
materialized uh but but also is it not the case
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('331')">0:05:31</a> that i mean how significant is it when i read that
gospel it's not in the first person it's not i'm
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('337')">0:05:37</a> it's not implying an eyewitness account it reads
like a third person account he did this and he's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> not that in fact third fourth fifth sixth person
account matthew never says oh well there was that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('351')">0:05:51</a> time when jesus and i were sitting by the sea of
galilee and he handed out a bunch of fish and he
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('358')">0:05:58</a> did this or that there's nothing like that and
in fact we know that whoever wrote the gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('364')">0:06:04</a> of matthew used the gospel of mark as a source he
just copies it out verbatim at times he also uses
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('372')">0:06:12</a> a source that the gospel of luke uses that we tend
to call q which just comes from the german word
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('380')">0:06:20</a> which is just the german word for source you know
german scholars just decided well look there was
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> some written document that luke and matthew use
that's not in mark these are sayings they're not
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('393')">0:06:33</a> in mark but they are verbatim the same you know
blessed are blah blah blah you know you are the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('402')">0:06:42</a> salt of the earth you know uh how did matthew and
luke come up with these sayings neither of them
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('408')">0:06:48</a> appears to be a follower of jesus so they're
getting it from a written source so matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('414')">0:06:54</a> and luke are using a written source of mark and
they use a written source that we call q it's a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('421')">0:07:01</a> hypothetical written source and some people doubt
that it never existed but i don't see how they can
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> get around it because it's verbatim and matthew
and luke and if if you put matthew and luke next
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> to one another they don't look like they copied
each other no and so where did they get these
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> verbatim quotations well one of the things that
impresses me is uh if you look in mark's gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('445')">0:07:25</a> mark chapter 13 you get this long discourse
where jesus is talking about the destruction
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('450')">0:07:30</a> of the temple and the the return of the son of
man and so on and in the middle of this discourse
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455')">0:07:35</a> it jesus says apparently in parenthesis let the
reader understand i'm thinking hang on this is
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('462')">0:07:42</a> not reading this is jesus talking to disciples and
then you get an identical phrase in matthew's uh
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> version of the same episode in matthew 24 where
it says lo and behold halfway through let the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> reader understand what a coincidence um unless
of course uh as you're suggesting that one gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('480')">0:08:00</a> is common from another and it's clearly a
written account let the reader understand
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('485')">0:08:05</a> um but that's a that's a great place to go for the
idea of when it was written right according to the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('492')">0:08:12</a> gospel of mark the gospel of mark in chapter
13 which we're talking about says right now
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('500')">0:08:20</a> at this point jesus is going to come back
the angels are going to come in and we're
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> going to have the big blow up of the world and
we're going to have the kingdom of god come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> matthew doesn't like that and luke doesn't
like that because it sounds like mark is saying
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('521')">0:08:41</a> right when the romans are surrounding
jerusalem which happened what 69 and 70 right
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('529')">0:08:49</a> so the gospel that's why we say the gospel of mark
was probably written around the year 70 because
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('536')">0:08:56</a> he tells the story of what's going
to happen with the romans and the war
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('542')">0:09:02</a> against the jews and he tells it all up
against the year 70 and he says that's when
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('548')">0:09:08</a> jesus is going to come or jesus is basically
saying that's when the son of man is going to come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('556')">0:09:16</a> did it happen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('559')">0:09:19</a> not not according to any of us we're still
here um and so matthew and luke change that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('569')">0:09:29</a> they change it very slightly um luke puts in this
thing saying you will get the romans surrounding
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('577')">0:09:37</a> jerusalem and they will be around jerusalem and
you'll get jerusalem destroyed so luke even has
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> the destruction of jerusalem and he's copying
this out of mark and yet he's changing it all
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('592')">0:09:52</a> to bring it up today and so mark didn't talk about
the destruction of jerusalem happening right then
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('598')">0:09:58</a> luke adds that because he's sitting over there i
think luke was probably sitting in i don't know
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('604')">0:10:04</a> galilee or asia minor or some place and he's
looking over there in the palestine he goes
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('610')">0:10:10</a> the romans destroyed jerusalem so why didn't
jesus come back and so luke brings it up to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('618')">0:10:18</a> date and he says then you'll have jerusalem where
we trampled down until the times of the gentiles
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('627')">0:10:27</a> the times of the gentiles well what does
that mean mark didn't say anything about that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('632')">0:10:32</a> no and matthew doesn't say anything about
that either which is why one of the reasons
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('636')">0:10:36</a> i don't think matthew knew luke um why wouldn't
matthew copy some of luke into his own gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643')">0:10:43</a> he doesn't he uses a mark and then he goes off on
his own but matthew also knows that the time of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('651')">0:10:51</a> the end that mark predicted didn't happen and so
you get you get time kind of factored in both in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('661')">0:11:01</a> matthew and in luke which is why we know i mean if
you're gonna practice this historical critical uh
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('670')">0:11:10</a> game at all then you use this kind of stuff you
say you know why do they tell the story of the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('679')">0:11:19</a> end of time differently it's because they lived at
different times so there's a bit of detective work
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('690')">0:11:30</a> really isn't it you've got to be someone with an
acute be blunt an acute intelligence a desire to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('696')">0:11:36</a> really notice these subtle differences
my case you just have to go to school
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('705')">0:11:45</a> and and from that you can actually really get a
sense of what might be going on have one gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('710')">0:11:50</a> change the other gospel and why would they do it
what's the agenda what's going on rather than just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('715')">0:11:55</a> seeing the differences are there's eyewitness
accounts people traditionally say well matthews
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('718')">0:11:58</a> and i when is mark no we were dealing here with
people copying and changing and editing redacting
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('724')">0:12:04</a> each other and that can tell us a lot about their
agenda and what their theology is and what their
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('729')">0:12:09</a> physiology is and their eschatology and how that's
changed because of the flow of time history itself
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('736')">0:12:16</a> has had to change things because here we get
to the contradictions in matthew that you were
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('742')">0:12:22</a> talking about why is it that matthew wants
his church to be a law abiding torah keeping
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('751')">0:12:31</a> a basically jewish church and yet at the the last
verses of the gospel jesus tells the disciples
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('761')">0:12:41</a> to go and make disciples of all nations the word
nations is directly ethnoi it's that word ethnos
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('770')">0:12:50</a> we can translate it nations but it means all
the different ethnic groups so yeah matthew's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('778')">0:12:58</a> having jesus at the very last so here's what
i think is going on first you have to say
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('784')">0:13:04</a> there are different levels as i've
said there's the historical jesus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('789')">0:13:09</a> and jesus may have said things that got into
matthew's gospel um that the historical jesus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('798')">0:13:18</a> actually said would an example of that be the
canaanite woman her faith in matthew 15 yes
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('806')">0:13:26</a> can i just read that out for people i know you
know it but just so because i think it's a really
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('810')">0:13:30</a> significant passage in the light of what happens
at the end of the gospel so according to this
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('815')">0:13:35</a> is the nrsv uh version jesus left that place
and went away to the district of ty and sidon
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('821')">0:13:41</a> just said a canaanite woman this is not a
jews a gentile from that region came out
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('826')">0:13:46</a> and started shouting have mercy on me lord son
of david my daughter is tormented by a demon
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('832')">0:13:52</a> but he did not answer her at all
really important silence and his
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('838')">0:13:58</a> disciples came and urged him saying send
her away but she keeps shouting after us
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('844')">0:14:04</a> he answers jesus this is the killer the key thing
i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('852')">0:14:12</a> of israel was only sent to the lost sheep of
the house of israel not even all israel just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('856')">0:14:16</a> for the lost sheep of the house of israel but she
knelt before him saying lord help me he answered
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('862')">0:14:22</a> uh it is not fair to take the children's food this
is the israelites food and throw it to the dogs
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('868')">0:14:28</a> oh she said yes lord yet even the dogs eat
the crumbs that fall from their master's table
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('876')">0:14:36</a> then jesus answers her woman great is your
faith let it be done for you as you wish and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('882')">0:14:42</a> her daughter was healed instantly so here we have
a series of rebuffs from from silence initially to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('890')">0:14:50</a> the disciples urging jesus to send her away then
jesus saying look i'm not sent to you go away
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('895')">0:14:55</a> and then you get a clever faithful response than
this gentile and because of this exceptional
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('901')">0:15:01</a> response great is your faith he actually accedes
to her request and does actually heal the daughter
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('908')">0:15:08</a> immediately apparently but this seems to be an
exception rather than the rule but you're clear
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('913')">0:15:13</a> clearly the disciples and jesus did not want to
deal with her and yet at the end of this very same
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('919')">0:15:19</a> gospel jesus teaches the very same disciples
go into all the nations the ethnic the ethnos
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('927')">0:15:27</a> and teaching them to obey everything that i've
commanded you and baptized them etc etc and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('932')">0:15:32</a> i'm thinking what's going on here matthew what's
going on you've got jesus who said look i'm only
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> sent to the jews and then he's changed his mind
i mean what is jesus mission but you're saying
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('944')">0:15:44</a> that we're dealing with different levels of
history here you're saying the historical jesus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('950')">0:15:50</a> whatever that means uh was restricting his mission
to the israelites but the church after paul
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('960')">0:16:00</a> in the 80s 90s was largely a gentile organization
movement and so you had different levels of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('968')">0:16:08</a> um discourse going on here you have
the historical jesus you have the later
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('972')">0:16:12</a> gentile church and then you have matthew's
community which includes gentiles presumably now
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('979')">0:16:19</a> am i am i on the right this is what you're saying
a little bit yes but i don't want to make it
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('984')">0:16:24</a> i don't want to make it too clearly
simply the historical jesus versus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('988')">0:16:28</a> the textual jesus of matthew because i
believe that even in matthew there are layers
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('994')">0:16:34</a> of meaning um i do believe that the historical
jesus saw himself as being only a prophet
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1002')">0:16:42</a> to the people of israel i think that he
was a disciple of john the baptist i think
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1009')">0:16:49</a> he was baptized by john the baptist i think he
thought he was inferior to john the baptist um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1018')">0:16:58</a> and yet after john the baptist was arrested
and killed jesus comes out of the closet
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1027')">0:17:07</a> and starts um speaking more openly
well did he did he have a change in his
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1035')">0:17:15</a> self-concept i don't know but see
that's getting way back into the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1040')">0:17:20</a> undiscoverable historical jesus stuff
right but even in matthew there's a tension
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1048')">0:17:28</a> um for example matthew i think matthew drew a
line between jesus in his ministry in israel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1063')">0:17:43</a> uh which matthew would have included
all of palestine including galilee and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1073')">0:17:53</a> and then jesus after his death  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1078')">0:17:58</a> and i think that jesus he recognized and i think
this is where matthew is probably historically
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1083')">0:18:03</a> accurate he recognized that jesus saw
himself as being sent only to israel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1093')">0:18:13</a> but matthew's church is a combined
church of jews and gentiles
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1098')">0:18:18</a> and so he has to believe that somehow jesus's
will was to include the gentiles into israel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1107')">0:18:27</a> and i don't mean that he wanted the church to be
gentile he wanted the gentiles to become israel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1115')">0:18:35</a> that's why matthew never says unlike paul would
say or luke would say or other new testament
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1123')">0:18:43</a> rather than say that gentiles don't have to keep
the law matthew insisted that everyone in his
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1129')">0:18:49</a> church keep the law yeah the gentiles included the
same entirely you have to follow the sabbath laws
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1136')">0:18:56</a> the kosher food laws and be certain the males be
circumcised gently exactly there's not one hint
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1144')">0:19:04</a> in any of the gospel of matthew that he believed
that gentile believers didn't have to keep the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1152')">0:19:12</a> entire torah how however he understood it now of
course in matthew's day there were lots of ways of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1159')">0:19:19</a> interpreting the torah so for example some people
said you know you couldn't rub your hands together
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1165')">0:19:25</a> with grain on the sabbath that's breaking the
sabbath well matthew doesn't believe that uh
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1171')">0:19:31</a> some people say you have to wash your hands before
you eat or handle matthew doesn't believe that so
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1178')">0:19:38</a> he said he has jesus disciples not washing their
hands and jesus calls that oh that's just your the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1185')">0:19:45</a> tradition of your elders but nowhere does jesus
in matthew say moses said to you and i'm throwing
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1197')">0:19:57</a> it out in fact in the center of the mount jesus
says moses says to you do not commit adultery  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1208')">0:20:08</a> i say to you do not even look at a woman with
the intention of committing adultery notice
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1215')">0:20:15</a> jesus is not throwing away the anti-adultery
commandment he's making it harder to keep
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1220')">0:20:20</a> it's intensifying it it's making
it more difficult in a way because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1227')">0:20:27</a> intensely personal into the heart rather than
just mere external obedience in matthew jesus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1233')">0:20:33</a> internalizes the mosaic law and puts it inside
the human being which makes it even harder to keep
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1242')">0:20:42</a> right um you might say don't you know don't kill
well jesus says in matthew don't even be angry
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1254')">0:20:54</a> what do you mean don't be angry how can you
not be angry jesus intensifies the torah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1263')">0:21:03</a> in matthew this is totally different from luke
and ax and paul totally different so matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1274')">0:21:14</a> has a jesus who's completely jewish completely
torah observant and yet at the very end he says
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1281')">0:21:21</a> go get the gentiles and bring them in but notice
he doesn't say they get to stay gentiles they have
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1290')">0:21:30</a> to keep the law also now he doesn't say they have
to become jews so that's a difference but i don't
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1295')">0:21:35</a> know what he would call them he doesn't call them
jews but he doesn't call them gentiles if you look
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1302')">0:21:42</a> at the word gentile in matthew matthew never uses
the word gentile for people in his own community  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1312')">0:21:52</a> gentiles are out there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1315')">0:21:55</a> so matthew has this weird view that jesus opened
up the church to the nations but he didn't really
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1326')">0:22:06</a> open it up to gentiles did he because they have
to keep the law also but this is why what you're
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1334')">0:22:14</a> saying is so um shocking really to the uninitiated
you write on page 99 most christians have been
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1341')">0:22:21</a> taught traditionally and at one time or another
that christianity represents the supersession the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1348')">0:22:28</a> superseding of judaism the thing that makes jews
and christians alike is their worship of the same
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1355')">0:22:35</a> god what separates them is that christians need
not follow jewish law it surprises people when
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1362')">0:22:42</a> they come to realize as modern scholars have done
that this is not at all the attitude to the law in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1370')">0:22:50</a> matthew and then you go on which i won't read
uh to quote matthew 5 17-20 and you also later
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1376')">0:22:56</a> on quote uh matthew 23 verses 1 to 4 which also
kind of reinforced the same point this is really
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1383')">0:23:03</a> shocking because uh it's a kind of christianity
or kind of jewish christianity which we're just
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1390')">0:23:10</a> not familiar with today there is no such and
paul himself who predates the writing of matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1395')">0:23:15</a> arguably would uh intensely disagree with that as
well absolutely absolutely and that's why i find
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1404')">0:23:24</a> um matthew so amazing i imagine i don't know
this because we don't know we can't know this
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1414')">0:23:34</a> but i imagine matthew being a gospel that was
written for a community living somewhere in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1419')">0:23:39</a> syria which would have been a very semitic
place arabic jewish strong strong jewish
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1429')">0:23:49</a> community that's one of the
birthplaces of later rabbinic judaism
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1436')">0:23:56</a> and and his church is a law observant this is
so ironic it's a law observant mixed church
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1452')">0:24:12</a> this is the you know the young the one of the
parables in matthew that's not in any place else
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1457')">0:24:17</a> are the parables about the mixture
um there's the weeds and the wheat
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1464')">0:24:24</a> and how do you keep apart the weeds and
the wheat well you can't you just have to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1471')">0:24:31</a> wait for jesus to come and then he'll separate
the weeds and the wheat and i think that's the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1478')">0:24:38</a> way he saw his church is a mixture of jews
and gentiles that he couldn't separate out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1488')">0:24:48</a> but he wanted the gentiles to be law
observant and i believe it's because
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1497')">0:24:57</a> he just thought jesus never foresaw that there
would be a law free form of the jesus movement
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1507')">0:25:07</a> so how would the author of matthew whoever
he was have viewed paul's gospel which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1516')">0:25:16</a> a particularly lutheran reading is a law free
gospel that it completely rejects the law as
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1522')">0:25:22</a> something completely inappropriate and even
just in martyr not just ignatius of antioch
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1527')">0:25:27</a> i should say the turn of the first century uh
you know he said don't follow judy you're not
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1532')">0:25:32</a> jews you're christians don't follow this
religion this is a really convincing how
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1538')">0:25:38</a> would matthew would have viewed paul what
as a imposter an apostate a nerdy well a an
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1544')">0:25:44</a> an and not a real authentic follower of
jesus i guess if that message went well
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1550')">0:25:50</a> we know for a fact from other sources there were a
whole lot of christians who thought paul was crazy
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1557')">0:25:57</a> and wrong and heretical and
you know this is not news um
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1565')">0:26:05</a> that paul was seen as um heretical uh
but it makes perfect sense doesn't it um
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1577')">0:26:17</a> the real revolution was in people who
came along like paul and like luke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1588')">0:26:28</a> and said you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1593')">0:26:33</a> this whole thing about the torah that was
fine for a time but it's gone it's over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1603')">0:26:43</a> they were the ones who were
the red the revolutionaries  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1609')">0:26:49</a> matthew did what we should
have expected people to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1615')">0:26:55</a> so his religion his christianity if i can use
that word anachronistically his he was a jewish
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1622')">0:27:02</a> movement within judaism i guess would have been
the normative faith that the original disciples
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1629')">0:27:09</a> would have recognized as an expression of their
faith but you're saying there was a parallel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1634')">0:27:14</a> movement uh expressed bubble famously by paul
and by luke which kind of went off in a different
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1640')">0:27:20</a> trajectory and ended up with a different kind
of expression of faith law free gentile centered
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1648')">0:27:28</a> but centered on the church and this is
something else i wanted to mention in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1651')">0:27:31</a> in matthew uniquely in all of the gospels this is
a real surprise um to me i'm sure to many people
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1660')">0:27:40</a> none of the gospels mentioned jesus founding
a church anywhere apart from matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1667')">0:27:47</a> and he has jesus found the church in matthew 16 i
think it is uh and you found on peter this great
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1676')">0:27:56</a> great roman catholic phrase you know you are peter
petros the rock and on this rock i will build my
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1682')">0:28:02</a> church and the gates of hell will not
overcome it wow but for some reason
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1689')">0:28:09</a> no one else mentions this never speaks about
a church paul doesn't mention the founding
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1693')">0:28:13</a> of the church in that way on the rock on peter
surprisingly why is matthew mentioning a founding
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1700')">0:28:20</a> of the church where does that come from well
i think that you have to go back to the greek  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1708')">0:28:28</a> church is just a translation of ecclesia
which means those who are called out right now
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1715')">0:28:35</a> matthew is very very much um centered in the
prophets uh he he constructs his narrative
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1726')">0:28:46</a> to portray jesus as a prophet
who is called out of egypt
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1732')">0:28:52</a> um as a prophet like his father joseph joseph
is fashioned out of joseph in the hebrew bible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1746')">0:29:06</a> jesus comes out of egypt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1751')">0:29:11</a> so there's so much of the prophets
the israel prophets in matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1760')">0:29:20</a> and ecclesia doesn't mean church in that sense
it means the called ones the set aside ones
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1772')">0:29:32</a> the prophetic ones the ones like
jeremiah jeremiah and isaiah were called
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1782')">0:29:42</a> they weren't christians they were called uh and
that's what matthew means i think by ekklesia
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1792')">0:29:52</a> is these are the people who are called out of
israel as a remnant you know this is a thing
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">0:30:00</a> all the way through jewish history there's
a theology of the remnant there's you know
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1806')">0:30:06</a> the all the people of israel are not holy
necessarily uh according to this theology uh only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1817')">0:30:17</a> a remnant of israel is truly holy and
that's exactly what matthew believes
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1826')">0:30:26</a> but why is this if jesus did this historically
why is there no trace of this seemingly anyway
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1832')">0:30:32</a> in mark and luke and john there's no none
of this calling of a remnant that i can see
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1838')">0:30:38</a> well there's not there's not the term ecclesia
but i do i would argue that there is remnant
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1845')">0:30:45</a> theology in some of the other places too
okay um that not all of israel will be saved
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1855')">0:30:55</a> that's you know a phrase you find in
other places too okay um and so um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1866')">0:31:06</a> i think i don't think you can separate
out any of first century judaism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1875')">0:31:15</a> from remnant theology whether you're
talking about qumran the dead sea scrolls
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1883')">0:31:23</a> um john the baptist what was john the baptist
doing he was trying to call out and uh prove their
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1894')">0:31:34</a> remnant status by dipping them in
water um that's pure remnant theology
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1902')">0:31:42</a> but remnant theory is different from the more
catholic understanding which where you have the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1906')">0:31:46</a> college of the apostles you have peter of course
as the preeminent um uh the premier apostle um
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1913')">0:31:53</a> founding a church i mean this is using the word
church now as an organization and there are
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1918')">0:31:58</a> successors the apostles appoint others who will
carry on their ministry after their passing and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1925')">0:32:05</a> they pass on to their successes you have the
apostolic succession idea which is there in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1929')">0:32:09</a> the second century um of course um and you seem
to be saying that that's not quite what jesus
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1935')">0:32:15</a> is the historical so-called historical jesus
dude this is ma this is matthew's understanding
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1942')">0:32:22</a> perhaps influenced by that later first century uh
and is he is he reading back into jesus ministry
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1949')">0:32:29</a> that um that more developed understanding perhaps
embryonically there in the remnant theology
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1954')">0:32:34</a> you mentioned he's he's working it towards a
more developed ecclesiology i don't i don't
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1962')">0:32:42</a> i would not want to read any of matthew
in those second century terms i think the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1969')">0:32:49</a> establishment of uh catholic christianity takes
decades and decades and decades to development
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1978')">0:32:58</a> to develop when paul when matthew says you are
peter and upon this rock i will build my church
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1988')">0:33:08</a> i i just resist reading that in later catholic
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1993')">0:33:13</a> uh foundational theology i just don't think
that's what i don't think it i don't think
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1998')">0:33:18</a> number one the historical jesus ever said that
number two i don't think that's what matthew meant
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2005')">0:33:25</a> i think what matthew meant was this is what i'm
gonna found my remnant theology on is on your
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2014')">0:33:34</a> confession and that confession being true for
other people um and i do believe that matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2024')">0:33:44</a> came to believe that jesus was the messiah
which i do believe took time to develop  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2033')">0:33:53</a> i don't think anybody in the year 30 thought jesus
was the messiah uh much less jesus um but it was
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2044')">0:34:04</a> a belief that's developed after that to the point
it developed quickly i think so that i would place
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2053')">0:34:13</a> uh paul's let's call it a conversion he would not
call it a conversion because he didn't convert
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2059')">0:34:19</a> from one religion to another but his call to be an
apostle i think paul that happened in around the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2066')">0:34:26</a> year 34 and i think the death of jesus happened
around the year 30 four years is not very long
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2076')">0:34:36</a> for this kind of stuff to develop but paul thought
that he was called by jesus of nazareth the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2087')">0:34:47</a> messiah hmm so in four years jesus he becomes his
name doesn't it becomes jesus christ almost like
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2095')">0:34:55</a> his second name uh it's almost the the
title sort of takes a change and becomes
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2102')">0:35:02</a> it is tight as his name jesus christ yeah
we used to joke about him and say you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2110')">0:35:10</a> h was not jesus's middle name jesus christ
you know right can i just tackle one other
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2118')">0:35:18</a> thing at the very end of matthew uh we've kind of
alluded to already that jesus uh this is after the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2123')">0:35:23</a> resurrection and he commissions the disciples
to go into all the world as we've discussed
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2128')">0:35:28</a> and then he says go therefore make disciples
of one nation baptizing them in the name of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2132')">0:35:32</a> the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
and it's that that struck me but when when i read
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2140')">0:35:40</a> acts the book of acts by luke which is proposed
to be the history of the early earliest church
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2145')">0:35:45</a> from the resurrection of jesus onwards i i don't
see anyone baptizing them in this three-fold name
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2153')">0:35:53</a> and i i don't understand why because i've heard
some people say oh well luke doesn't need to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2159')">0:35:59</a> mention all the names he's just abbreviating it
to jesus because that's the baptized the name of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2164')">0:36:04</a> jesus but then i think also it's very you know
some people say that this is a very developed
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2170')">0:36:10</a> theology where the talk of father's son and holy
spirit is almost trinitarian if one can use that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2177')">0:36:17</a> term anachronistically perhaps so it seems to
be more going on there perhaps than first glance
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2184')">0:36:24</a> it's uh it's a it's one of those puzzling verses
in the whole bible to me um how could you get
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2193')">0:36:33</a> let's say matthew is written around the
year 85 yeah yes it's got to be after 70
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2201')">0:36:41</a> and it's got to be long enough after that mark
has become well known and q has become well known
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2209')">0:36:49</a> um so most of us just kind of pick 85
out of the air yeah as a possibility  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2222')">0:37:02</a> and i honestly don't understand
how you could get what
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2229')">0:37:09</a> i interpret i don't interpret the full
trinity into that baptizing name of the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2235')">0:37:15</a> father-son holy spirit that would mean that
you have to believe that they're all three
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2240')">0:37:20</a> unique persons but one manifestation
different manifestations of the one god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2249')">0:37:29</a> that's just too complicated
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2252')">0:37:32</a> but that's the most trinitarian statement you'll
find anywhere in the bible and i find that amazing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2264')">0:37:44</a> i would not want to call it the trinity
yet um but it is remarkably trinitarian
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2273')">0:37:53</a> it's trinitarian structure but is there could one
interpret the words differently say the name of
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2278')">0:37:58</a> the father the father is god of course in matthew
jesus prays to god um so we have the father is god
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2285')">0:38:05</a> the son well what does the sun mean well it
can mean lots of things in the psalms it can
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2290')">0:38:10</a> mean one thing it can blessed are the peacemakers
jesus says in matthew for they should be called
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2295')">0:38:15</a> sons of god it doesn't necessarily have to
mean a person of the same stature ontology
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2301')">0:38:21</a> or uzia the same being as the father and
then you have this thing the holy spirit and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2306')">0:38:26</a> that that's why i don't know what he means but
it it could be read in a in a binary or even in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2311')">0:38:31</a> a unitarian way without just defaulting to it an
embryonic trinitarianism could it not absolutely
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2318')">0:38:38</a> in fact that's why i say i i would not want to
read into that verse a full trinitarian theology
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2326')">0:38:46</a> but simply saying those three terms in the same
statement for example why include the spirit there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2338')">0:38:58</a> or why include the sun along with the spirit
because in matthew the spirit uh actually plays a
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2346')">0:39:06</a> pretty big role you know it's in matthew that the
spirit drives him out into the desert um and in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2356')">0:39:16</a> matthew the spirit occupies you know a big place
in the beatitudes and in the sermon on the mount  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2365')">0:39:25</a> um so you would if i thought about
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2372')">0:39:32</a> what you would include baptizing them in the name
of the father and the spirit would make more sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2380')">0:39:40</a> and but then why stick in the sun  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2384')">0:39:44</a> um so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2387')">0:39:47</a> i don't want to say that it's trinitarianism
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2391')">0:39:51</a> i just want to say that it's the most
trinitarian statement we have in the bible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2398')">0:39:58</a> and and why does luke in acts fail to mention
that anyone ever baptized them in this triadic
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2406')">0:40:06</a> formula even though it's the explicit command
of jesus apparently at the end of matthew why
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2412')">0:40:12</a> is it never mentioned then obviously i would
conclude that in fact it was unknown to luke
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2417')">0:40:17</a> or the early church i think so i think
probably it was just unknown but um
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2425')">0:40:25</a> the spirit occupies a very
different role in luke and acts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2431')">0:40:31</a> the spirit is present during the
ministry of jesus but if you notice
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2440')">0:40:40</a> once jesus disappears from earth the
spirit disappears from earth also right
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2448')">0:40:48</a> and all the way through the acts of the apostles
the spirit is the main actor in fact you know i've
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2455')">0:40:55</a> taught this many times the acts of the apostles is
mistitled it's not the acts of the apostles it's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2462')">0:41:02</a> if at all the acts of peter and paul but
really what it is is the acts of the spirit
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2471')">0:41:11</a> but the spirit is never present the spirit is kind
of like off stage hollering things onto stage now
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2481')">0:41:21</a> paul you go over here to damascus now paul you're
going to go over here now uh philip you're going
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2486')">0:41:26</a> to go down to the you know river jordan the spirit
is like this off stage actor with stage directions
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2495')">0:41:35</a> telling people where to go in acts and that's
very different from the way the spirit was in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2502')">0:41:42</a> luke so i think the spirit retreats in acts to
go behind the scenes i'm not sure why that is um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2517')">0:41:57</a> maybe the author of acts had a run-in with people
who were too i don't know in our terms pentecostal
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2527')">0:42:07</a> maybe he was wary of people who
were claiming to have the spirit
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2531')">0:42:11</a> you know right on their lips all the time
so speaking in tongues happens what twice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2543')">0:42:23</a> and then it kind of disappears  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2547')">0:42:27</a> uh much to the chagrin of pentecostals well it's
all it's there in paul i guess the authentic
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2554')">0:42:34</a> paul so they can make it up from that but okay
the last thing i want to just ask in the light
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2559')">0:42:39</a> of what you have written and what you have said
about the gospel of matthew it's a jewish gospel
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2566')">0:42:46</a> by the way it does have some pretty um alarming
things in terms of our own reception of them
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2573')">0:42:53</a> today to say about the jews you know um at the
crucifixion when the jews bring upon themselves
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2579')">0:42:59</a> a curse uh both on that generation and then on
their children but given that it's a paradoxically
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2585')">0:43:05</a> a torah observant gospel uh that jesus is not
abolishing the law he actually says i have not
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2592')">0:43:12</a> come to abolish the law in the sermon on the mount
although christians have pretended to interpret
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2597')">0:43:17</a> the in the opposite way bizarrely it seems if what
you're saying is correct historically and it's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2603')">0:43:23</a> certainly the widely accepted scholarly view of
what value is this gospel for christians today and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2610')">0:43:30</a> again i'm moving beyond history now in terms of
the church the church is given this message is so
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2617')">0:43:37</a> uh different shall we say from that of paul the
churches seem to have adopted paul as their guide
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2622')">0:43:42</a> all the churches that the orthodox
the catholic the pentecostals the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2625')">0:43:45</a> episcopalians the baptists they all follow
paul seemingly in in this regard about the law
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2632')">0:43:52</a> and yet matthew doesn't so is matthew effectively
marginalized pretty much completely when
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2639')">0:43:59</a> understood correctly in his historical context no
no that's exactly uh part of the thing i want to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2645')">0:44:05</a> say about the theological appropriation of matthew
matthew forces the church to its jewishness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2657')">0:44:17</a> the church has to be jewish it can't be gentile
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2664')">0:44:24</a> it can have gentiles in it and it has to
be open to gentiles but when christians  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2673')">0:44:33</a> start forgetting that they're jewish that's heresy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2685')">0:44:45</a> and matthew is right there first in the
canon to insist that you notice that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2693')">0:44:53</a> so there's genesis at the beginning and then the
beginning of the new testament there's matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2701')">0:45:01</a> and they both start out in the beginning yeah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2705')">0:45:05</a> in the genesis the same word isn't it in greek in
matthew and in the greek translation of genesis
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2711')">0:45:11</a> in the beginning the same word and you one
thing you haven't talked about but i used to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2716')">0:45:16</a> lecture about a lot was there's different ways
to split up matthew formulaically uh one of the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2724')">0:45:24</a> ways scholars have done is say there are five
books of matthew there's the sermon on the mount
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2733')">0:45:33</a> then there's i can't remember what order they're
in but there's the apocalyptic discourses
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2740')">0:45:40</a> yeah is it matthew 10 matthew matthew 10 is the
sending out of the apostles then matthew 18 or
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2750')">0:45:50</a> something like that matthew 23 through 25 is yep
you get these five blocks of teaching which kind
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2758')">0:45:58</a> of yeah the pentateuch meaning five in green you
have five you have five blocks of teaching in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2766')">0:46:06</a> matthew yeah and some people have argued that
that's intentionally built on the pentateuch
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2775')">0:46:15</a> another way of organizing matthew though i think
jack kingsbury was famous for pointing this
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2782')">0:46:22</a> out is that you have three sections of matthew
that correspond to three journeys right um and
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2793')">0:46:33</a> that also takes its uh inspiration
from the hebrew bible right um so
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2801')">0:46:41</a> people have been very creative and i
think in perfectly legitimate ways in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2808')">0:46:48</a> mapping the gospel of
matthew onto the hebrew bible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2814')">0:46:54</a> it's like a re-expression of the hebrew
bible in greek in the new testament so you
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2822')">0:47:02</a> you said see matthew then as a useful reminder
to the the church the contemporary church about
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2828')">0:47:08</a> its jewishness its jewish heritage its jewish
understanding as a way to counter the uh the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2836')">0:47:16</a> vicious anti-semitism that was was endemic in
the church for many centuries uh until perhaps
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2843')">0:47:23</a> after the second world war with the holocaust and
that there's a you know review of that and that's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2850')">0:47:30</a> that's what's highly ironic is that you know as
we already mentioned in matthews where you get
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2855')">0:47:35</a> that awful awful blood guilt thing
upon us and our children me his blood
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2863')">0:47:43</a> you know um that's in the gospel of matthew
which is the most jewish gospel of all yeah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2872')">0:47:52</a> it's another it's full of paradoxes isn't it this
gospel whether it be jew and gentile the the law
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2877')">0:47:57</a> uh and uh and it's just so many you said to me
that matthew was your favorite gospel and i told
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2886')">0:48:06</a> it's not mine in fact i think i think matthew
is boring in a lot of places why is matthew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2892')">0:48:12</a> your favorite gospel because to me it provides uh
indirectly a root or route back to what i consider
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2901')">0:48:21</a> as a non-scholar the historical jesus more clearly
than say john does or mark does or luke by that i
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2908')">0:48:28</a> mean jesus as a torah observant jew that comes
out very clearly in matthew it's not there in
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2915')">0:48:35</a> the other gospels anything like the same extent at
all um so i i kind of meant that really that that
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2922')">0:48:42</a> it and also i like it because it's it shatters
paradigms you know as you said in your book you
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2928')">0:48:48</a> know we christians have been told we're all told
that christianity supersedes judaism jews have the
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2935')">0:48:55</a> law but christians have grace and truth and all
this matthew messes with that and refutes it big
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2942')">0:49:02</a> time and i like it for that because it has that
kind of uh shocking reality check so that those
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2948')">0:49:08</a> are concerned they come to the reasons from a
jewish point of view the law is grace and truth
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2955')">0:49:15</a> exactly exactly absolutely it is pure grace uh uh
god says that to the prophet so so i i like it for
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2963')">0:49:23</a> for uh how challenging it is either it shatters
paradigms and also it indicates something really
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2969')">0:49:29</a> important about the historical jesus i personally
understand him that he is a torah observant jew
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2973')">0:49:33</a> which has been lost in virtually all christian
discourse in the last 2000 years so i like it
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2978')">0:49:38</a> for those kinds of reasons not for any sentimental
reasons but because of its uh power to challenge
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2984')">0:49:44</a> our inherited ideas about jesus himself well but
i mean there are things to add to that i mean um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2995')">0:49:55</a> this there's no better part of the
bible than the sermon on the mount  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3003')">0:50:03</a> i was going to mention that but you seemed i
thought you're going to say you're going to
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3006')">0:50:06</a> dismiss that i think it's a marvelous a marvelous
sermon as well yeah the lesser of the peacemakers
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3014')">0:50:14</a> how can you beat that yeah yeah absolutely um
yeah no i i yeah so that's why i look lootcaster  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3028')">0:50:28</a> you you asked me to persuade you that was a
good reason or good reasons are you persuaded
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3033')">0:50:33</a> or you still think matthew is for you it's not
my favorite gospel i won't say that but i i
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3040')">0:50:40</a> see some very positive parts of it i do believe
that uh when it comes to simply quotable quotes
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3048')">0:50:48</a> matthew is about the best yeah especially
in the king james yes pretty good yeah
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3056')">0:50:56</a> good all right well um unless you want to add
anything dale i i perhaps draw it to a close there
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3061')">0:51:01</a> it's been absolutely as always a fascinating um
journey through this these gospels which are much
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3068')">0:51:08</a> more than they first seem to the the christian
and other reader i think there's much more going
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3072')">0:51:12</a> on there historically theologically creatively
and uh that sort of makes it fascinating so is
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3078')">0:51:18</a> there anything else you want to add before we
no that's fine with me perfect um obviously you
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3084')">0:51:24</a> are uh most welcome to come back again talk about
the next installment which is the gospel of luke
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3091')">0:51:31</a> next is is that right or would you
prefer to go to your number five with
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3095')">0:51:35</a> yeah because there's some really interesting
things about luke let's go chronological order
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3099')">0:51:39</a> logical order and then we can save the
best to last in john all right well thank
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3104')">0:51:44</a> you so much sir and uh the best for last means
thomas right of course there are five gospels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3114')">0:51:54</a> if you don't want to look gospel thomas is a
seriously interesting it's not a gospel it's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3119')">0:51:59</a> a series of sayings but there's some very
strange weird stuff going on in the gospels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3127')">0:52:07</a> but nevertheless some very early
stuff as well anyway that's
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3130')">0:52:10</a> another time all right well thank you so much sir
and uh until next time all right talk to you later
