<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('34)')">0:00:34 be a Muslim convert from Britain living in 
Kuwait and your experience of Life there so  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('41)')">0:00:41 I'm just gonna play that sure here we go this

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('68)')">0:01:08 of course I'm a Muslim and this is 
one of the reasons we moved here is  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('72)')">0:01:12 to be in a place where it's very easy to 
practice Islam um and Arabic and all that  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('77)')">0:01:17 kind of thing but as non-muslims there are 
plenty of non-muslims working here and I'd  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('81)')">0:01:21 love for people in the west to actually 
hear from those people who actually lived  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('87)')">0:01:27 there are so many let's just call them lies 
distributed about Islam I like women are treated  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('92)')">0:01:32 as a second if you come to the Middle East

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('123)')">0:02:03 huge following so I've had that um so you said 
several things though absolutely fascinating but  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('130)')">0:02:10 just before we get to your experience of Kuwait 
I think it's really important what you said there  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('134)')">0:02:14 could you explain how you as a a Welshman 
actually within the British Isles came to  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('140)')">0:02:20 embrace Islam I think it was some time ago wasn't 
it yes in 1999 uh back in Indonesia actually  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('150)')">0:02:30 um I uh when I left University I decided I wanted 
to travel um I graduated with electronics uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157)')">0:02:37 engineering and I wanted to travel the world but 
I didn't want to kind of just bounce around you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('163)')">0:02:43 know surfing and things like that you know not not 
saying there's anything wrong with that that's not  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('168)')">0:02:48 what I wanted to do um I wanted to actually travel 
and work so that's I managed to find myself a job  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('175)')">0:02:55 with uh a company that enabled me to do that and 
sooner or later found myself over in Indonesia  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183)')">0:03:03 um I've actually got quite a lot of videos 
on my YouTube I'm not plugging the channel  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187)')">0:03:07 I'm just I don't want to make you know um not 
to mention that yes it folks it has a YouTube  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('192)')">0:03:12 channel lots of interesting stuff on that today 
it's not plugging I'm not plugging I'm just I'm  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('196)')">0:03:16 just saying I have a bunch of I have a bunch 
of videos on my channel there um that there's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203)')">0:03:23 some videos in English I I try to do them 
in Arabic and in Indonesian as well because  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('208)')">0:03:28 um you know one of the things I like to do is is 
try my best even though I sometimes butcher it a  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214)')">0:03:34 little bit is to speak in other languages 
because it's really important to you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('218)')">0:03:38 that one of the things I've learned is when you 
speak to people in their in their own language  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223)')">0:03:43 um it makes a huge difference so yeah another 
thing which I like to try and do but yes  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('228)')">0:03:48 um so anyway to get back to the 
story um I found myself in Indonesia  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234)')">0:03:54 um yeah after about a year of being there you know 
I was told I had to to come back to the UK for uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('240)')">0:04:00 it was a kind of a monetary crisis happened 
in the world at that time back in about 1999  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('247)')">0:04:07 um so yeah I um decided that I'd ask uh my wife 
who's my wife now said to marry me and at the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('256)')">0:04:16 time she said to me look you know you're you're 
a Christian or your Christian background and I'm  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('261)')">0:04:21 a Muslim and so I you know it's not something I'm 
allowed to do I can't I can't marry a non-muslim  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('267)')">0:04:27 so you know would you consider becoming a Muslim 
so I I went and did some research I traveled back  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275)')">0:04:35 to the UK for about three months did some research 
and I became convinced uh through that research  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('284)')">0:04:44 um some might say you know you were trying to 
convince yourself because of you wanted to get  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('288)')">0:04:48 married et cetera Etc but if that was the case 
I probably wouldn't still be practicing it 22  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('293)')">0:04:53 years later so yeah so the anyway the rest 
is kind of history as they say but that's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300)')">0:05:00 that's why Indonesia is uh you know it's uh 
has a big part in my heart yeah yeah it's the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('307)')">0:05:07 biggest Muslim population in the world isn't it 
Indonesia that's right yeah that's right amazing  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312)')">0:05:12 uh and it's not an Arab country just the the first 
myth is that the largest country in the world is  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('317)')">0:05:17 not an Arab country and they don't speak Arabic 
there at least not as a national it's not their  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('321)')">0:05:21 Indonesian language isn't it it's very different 
from Arabic yeah perhaps Indonesia is a totally  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326)')">0:05:26 different language yeah absolutely yeah I think 
extraordinary now in your short clip you you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('331)')">0:05:31 stress the about the lies that are told uh in the 
west whether deliberately or just old wives tales  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338)')">0:05:38 that circulate about Islam and about the Rome 
status and experience of women in the Middle East  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('345)')">0:05:45 um and presumably in Indonesia could you just 
expand about that what what's your because  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('349)')">0:05:49 our western western perception of Islam is a very 
harsh and uh uh religion and and women are treated  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('357)')">0:05:57 badly you know we have images of the Taliban and 
so on but what's the reality in your experience  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363)')">0:06:03 of spending years in these countries um as a Brit 
and you still are a British citizen I understand  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368)')">0:06:08 so you know you what how do you experience things 
what do you see so so it's funny you should say  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('375)')">0:06:15 about the Taliban because whenever I think about 
um how a non-muslim living in the west might  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('382)')">0:06:22 perceive uh how Muslims treat or how women Islam 
are treated that's what I always think about I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('389)')">0:06:29 always think about those scenes we saw years 
ago of um you know bearded men with turbans  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('394)')">0:06:34 beating women in these blue burkas you know that 
was what was on the news so that's what stays  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('400)')">0:06:40 in your mind that's what that's what is kind of 
propagated and inculcated in the minds of people  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('406)')">0:06:46 um but when when I moved to the Middle East and 
at the time when I moved to the Middle East back  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('411)')">0:06:51 in 2005 I'd never been to the Middle East before 
I'd never been on anything it was the first time  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418)')">0:06:58 I found myself in Abu Dhabi and um I mean having 
worked over here now 15 years the there's a stark  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426)')">0:07:06 contrast between those scenes of the that I saw on 
the news which I believe is such a minority case  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('434)')">0:07:14 um I mean maybe that is happening in 
certain places maybe I really hope it isn't  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440)')">0:07:20 um because everything I've learned you 
know I sit with uh Scholars when I can  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('444)')">0:07:24 here in Kuwait and I've never I've never heard 
anything except for treat to women well the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('450)')">0:07:30 one those of you who are the best are the ones 
who your family is the best the women the best  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455)')">0:07:35 there's so many so many narrations from the 
prophet Muhammad just to pause on that very  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461)')">0:07:41 statement that that's actually a quote for 
Muhammad the the prophet uh the last prophet  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('466)')">0:07:46 so can you just repeat that again uh about 
how you treat your woman what did he say<\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('471)')">0:07:51 I'm paraphrasing so you know please don't everyone 
say oh you don't know that he's properly but I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('479)')">0:07:59 believe if I'm correct it was those of you 
who are best are those who are best to their  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484)')">0:08:04 families or he said they were your um your wives 
and I am the best of you saying that he's on the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('493)')">0:08:13 light Muslim was the best example of someone who 
treats uh his his family the best and we know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('499)')">0:08:19 yeah reverse stress on treating women in the best 
possible way if you're going to be a good Muslim  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506)')">0:08:26 follow an example of the prophet and his teaching 
then treating women very well is is absolutely  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512)')">0:08:32 essential yeah and I I urge uh non-muslim women 
who maybe have this misperception to you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('521)')">0:08:41 kindly and nicely and and neighborly approach 
uh you know Muslims in the UK or in the west uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('527)')">0:08:47 Muslim ladies and and ask them you know have have 
a chat with them have an open discussion don't you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532)')">0:08:52 know don't I'm not saying attack I'm saying just 
just try if we want to be objective and we want  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('537)')">0:08:57 to know what the truth is then it's incumbent upon 
us to ask questions openly and be objective about  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('543)')">0:09:03 it not to have a preconception in our mind because 
that preconception might be wrong you know so open  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('550)')">0:09:10 yourself up and speak to people you know we should 
do the same because we're in in the UK there's a  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('554)')">0:09:14 lot of islands if you like of people who are uh 
you know isolated if you like by culture not by  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562)')">0:09:22 Islam you know maybe there's I've seen it myself 
in the UK so you know I'd advise people to to talk  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568)')">0:09:28 to each other within within reason and and that's 
what I'm trying to do on my channel is to tell  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('573)')">0:09:33 people look you know I've been in on man I've been 
in Kuwait I've been in Saudi Arabia and I've seen  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('579)')">0:09:39 the way that people treat the men treat the women 
and it's with a great deal of respect like my wife  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('584)')">0:09:44 for example she chooses to wear the the face Veil 
she chooses to wear it I don't force it to wear it  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('591)')">0:09:51 but um when we go to the to you know to the 
supermarket or something you know people will  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('597)')">0:09:57 open the pathway for her and they'll let her in 
the door first they'll move out of the way let  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('601)')">0:10:01 her take the trolley before them they'll you know 
whatever it is it's it's wow some people might say  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606)')">0:10:06 that chauvinism I died I know but uh you know I 
wouldn't mean mind being treated like that myself  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('611)')">0:10:11 so it's very different different in Tesco's 
here in London when you're going around this  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('617)')">0:10:17 it's a it's a bit Savage for everyone for himself 
I don't think people will make I can't imagine  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('621)')">0:10:21 anyone making a way for a lady who had a hijab or 
a face Fair Lawn or maybe I'm wrong but I've not  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('627)')">0:10:27 seen it yet anyway in London I mean no it's very 
much the place in in the Middle East I mean like  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('632)')">0:10:32 I say that's one of the main reasons why you know 
we we like it in Kuwait because we feel very safe  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('637)')">0:10:37 it's a very safe place here for one so Kuwaiti 
is an expatriates right it's a safe place it's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643)')">0:10:43 a good place to bring up children obviously bring 
up families um yes um yeah absolutely there are  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('650)')">0:10:50 many places in the west where it's not not always 
a great place to bring up children for a variety  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('654)')">0:10:54 of reasons um not just a physical safety but for 
other other reasons the sense of the pressure to  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('659)')">0:10:59 change Islam to conform to certain ideological 
agendas which are being pushed very heavily  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('665)')">0:11:05 at the moment in schools and in the media 
without going into all those issues but uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('670)')">0:11:10 um you know that's quite a big issue at the moment 
so you'd obviously don't get that in Kuwait you're  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674)')">0:11:14 not your children are not being forced to um have 
different understandings of alternative Lifestyles  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('680)')">0:11:20 and so on and promote those in the schools and 
well I mean uh uh it it's a case really for me of  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('688)')">0:11:28 um the school here my kids actually they actually 
go to a British school um and I'm I'm unhappy  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('694)')">0:11:34 with what they're being taught you know we see the 
syllabus the syllabus is very much respecting the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('700)')">0:11:40 Kuwaiti um uh what's the word I'm looking for um 
the education Ministry guidelines are very clear  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('708)')">0:11:48 on what they can and can't teach and so you know 
that's that's pretty much in line you know why I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('714)')">0:11:54 moved out everything so yeah I'm not criticizing 
anyone I'm just saying this is how I choose the uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('720)')">0:12:00 to live my life and other other people may choose 
a different way but it's just unfortunate when you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('726)')">0:12:06 you know if if nobody would want me to force 
my views on them and I don't just you know we  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('732)')">0:12:12 hope to edit the reverse would be the case 
too respect so I'm just curious Are there  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('739)')">0:12:19 many other English uh or British expats living in 
Kuwait in your experience are you a small minor  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('745)')">0:12:25 um well I work in an American company and uh over 
the years well when I first came out here there  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('752)')">0:12:32 was a lot more expatriates from from various uh 
places but uh now I'd say the European countries  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('759)')">0:12:39 the Western countries have kind of petered out a 
little bit in their presence it's become more and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('765)')">0:12:45 more difficult to um to be uh you know an expat 
out here uh for various reasons financial reasons  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('774)')">0:12:54 um you know recent situation with Kobe and 
so on and so forth but for me the reason I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('780)')">0:13:00 came out here with my family it was for Islamic 
reasons so those reasons are still valid for me  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('785)')">0:13:05 and I I'm you know trying my best to uh to 
remain here for those reasons so so not as  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('792)')">0:13:12 many of us as used to be no sorry Paul so no so 
I didn't interrupt uh could you expand on what  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('798)')">0:13:18 you love about Kuwait living there as a Muslim 
which makes you want to stay there as opposed to  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('802)')">0:13:22 say living in London or Cardiff or wherever what 
what is it that you love about Kuwait islamically  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('808)')">0:13:28 that gives you that sense of wanting to really 
be there rather than anywhere else in the West  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('814)')">0:13:34 right well don't get me wrong um I'm British and 
I'm very proud of being British I'm very proud and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('820)')">0:13:40 happy for the education the upbringing um my 
parents my sister um my whole family extended  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('829)')">0:13:49 family you know everyone I'm I'm not saying in 
any way she performed that that any of that is  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('835)')">0:13:55 um something I don't like I'm very proud of 
it you know and I always say that's people but  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('840)')">0:14:00 um it was just a fact that when I was living in 
the UK it was quite difficult to to practice Islam  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('846)')">0:14:06 and and and when I when I compare it to Kuwait 
um you know it's just wonderful for example  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('854)')">0:14:14 absolutely anywhere you go there's a Masjid or a 
mosque whatever you want to want to call or as a  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('860)')">0:14:20 prayer room and any more you go to in Kuwait 
there's uh several tens of prayer rooms and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('867)')">0:14:27 the Azan will come with inside the mall um if 
you're outside and it's prayer time guaranteed  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('875)')">0:14:35 you can just pull off at the next turning 
and within two minutes you'll find a message  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('881)')">0:14:41 um so for a point of view of uh you know from 
Islam an Islamic point of view the first thing  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('887)')">0:14:47 us Muslims you know you should be thinking about 
is our is our prayers you know keeping our prayers  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('892)')">0:14:52 doing them on time praying in the congregation for 
the men and it's just very easy to do that here  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('897)')">0:14:57 right the SEC the second thing is is um this you 
know the security you feel I mean when I was in  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('903)')">0:15:03 the UK the places that I lived I always you know 
I wouldn't leave my wallet in the car or you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('908)')">0:15:08 sometimes I felt a bit worried about leaving the 
radio in the car or you know back in the days when  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('913)')">0:15:13 you had those pull-out ones um and uh yeah here 
in Kuwait I mean I've left my car open by accident  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('919)')">0:15:19 with my wallet on the seat overnight and you know 
I didn't I wouldn't feel any concern someone was  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('925)')">0:15:25 going to take it um it's a very very you know 
I and these These are these are things that you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931)')">0:15:31 know I wish in the UK that I guess the third thing 
you say is based on the security um you know like  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938)')">0:15:38 a few times especially my wife she got people 
you know wailing at her in the UK on the street  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('943)')">0:15:43 because she was wearing hijab she was a hijab name 
not the nipple and yeah well you know would scream  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('949)')">0:15:49 things at her and you know make comments and 
even myself I remember one time I was outside  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('954)')">0:15:54 a mosque in the UK and uh it all the Muslims 
in the UK know that in the summertime the Isha  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('962)')">0:16:02 prayer kind of coincides with Pub closing time so 
you know we were coming out of the mosque and the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('969)')">0:16:09 guys were coming out of the pub and you know it's 
just a bit incendiary so you know certain comments  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('975)')">0:16:15 and certain people you know they've got a bit too 
much drink in them and they might do something so  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('979)')">0:16:19 you know I I just I really just honestly Paul just 
wanted to do my own thing I don't want to bother  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('986)')">0:16:26 anyone else I just want to be safe doing it so 
over here in Kuwait it's that that's offered  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('992)')">0:16:32 wow so do you see yourself just living there 
now for the rest of your life or was that you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('997)')">0:16:37 not fought that far ahead of the house uh it's 
not I don't think it's really practical because  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1003)')">0:16:43 um in Kuwait uh it's not possible to get um 
like a permanent residency or citizenship  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1012)')">0:16:52 um so you know um that's just the nature of of 
mostly Gulf countries uh for political Dynamics  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1018)')">0:16:58 and so on and so forth it's it's you know it's 
um it's out to out of my control but uh like  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1026)')">0:17:06 I'd maybe you know like to to move to Indonesia 
at some point in the future or something like  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1030)')">0:17:10 that but as long as I can stay in Kuwait would be 
would be great yeah well I'm just curious what's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1036)')">0:17:16 the difference between being uh an expat living in 
Kuwait and an expat living in Indonesia in terms  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1041)')">0:17:21 of your experience I mean apart from things like 
the food and the climate but well I mean is there  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1045)')">0:17:25 much difference are they both equally kind of 
places you can feel at home as a practicing Muslim  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1051)')">0:17:31 you can definitely feel at home in uh in those 
places um Indonesia is uh it's a different dynamic  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1059)')">0:17:39 because the the culture is very different 
and uh obviously they don't speak Arabic but  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1066)')">0:17:46 um yeah I mean you can you can learn the 
Quran there's masjids everywhere that there's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1072)')">0:17:52 um you know practicing Muslims everywhere there's 
there's a lot of there's a big Christian Community  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1077)')">0:17:57 there's obviously a lot of Hindu community in 
Indonesia for example in Bali you know it's a  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1083)')">0:18:03 beautiful country for for like tourism and things 
like that um but so yeah they're two different  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1090)')">0:18:10 um two different Dynamics really the the Arab 
people are a different very different culture  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1095)')">0:18:15 to the Indonesians but both are very livable 
countries I mean perfectly livable and even  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1102)')">0:18:22 if you're not a Muslim both places are I've never 
seen anything but respect uh towards uh non-muslim  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1112)')">0:18:32 people in Kuwait especially especially people that 
are you know coming with like for example skills  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1116)')">0:18:36 and experience that are needed to uh to bring 
to the country and to develop the local talent  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1122)')">0:18:42 and things like that you know they're always very 
welcoming of that because you mentioned I think uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1126)')">0:18:46 a one of your Tick Tock videos I think that yeah 
there are a lot of non-muslims living in Kuwait is  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1132)')">0:18:52 that right yeah yeah not as there are how I mean 
are they allowed to practice their face in in uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1138)')">0:18:58 Kuwait absolutely yeah they have um they have like 
a couple of churches well more than a couple of  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1145)')">0:19:05 churches here I mean the established churches 
where they they go and worship on I think they  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1149)')">0:19:09 do it on Fridays here because of the way the 
weekend is but uh yeah I mean that there's no  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1154)')">0:19:14 um people are just left to to practice 
uh you know their own thing as look  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1161)')">0:19:21 I guess as long as people are not kind of um you 
know actively trying to convert people you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1167)')">0:19:27 in the streets it's not really I guess it's more 
to keep the peace you know just do your own thing  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1173)')">0:19:33 and keep yourself to yourself there's a there's a 
place for you to worship there's a place you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1178)')">0:19:38 we're just all going do our own thing and it's 
all very it all works very nicely and Indonesia  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1184)')">0:19:44 is that your experience as well in terms of the 
uh the practice of Christians and others Jews  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1189)')">0:19:49 perhaps yeah very much yeah very much I mean 
um that if you go to the biggest domestic in  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1196)')">0:19:56 Jakarta which is called it's a huge Masjid I hope 
I hope one day one day you can you can visit Paul  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1203)')">0:20:03 um if you look directly across the road there's a 
huge Cathedral you know so that just kind of goes  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1210)')">0:20:10 to tell you the dynamic in Indonesia you have 
a lot of uh you know different uh religions the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1217)')">0:20:17 panchosilla the kind of the basis of Indonesian 
um life in Indonesia it's it's uh it's like in  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1224)')">0:20:24 Indonesia and I haven't memorized it but it's 
something that the kids in Indonesia memorize at  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1227)')">0:20:27 school it's their kind of creed for Indonesia and 
it's it's freedom of uh religious worship right  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1234)')">0:20:34 because I I've had the honor of having uh Rabbi 
Toby singer on blogging Theology and he was  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1240)')">0:20:40 actually the rabbi for Indonesia at one point I 
mean really for that Nation yeah well officially I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1246)')">0:20:46 mean uh with the government and uh he's now moved 
to Jerusalem um he's an American originally he is  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1252)')">0:20:52 America um but no he had a very positive I mean 
he's a hugely popular amongst Muslims and he had  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1258)')">0:20:58 a very positive experience as a a rabbi living in 
Indonesia for a long time um doing what rabbis do  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1265)')">0:21:05 you know building communities and reaching out 
and so on so yeah and just to confirm I guess  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1270)')">0:21:10 hmm interesting that's interesting yeah I know 
he he said that um he's now in Jerusalem um  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1278)')">0:21:18 I'm not sure why he's in Jerusalem now but 
anyways not not the points anybody that goes  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1282)')">0:21:22 from Indonesia will not want to leave you know 
it's uh really it's uh such an amazing place  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1289)')">0:21:29 gosh that's amazing um well I think you talked 
about the the use quite a strong language about  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1296)')">0:21:36 the lies about Islam I mean are there any 
kind of ill kind of uh sort of fake news  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1301)')">0:21:41 items uh that that you just want to mention you 
mentioned freedom of worship freedom of religion  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1305)')">0:21:45 the status and respect shown to women you know 
even walking around the supermarket where you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1311)')">0:21:51 know courtesy these are all I think in British 
terms that will be seen as very very traditional  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1316)')">0:21:56 um etiquette and and just very well mannered 
so it wouldn't be seen as wrong I don't think  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1322)')">0:22:02 but certainly many people would see that as a 
a very respectful way of you know relating to  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1327)')">0:22:07 to men and women relating to each other but are 
there any kind of fake fake news items that uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1334)')">0:22:14 that some of us in the way still have that would 
need to be challenged do you think um the thing is  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1340)')">0:22:20 like maybe in my video I use the word lies maybe 
untruths would be a best a better way of putting  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1345)')">0:22:25 it because I don't think most of the cases that 
people actually um say things that they don't  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1352)')">0:22:32 actually lie you know on purpose we don't know I'm 
sure I'm sure there are certain things which um  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1359)')">0:22:39 you know which people deliberately mislead others 
you know to sell newspapers I don't know I'm just  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1366)')">0:22:46 um that purely would be you know just me thinking 
out loud but um I can't really think of um yeah  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1375)')">0:22:55 it seems to me it's just the perception once 
people have a perception and they commit to that  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1381)')">0:23:01 perception they talk to it to their friends about 
it and you know they express their opinions it's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1386)')">0:23:06 kind of psychologically as if they start to commit 
themselves to a particular way of thinking about  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1391)')">0:23:11 Islam and Muslims and when something comes along 
which which is counter to that perception which  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1397)')">0:23:17 they've kind of committed to because commitment 
and consistency I've talked about this in a few  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1402)')">0:23:22 of my other videos actually there's some really 
fascinating books on psychology about this  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1406)')">0:23:26 commencement and consistency is a very very 
powerful psychological uh construct in all  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1411)')">0:23:31 of our minds and I noticed this as well once 
people well you know what I've decided that  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1417)')">0:23:37 I think Muslims treat women badly yeah that's 
what I think and I also think you know x y and z  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1424)')">0:23:44 because I saw it on Fox News and I read it in this 
paper and you know that's it and I'm going to go  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1428)')">0:23:48 and talk to my friends about it they're also going 
to agree with me validation and then you start to  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1433)')">0:23:53 commit to something which is totally wrong and 
then when someone comes and challenges you and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1437)')">0:23:57 says I'm a Muslim I'm a river I became a Muslim 
you know I treat my white wife very well you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1444)')">0:24:04 um you know probably the best thing to ask 
yourself um you know ask other Muslim women  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1450)')">0:24:10 you know actually find out maybe there are some 
people that treat women badly and we've got to  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1455)')">0:24:15 forbid but that certainly isn't from Islam so if 
that's what's being propagated in the west and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1461)')">0:24:21 then the newspapers in the media if what's being 
propagated about the Middle East and Arabic people  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1466)')">0:24:26 is that they're you know all wearing turbans and 
beat their women hits this is completely false  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1472)')">0:24:32 that's it no so um you know that's what frustrates 
me and that's what I'm trying to make some content  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1477)')">0:24:37 to say you know look look at this people are 
doing their own thing people are practicing  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1482)')">0:24:42 over here this is why I'm here because I can 
hear the Adan I think it's a beautiful thing and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1487)')">0:24:47 um yeah yeah so what's the other yeah just anyone 
who doesn't know what the Adan is what is the Adan  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1494)')">0:24:54 the Azan so the Azan is the call to prayer 
line which is called five times a day  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1501)')">0:25:01 um in countries where uh people practice Islam 
obviously like Kuwait and uh in Indonesia  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1508)')">0:25:08 so um for example you have five prayers which 
is the early morning prayer uh Before Sunrise  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1519)')">0:25:19 then you have Zohar which is for example here just 
before midday then Asar Maghrib and Russia these  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1527)')">0:25:27 These are the four are five prayers sorry and then 
each these prayer times the Adan will be called  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1533)')">0:25:33 and um I'll give you a nice story 
when my father came over to to Kuwait  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1539)')">0:25:39 um he was sat here uh he was sat on on 
one of the the side of one of the rivers  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1545)')">0:25:45 um up in the town there and he heard that Adan 
being called from the other side of the creek  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1551)')">0:25:51 and uh I'd actually gone with my son to pray and 
when I came back my wife was all excited she said  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1557)')">0:25:57 God your dad he said to me he said to me wow that 
that van is beautiful it's something something I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1564)')">0:26:04 felt in it you know so I can't remember exactly 
what she said but I was quite struck by that I've  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1568)')">0:26:08 heard it from a lot of people a lot of non-muslims 
I've heard yeah then feel some kind of a spiritual  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1574)')">0:26:14 you know connection or thing British you know the 
world famous one of the of a British journalist  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1582)')">0:26:22 she went to I forget where it was certainly a 
Muslim country in her the Adan Saudi Arabia I  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1586)')">0:26:26 think that one was English oh yeah yeah and she 
was just so you know visibly moved by the whole  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1591)')">0:26:31 thing because earlier dance going off and uh 
for her it was extraordinary experience and  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1596)')">0:26:36 um I suppose it parallel here would be in the 
traditional village where you had the you know  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1600)')">0:26:40 the the the the church bells going off on a 
Sunday it still happens here actually where  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1604)')">0:26:44 I'm in London you know the bells and the 
local church will go off calling everyone  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1608)')">0:26:48 to come to church that's just like once we 
yes so it's not five times a day of course  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1616)')">0:26:56 um but it's a human voice isn't it it's not it's 
not um the Rams Horn or the bells or anything  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1621)')">0:27:01 like this is the voice of what we of the person 
we call them so Azan and the one who does the  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1628)')">0:27:08 other then is called them um and um what I was 
planning to do actually on my channel is to you  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1635)')">0:27:15 know stand outside a few massages and just uh 
just record the Adan as it's going off but it's  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1640)')">0:27:20 not the same thing as actually standing there and 
listening to it yourself it's really something uh  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1645)')">0:27:25 you know something because it's it's like 
calling one of the people in the vicinity  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1650)')">0:27:30 of this place of worship to come in inviting 
them to come and reminding them to achieve  <\/a>
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1655)')">0:27:35 worship the Creator so if if you actually 
think of it if people actually if those  <\/a>
