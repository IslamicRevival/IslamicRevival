[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=2) there are many different bibles i don't mean 
different translations but different bibles    
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=9) with different contents different 
books what exactly is the bible    
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=16) well the bible is a library of books it's 
important to understand that the the bible    
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=23) is a library of books written over a period of a 
thousand years or more by mostly unknown authors    
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=31) today christians still disagree about which 
books should be in the bible now there are many    
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=38) different canons of the bible a biblical canon 
or a canon of scripture is simply a set of books    
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=45) which a particular jewish or christian religious 
community regards as authoritative scripture and    
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=53) the english word canon comes from the greek 
word canon meaning rule or measuring stick    
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=61) roman catholics think their bible should contain 
73 books including the book of tobit the book of    
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=68) job the book of judith i should say the first 
book of maccabees the second book of maccabees    
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=75) the book of wisdom otherwise known as the wisdom 
of solomon and the book of sirach which is also    
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=81) called ecclesiasticus protestant christians think 
the bible contains just 66 books and none of the    
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=89) books i've just mentioned are part of their bible 
then there are orthodox christians you get the    
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=96) russian orthodox church the greek orthodox church 
and so on they say the bible contains 78 books in    
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=104) addition to one and two maccabees in the catholic 
version they have three and four maccabees    
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=110) however the ethiopian orthodox church believes the 
bible contains 81 books the highest figure of all    
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=119) and the ethiopian broader new testament canon 
has eight additional books in addition to the one    
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=126) the canon we normally uh aware of it has the four 
books of cynodos the two divisions of the book of    
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=133) the covenant the ethiopic clement and the ethiopic 
didascalia this is what they're called if you    
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=141) google uh the ethiopian new testament canon 
you'll see all these books detailed and discussed    
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=148) now if we go back in time 
uh to the codex sinaiticus    
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=153) this is the oldest complete bible in the world 
and it's uh in the british library uh just    
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=159) a couple of miles from where i'm sitting 
and it's a fourth century christian bible    
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=165) and the canon there reflects probably most closely 
the roman catholic canon but in the new testament    
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=173) we find the epistle of barnabas and 
portions of the shepherd of hermas    
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=179) so these are two texts that no one today thinks 
is the word of god but uh in the fourth century    
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=185) uh they were accepted as the word of god so 
it's not just a different but it's not just    
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=191) a different bible we have today different bibles 
teach different christian doctrines for example    
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=198) the question whether it's permissible to seek the 
intercession of the living for the dead and the    
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=204) existence of purgatory there's an old testament 
book called two maccabees this is accepted by the    
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=210) catholic church and the orthodox churches but not 
by the evangelical churches and if you look at 2    
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=216) maccabees chapter 12 verse 43 onwards this speaks 
explicitly about the prayer of the living for    
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=225) the dead and it's where the roman catholics also 
get the doctrine of the purgat of purgatory from    
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=232) as i say this book is in the roman catholic and 
the orthodox bible but is rejected by protestants    
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=237) and all evangelicals so when a christian 
tells you you must believe in the bible    
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=245) you must always ask them which one there 
are so many they teach different things    
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=253) given there is so much confusion amongst the 
people of the book about their scriptures and what    
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=260) they actually teach what does the quran 
say in response to this well according to    
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=268) muhammad assad's message of the quran 
translated and explained by muhammad assad    
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=273) in verse 48 of surah number 5 it says and unto 
thee o prophet we have vouchsafed this divine    
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=282) writ setting forth the truth confirming 
the truth of whatever there still remains    
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=288) of earlier revelations and determining what is 
true therein judged then between the followers    
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=296) of earlier revelation in accordance with what 
god has bestowed from on high and do not follow    
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=303) their errant views forsaking the truth that has 
come unto thee so this passage seems to clearly    
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=311) imply that the quran as a criterion as a quality 
control is to be used to discern what is true and    
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=319) what is false in the scriptures of the people of 
the book and to confirm the truth of what remains    
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=327) in those earlier revelations clearly implying 
corruption and change and alteration of the    
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=333) original scriptures given to moses and given to 
jesus and so on so the quran is as a footnote here    
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=340) is is described as the determinant factor in 
deciding what is genuine and what is false in the    
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/U1SiSCwpcVQ?t=347) earlier scriptures that's muhammad assad's note 
so i hope that was of interest until next time
