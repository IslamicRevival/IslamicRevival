<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> in this video , I want to look at how the world's 
leading philosopher changed his mind about God .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9')">0:00:09</a> Professor Anthony Flew is an English philosopher ,
most notable for his work related to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('15')">0:00:15</a> philosophy of religion . during the course of his 
career he taught at the universities of Oxford ,   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('20')">0:00:20</a> Aberdeen (Scotland) , Keel , Reading and at York university 
in Toronto . for much of his career , Anthony Flew  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('27')">0:00:27</a> was known as a strong advocate of atheism arguing 
that one should presuppose atheism until empirical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('35')">0:00:35</a> evidence of a god surfaces . he also criticized the 
idea of life after death , the free will defense to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('43')">0:00:43</a> the problem of evil and the meaningfulness of 
the concept of god . however in 2004 , he changed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('51')">0:00:51</a> his position , he changed his mind and stated 
that he now believed in the existence of an    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('58')">0:00:58</a> intelligent creator of the universe . shocking 
his colleagues and fellow atheists . in order    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('65')">0:01:05</a> to further clarify his personal concept of god ,
Anthony Flew openly made an allegiance to deism    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('72')">0:01:12</a> more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian god 
which he will define in his book in a second . and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('79')">0:01:19</a> dismissed on many occasions any call to convert 
to christianity , islam or any other religion .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('86')">0:01:26</a> he stated that in keeping with his lifelong 
commitment to go wherever the evidence leads .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('92')">0:01:32</a> he now believed in the existence of a god . i just 
want to quote some passages from his last book   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('100')">0:01:40</a> "THERE IS NO GOD" where the N has been crossed 
off gotten "THERE IS A GOD : how the world's most    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('107')">0:01:47</a> notorious atheist changed his mind" by Anthony Flew .
and I've read all this book and I wanted to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> quote some of the juicier passages from it . in 
chapter four entitled "a pilgrimage of reason"    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('120')">0:02:00</a> he writes : let us begin with a parable , imagine 
that a satellite phone is washed ashore on a    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> remote island inhabited by a tribe that has never 
had contact with modern civilization . the natives    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('136')">0:02:16</a> play with the numbers on the dial pad and hear 
different voices upon hitting certain sequences .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('143')">0:02:23</a> they assume first that it's the device that 
makes these noises , some of the cleverer    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('149')">0:02:29</a> natives , the scientists of the tribe assemble 
an exact replica and hit the numbers again .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> they hear the voices again , the conclusion 
seems obvious to them . this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('163')">0:02:43</a> particular combination of crystals and metals 
and chemicals produce what seems like human    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('169')">0:02:49</a> voices and this means that the voices are simply 
properties of the device . but the tribal sage    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('178')">0:02:58</a> (by sage Flew probably means a philosopher) a tribal 
sage summons the scientists for a discussion .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> he has thought long and hard on the matter 
and has reached the following conclusion :   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('190')">0:03:10</a> the voices coming through the instrument must 
be coming from people like themselves , people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> who are living and conscious although speaking in 
a different language . instead of assuming that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('204')">0:03:24</a> voices are simply properties of the handset , they 
should investigate the possibility that through    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('210')">0:03:30</a> some mysterious communication network they 
are in touch with other humans . perhaps further    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('216')">0:03:36</a> study along these lines could lead to a greater 
understanding of the world beyond their island .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223')">0:03:43</a> but the scientists simply laugh at the 
sage and say , look when we damage the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('229')">0:03:49</a> instrument the voices stop coming , so they're 
obviously nothing more than sounds produced by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('236')">0:03:56</a> a unique combination of lithium and printed 
circuit boards and light and missing diodes .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('244')">0:04:04</a> and a parable . in this parable we see how 
easy it is to let preconceived theories    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('252')">0:04:12</a> shape the way we view evidence ,
instead of letting the evidence    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('256')">0:04:16</a> shape our theories . a copernican leap may thus 
be prevented by a thousand ptolemaic epicycles .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('266')">0:04:26</a> defenders of ptolemy's geocentric model of the 
solar system resisted copernicus's heliocentric    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('273')">0:04:33</a> model by using the concept of epicycles to 
explain away observations of planetary motion that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('281')">0:04:41</a> conflicted with their model . and in this it seems 
to me lies the peculiar danger , the endemic evil    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('290')">0:04:50</a> of dogmatic atheism . (remember Anthony Flew was himself 
a dogmatic atheist) . take such utterances as quote :  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> we should not ask for an explanation of how it is 
that the world exists , it is here and that's all . or :   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('307')">0:05:07</a> since we cannot accept a transcendent source 
of life , we choose to believe the impossible    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('315')">0:05:15</a> that life arose spontaneously by chance 
for matter . or : the laws of physics    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('323')">0:05:23</a> are lawless laws that arise from the void , end of 
discussion . these quotes look at first sight like   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('331')">0:05:31</a> rational arguments that have a special 
authority because they have a no-nonsense    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('337')">0:05:37</a> air about them . of course this is no more sign 
that they are either rational or arguments .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('347')">0:05:47</a> and then the next quote : as for my new position 
on the classical philosophical debates    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('355')">0:05:55</a> about god , in this area i was persuaded above 
all by the philosopher David Conway's argument   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('362')">0:06:02</a> for god's existence in his book "The Recovery of 
Wisdom : From Here to Antiquity in Quest of Sophia"  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('370')">0:06:10</a> Conway is a distinguished British Philosopher 
at Middlesex University , who is equally at home   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('375')">0:06:15</a> with classical and modern philosophy . the god whose 
existence is defended by Conway and myself (writes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('383')">0:06:23</a> Flew) is the god of aristotle .Conway writes : in sum ,
to the Being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('393')">0:06:33</a> whom he considered to be the explanation of the 
world and its broad form , Aristotle ascribed the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('401')">0:06:41</a> following attributes : immutability , immateriality , 
omnipotence , omniscience , oneness or indivisibility ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('410')">0:06:50</a> perfect goodness and necessary existence . there is 
an impressive correspondence between this set of   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418')">0:06:58</a> attributes and those traditionally ascribed 
to god within the judeo-christian tradition ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('424')">0:07:04</a> it is one that fully justifies us in 
viewing Aristotle as having had the same divine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> being in mind as the cause of the world that is 
the object of worship of these two religions . end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> quote . for some reason Flew doesn't even think about 
Islam but obviously this applies to Islam as well .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('444')">0:07:24</a> so that clarifies Flew's own concept 
of god that he embraced after leaving atheism .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('453')">0:07:33</a> and now some of the reasons , the scientific reasons 
why he began to embrace theism or belief in god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('460')">0:07:40</a> and he quotes Paul Davis the famous 
astrophysicist : Paul Davis highlights the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> same problem he writes . he observes that most 
theories of biogenesis (biogenesis is the idea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('473')">0:07:53</a> of life just coming about , apparently out 
of nowhere) most theories of biogenesis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('478')">0:07:58</a> have concentrated on the chemistry of life . but 
life is more than just complex chemical reactions .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> the cell also is an information storing processing 
and replicating system . we need to explain the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('495')">0:08:15</a> origin of this system , of this information and the 
way in which the information processing machinery  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> came to exist . he emphasizes the fact that the 
gene is nothing but a set of coded instructions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('510')">0:08:30</a> with a precise recipe for manufacturing proteins .
most important these genetic instructions are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> not the kind of information you find in 
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('523')">0:08:43</a> rather they constitute semantic information .
in other words , they have a specific meaning .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532')">0:08:52</a> these instructions can be effective only in a 
molecular environment capable of interpreting the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('539')">0:08:59</a> meaning in the genetic code . the origin question 
of biogenesis rises to the top at this point ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('548')">0:09:08</a> the problem of how meaningful or semantic 
information can emerge spontaneously from a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('554')">0:09:14</a> collection of mindless molecules subject to 
blind and purposeless forces present a deep    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('561')">0:09:21</a> conceptual challenge . there's the end of that quote . 
so you can see some of the reasons why Flew in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('569')">0:09:29</a> light of modern science abandoned atheism . and 
the last quote here because there are so many .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('579')">0:09:39</a> is again to do with the origin of life , 
so how do we account for the origin of life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('583')">0:09:43</a> (professor Flew asks) the nobel prize winning 
physiologist George Wald  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('592')">0:09:52</a> once famously argued that we choose to believe the 
impossible that life arose spontaneously by chance .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('601')">0:10:01</a> now of course this is what Flew himself 
believed , this is what atheists believe .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> this Noble prize winning scientist says : in later 
years however , he concluded that a pre-existing    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('613')">0:10:13</a> mind which he posits as the matrix of physical 
reality compose the physical universe that breeds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('620')">0:10:20</a> life.  then he quotes the nobel
prize-winning professor    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('628')">0:10:28</a> who says as follows : how is it that 
with so many other apparent options  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('635')">0:10:35</a> we are in a universe that possesses just that 
peculiar nexus or properties that breeds life .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643')">0:10:43</a> it has occurred to me lately i must confess with 
some shock at first to my scientific sensibilities  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('650')">0:10:50</a> that both questions might be brought 
into some degree of congruence .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> this is with the assumption that mind rather than 
emerging as a late outgrowth in the evolution of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> life has existed always as the matrix the 
source and condition of physical reality    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('671')">0:11:11</a> that the stuff of which physical reality is 
constructed is mind stuff . it is mind that has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('679')">0:11:19</a> composed a physical universe that breeds life . so 
eventually evolves creatures that know and create  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('688')">0:11:28</a> science , art , technology making creatures .
that's the end quote there . and then Flew says :  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> this too is my conclusion , the only 
satisfactory explanation for the origin of such    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('702')">0:11:42</a> end directing self-replicating life as we 
see on earth is an infinitely intelligent    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('709')">0:11:49</a> Mind (with a capital M) . and of 
course we call that mind "God" .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('717')">0:11:57</a> so there we go , that's the book . it's 
very interesting his arguments are based he says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('724')">0:12:04</a> his whole position has not really changed , he 
only goes where the evidence leads so he says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('730')">0:12:10</a> that in his earlier career he didn't see any 
good evidence for the existence of god he says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('735')">0:12:15</a> but now with the advent of the discovery of DNA 
and the role of genes and producing proteins and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('742')">0:12:22</a> this the semantic nature of genes 
requiring a meaningful understanding of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('749')">0:12:29</a> whole process of producing genes and life .  
this goes way beyond atheism and this suggests  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('755')">0:12:35</a> intelligence , it suggests mind and thus it's just 
God not just the DNA but a whole host of other   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('762')">0:12:42</a> scientific discoveries lead professor Flew to 
abandon atheism and embrace this belief in god .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('770')">0:12:50</a> so i think this is a great story , a great story 
of a man who had the courage to admit that he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('776')">0:12:56</a> was wrong . here's a man who was the world's most 
notorious atheist , he spent decades arguing against    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('782')">0:13:02</a> believers in god , ridiculing their beliefs , 
refuting them philosophically , he came to believe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> that was wrong in fact god does exist because 
the evidence he says led him to believe that .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('795')">0:13:15</a> so there we go , that's the story of 
how the world's most notorious atheist changed    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('801')">0:13:21</a> his mind and to my knowledge he never
actually converted to any other religion i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('806')">0:13:26</a> think he was warming towards the christian 
faith given his own cultural background    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('812')">0:13:32</a> but i don't think he ever converted to any 
other religion and let's hope , let's pray    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('816')">0:13:36</a> that he found a merciful god who 
accepted him into paradise . till next time
