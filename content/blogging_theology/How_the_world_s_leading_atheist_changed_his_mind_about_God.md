[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=1) in this video , I want to look at how the world's 
leading philosopher changed his mind about God .  
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=9) Professor Anthony Flew is an English philosopher ,
most notable for his work related to the  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=15) philosophy of religion . during the course of his 
career he taught at the universities of Oxford ,   
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=20) Aberdeen (Scotland) , Keel , Reading and at York university 
in Toronto . for much of his career , Anthony Flew  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=27) was known as a strong advocate of atheism arguing 
that one should presuppose atheism until empirical  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=35) evidence of a god surfaces . he also criticized the 
idea of life after death , the free will defense to    
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=43) the problem of evil and the meaningfulness of 
the concept of god . however in 2004 , he changed    
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=51) his position , he changed his mind and stated 
that he now believed in the existence of an    
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=58) intelligent creator of the universe . shocking 
his colleagues and fellow atheists . in order    
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=65) to further clarify his personal concept of god ,
Anthony Flew openly made an allegiance to deism    
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=72) more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian god 
which he will define in his book in a second . and    
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=79) dismissed on many occasions any call to convert 
to christianity , islam or any other religion .  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=86) he stated that in keeping with his lifelong 
commitment to go wherever the evidence leads .  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=92) he now believed in the existence of a god . i just 
want to quote some passages from his last book   
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=100) "THERE IS NO GOD" where the N has been crossed 
off gotten "THERE IS A GOD : how the world's most    
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=107) notorious atheist changed his mind" by Anthony Flew .
and I've read all this book and I wanted to  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=113) quote some of the juicier passages from it . in 
chapter four entitled "a pilgrimage of reason"    
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=120) he writes : let us begin with a parable , imagine 
that a satellite phone is washed ashore on a    
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=128) remote island inhabited by a tribe that has never 
had contact with modern civilization . the natives    
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=136) play with the numbers on the dial pad and hear 
different voices upon hitting certain sequences .  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=143) they assume first that it's the device that 
makes these noises , some of the cleverer    
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=149) natives , the scientists of the tribe assemble 
an exact replica and hit the numbers again .  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=157) they hear the voices again , the conclusion 
seems obvious to them . this  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=163) particular combination of crystals and metals 
and chemicals produce what seems like human    
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=169) voices and this means that the voices are simply 
properties of the device . but the tribal sage    
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=178) (by sage Flew probably means a philosopher) a tribal 
sage summons the scientists for a discussion .  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=185) he has thought long and hard on the matter 
and has reached the following conclusion :   
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=190) the voices coming through the instrument must 
be coming from people like themselves , people  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=197) who are living and conscious although speaking in 
a different language . instead of assuming that the  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=204) voices are simply properties of the handset , they 
should investigate the possibility that through    
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=210) some mysterious communication network they 
are in touch with other humans . perhaps further    
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=216) study along these lines could lead to a greater 
understanding of the world beyond their island .  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=223) but the scientists simply laugh at the 
sage and say , look when we damage the    
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=229) instrument the voices stop coming , so they're 
obviously nothing more than sounds produced by  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=236) a unique combination of lithium and printed 
circuit boards and light and missing diodes .  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=244) and a parable . in this parable we see how 
easy it is to let preconceived theories    
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=252) shape the way we view evidence ,
instead of letting the evidence    
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=256) shape our theories . a copernican leap may thus 
be prevented by a thousand ptolemaic epicycles .  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=266) defenders of ptolemy's geocentric model of the 
solar system resisted copernicus's heliocentric    
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=273) model by using the concept of epicycles to 
explain away observations of planetary motion that    
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=281) conflicted with their model . and in this it seems 
to me lies the peculiar danger , the endemic evil    
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=290) of dogmatic atheism . (remember Anthony Flew was himself 
a dogmatic atheist) . take such utterances as quote :  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=299) we should not ask for an explanation of how it is 
that the world exists , it is here and that's all . or :   
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=307) since we cannot accept a transcendent source 
of life , we choose to believe the impossible    
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=315) that life arose spontaneously by chance 
for matter . or : the laws of physics    
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=323) are lawless laws that arise from the void , end of 
discussion . these quotes look at first sight like   
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=331) rational arguments that have a special 
authority because they have a no-nonsense    
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=337) air about them . of course this is no more sign 
that they are either rational or arguments .  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=347) and then the next quote : as for my new position 
on the classical philosophical debates    
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=355) about god , in this area i was persuaded above 
all by the philosopher David Conway's argument   
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=362) for god's existence in his book "The Recovery of 
Wisdom : From Here to Antiquity in Quest of Sophia"  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=370) Conway is a distinguished British Philosopher 
at Middlesex University , who is equally at home   
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=375) with classical and modern philosophy . the god whose 
existence is defended by Conway and myself (writes  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=383) Flew) is the god of aristotle .Conway writes : in sum ,
to the Being  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=393) whom he considered to be the explanation of the 
world and its broad form , Aristotle ascribed the  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=401) following attributes : immutability , immateriality , 
omnipotence , omniscience , oneness or indivisibility ,  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=410) perfect goodness and necessary existence . there is 
an impressive correspondence between this set of   
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=418) attributes and those traditionally ascribed 
to god within the judeo-christian tradition ,  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=424) it is one that fully justifies us in 
viewing Aristotle as having had the same divine  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=431) being in mind as the cause of the world that is 
the object of worship of these two religions . end  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=438) quote . for some reason Flew doesn't even think about 
Islam but obviously this applies to Islam as well .  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=444) so that clarifies Flew's own concept 
of god that he embraced after leaving atheism .  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=453) and now some of the reasons , the scientific reasons 
why he began to embrace theism or belief in god  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=460) and he quotes Paul Davis the famous 
astrophysicist : Paul Davis highlights the  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=465) same problem he writes . he observes that most 
theories of biogenesis (biogenesis is the idea  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=473) of life just coming about , apparently out 
of nowhere) most theories of biogenesis  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=478) have concentrated on the chemistry of life . but 
life is more than just complex chemical reactions .  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=486) the cell also is an information storing processing 
and replicating system . we need to explain the  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=495) origin of this system , of this information and the 
way in which the information processing machinery  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=502) came to exist . he emphasizes the fact that the 
gene is nothing but a set of coded instructions  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=510) with a precise recipe for manufacturing proteins .
most important these genetic instructions are  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=518) not the kind of information you find in 
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=523) rather they constitute semantic information .
in other words , they have a specific meaning .  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=532) these instructions can be effective only in a 
molecular environment capable of interpreting the  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=539) meaning in the genetic code . the origin question 
of biogenesis rises to the top at this point ,  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=548) the problem of how meaningful or semantic 
information can emerge spontaneously from a  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=554) collection of mindless molecules subject to 
blind and purposeless forces present a deep    
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=561) conceptual challenge . there's the end of that quote . 
so you can see some of the reasons why Flew in the  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=569) light of modern science abandoned atheism . and 
the last quote here because there are so many .  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=579) is again to do with the origin of life , 
so how do we account for the origin of life  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=583) (professor Flew asks) the nobel prize winning 
physiologist George Wald  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=592) once famously argued that we choose to believe the 
impossible that life arose spontaneously by chance .  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=601) now of course this is what Flew himself 
believed , this is what atheists believe .  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=606) this Noble prize winning scientist says : in later 
years however , he concluded that a pre-existing    
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=613) mind which he posits as the matrix of physical 
reality compose the physical universe that breeds  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=620) life.  then he quotes the nobel
prize-winning professor    
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=628) who says as follows : how is it that 
with so many other apparent options  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=635) we are in a universe that possesses just that 
peculiar nexus or properties that breeds life .  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=643) it has occurred to me lately i must confess with 
some shock at first to my scientific sensibilities  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=650) that both questions might be brought 
into some degree of congruence .  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=655) this is with the assumption that mind rather than 
emerging as a late outgrowth in the evolution of  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=662) life has existed always as the matrix the 
source and condition of physical reality    
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=671) that the stuff of which physical reality is 
constructed is mind stuff . it is mind that has  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=679) composed a physical universe that breeds life . so 
eventually evolves creatures that know and create  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=688) science , art , technology making creatures .
that's the end quote there . and then Flew says :  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=695) this too is my conclusion , the only 
satisfactory explanation for the origin of such    
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=702) end directing self-replicating life as we 
see on earth is an infinitely intelligent    
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=709) Mind (with a capital M) . and of 
course we call that mind "God" .  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=717) so there we go , that's the book . it's 
very interesting his arguments are based he says    
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=724) his whole position has not really changed , he 
only goes where the evidence leads so he says    
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=730) that in his earlier career he didn't see any 
good evidence for the existence of god he says    
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=735) but now with the advent of the discovery of DNA 
and the role of genes and producing proteins and  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=742) this the semantic nature of genes 
requiring a meaningful understanding of the    
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=749) whole process of producing genes and life .  
this goes way beyond atheism and this suggests  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=755) intelligence , it suggests mind and thus it's just 
God not just the DNA but a whole host of other   
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=762) scientific discoveries lead professor Flew to 
abandon atheism and embrace this belief in god .  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=770) so i think this is a great story , a great story 
of a man who had the courage to admit that he  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=776) was wrong . here's a man who was the world's most 
notorious atheist , he spent decades arguing against    
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=782) believers in god , ridiculing their beliefs , 
refuting them philosophically , he came to believe    
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=788) that was wrong in fact god does exist because 
the evidence he says led him to believe that .  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=795) so there we go , that's the story of 
how the world's most notorious atheist changed    
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=801) his mind and to my knowledge he never
actually converted to any other religion i    
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=806) think he was warming towards the christian 
faith given his own cultural background    
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=812) but i don't think he ever converted to any 
other religion and let's hope , let's pray    
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/Gc-3QVEkfbM?t=816) that he found a merciful god who 
accepted him into paradise . till next time
