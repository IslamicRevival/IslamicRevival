 discusses the Satanic Verses controversy, and argues that the story is unlikely to be historical because it clashes with reason and logic. Additionally, it argues that the story serves a hermeneutical purpose by providing justification for intra-quranic or abrogation.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The Satanic Verses are a phrase coined by Scottish orientalist William Muir and Muslim scholars to refer to a story in the Qur'an in which a prophet is accused of compromising with pagan idolaters. Christian apologists assert that the story must be true because it fulfills the criterion of embarrassment. Imam al-Razi rejects the story on historical and literary grounds.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>* argues that the verses in deuteronomy 18 that discuss the coming of a "holy prophet" are most likely referring to Muhammad. He provides several reasons why this is the case, including the style and context of the verses, the lack of any similar verses in the Quran, and the lack of any historical or literary evidence that the verses in deuteronomy 18 were spoken by Moses.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>**  provides an introduction to the controversial book, "The Satanic Verses," by discussing the history and interpretation of the verses. Dr. Ali Ataie, a lecturer at Yale University, and Dr. Shabir Akhtar, an academic at Oxford University, discuss the implications of the verses and how they could be used to argue for secularism and free speech.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">0:00:00</a> now now maybe maybe i'll mention this as a as a 
last point um there there's there's one popular    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10')">0:00:10</a> christian contention that i think i should 
probably respond to um because christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('15')">0:00:15</a> christian apologists are always bringing 
this up um so so christian apologists contend    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('21')">0:00:21</a> that the prophet like moses okay um cannot be 
the prophet muhammad peace be upon him because    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('28')">0:00:28</a> the prophet apparently violates deuteronomy 18 
20. okay so so just as i said that the christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('36')">0:00:36</a> jesus the christian jesus violates deuteronomy 18 
16 christian apologists will tell me the prophet    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('42')">0:00:42</a> muhammad peace be upon him violates deuteronomy 
18 20. so what does deuteronomy 18 20 say    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('49')">0:00:49</a> it says but the prophet who presumes to speak a 
word in my name which i have not commanded him or    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('56')">0:00:56</a> who speaks in the name of other gods that prophet 
shall die okay so what are they talking about with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('63')">0:01:03</a> this verse they're talking about the story of the 
satanic verses right of course this was a phrase    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('69')">0:01:09</a> that was coined by you know scottish orientalist 
william muir muslim scholars refer to it as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('76')">0:01:16</a> something like that but but as you know christian 
christian apologists they love this story    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('83')">0:01:23</a> right they think it's the greatest thing since the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('86')">0:01:26</a> oceans right they think it's the greatest thing 
since sliced sliced bread at holy communion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('95')">0:01:35</a> so as as the story goes and there and there are 
multiple contradictory versions of this story    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('101')">0:01:41</a> yeah you know when when the prophet was in necca 
he was reciting surah to najam and he recited  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> have you not seen these three allat and menat    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> these were considered to be goddesses among the 
the pagans and then satan apparently whispered    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('120')">0:02:00</a> two false verses to the prophet which 
he thought were divine revelation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('131')">0:02:11</a> eventually the prophet the muslims 
and all of the idolaters prostrated    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('136')">0:02:16</a> word then spread that the prophet had compromised 
with the idolaters and everything just sort of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('142')">0:02:22</a> got along but then gabriel informed the prophet 
and those verses were removed from the quran so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('149')">0:02:29</a> that's sort of the basic story now christians they 
point out that this story of the satanic verses    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('155')">0:02:35</a> it must be true because it fulfills the criterion 
of embarrassment right they say why would a muslim    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> invent the story why would a muslim invent a 
story that embarrasses the prophet it must be true    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('168')">0:02:48</a> so i personally agree with imam al-razi about this 
story okay so imam al-razi he said that this story    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('175')">0:02:55</a> not only clashes with the quran and 
the sunnah but also clashes with reason    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('182')">0:03:02</a> carl ernst uh who wrote a book called how to read 
the quran he's professor of islamic studies at    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187')">0:03:07</a> chapel hill he also rejects this story on strictly 
historical and literary grounds he's not a very    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('194')">0:03:14</a> flimsy basis for the history yeah but but here's 
here's here's my uh here's my response uh first    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('200')">0:03:20</a> of all the the criterion of embarrassment is the 
weakest of the criteria of modern historiography    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('207')">0:03:27</a> so we shouldn't really over emphasize it and i 
know that uh jonathan brown as you pointed out    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('213')">0:03:33</a> uh makes that point in one of your videos um uh he 
makes that point in his in his introductory book    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('220')">0:03:40</a> about the prophet peace be upon him now why would 
a muslim make the muslims fabricated hundreds and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('226')">0:03:46</a> hundreds of hadith okay ibn new jersey he actually 
collected he has a book called kitabul moduaat    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('233')">0:03:53</a> right the book of fabricated hadith who fabricated 
these hadith jews christians no muslims muslims in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('242')">0:04:02</a> the past foisted lies upon the prophet this is 
a fact it's a sad fact but it's a fact why did    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('248')">0:04:08</a> they do this for various reasons people wanted 
to justify their own theological or political    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('254')">0:04:14</a> positions people wanted to justify their immoral 
behavior for selfish reasons muslims in positions    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('260')">0:04:20</a> of power wanted to keep their power at all costs 
power corrupts you know people had weak faith or    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('267')">0:04:27</a> no faith there have always been hypocrites muslims 
fabricated hadith that made the prophet look bad    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('274')">0:04:34</a> they made him look like a racist at least 
they tried to do that they did this for their    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('278')">0:04:38</a> own selfish reasons they wanted to justify their 
practice of chattel slavery for instance i mean we    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('285')">0:04:45</a> can flip the tables on the christian here or ask 
a christian who wrote the infancy gospel of thomas    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('291')">0:04:51</a> and they'll say heretics well what was their 
religion they were christian why did the christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('297')">0:04:57</a> authors of the infancy gospel of thomas write 
that jesus as a child killed another child    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('305')">0:05:05</a> and then murdered one of his teachers according 
to the criterion of embarrassment this must be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('311')">0:05:11</a> true i mean why would a christian invent the 
story right so i think they would get the point    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('317')">0:05:17</a> but but but secondly in the eyes of the people 
who actually fabricated this particular story    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('323')">0:05:23</a> did it really make the prophet look bad was 
it really embarrassing in their eyes exactly    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('329')">0:05:29</a> maybe not i personally don't have a problem 
with one or the other but i don't think    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('333')">0:05:33</a> it's historical because i understand it's 
flimsy but what it shows is that god through    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338')">0:05:38</a> through the angel gabriel protected the 
prophet from satan's satanic attack um    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('345')">0:05:45</a> so it actually confirms uh the authenticity 
of his mission because he was protected    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('349')">0:05:49</a> from satan so for me it's not a problem either 
way only if you did it in a tendentious way to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('355')">0:05:55</a> make a political point yeah is the problem 
but there's another way of looking at it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('360')">0:06:00</a> and to see it actually as a confirmation of 
the prophethood because gabriel intervened and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('367')">0:06:07</a> yeah and that's that's iben tamiya's position 
and it's in it's a respectable position right    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('373')">0:06:13</a> so yeah on the contrary maybe for 
the people who invented the story    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('377')">0:06:17</a> the story demonstrated that god rescued the 
prophet and the believers from the vile of    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('382')">0:06:22</a> from the viles of the devil and the story also had 
an exegetical purpose i mean it explained chapter    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('388')">0:06:28</a> 22 verse 52 of the quran this idea that you know 
god cancels out what satan throws in so there were    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('395')">0:06:35</a> strong theological motivations for fabricating 
the story it provided a subabu nuzu for 2252    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> as well as justified this type of intra-quranic 
or abrogation so it served a hermeneutical purpose    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('411')">0:06:51</a> so but one might ask okay what does 2252 mean then 
when it says god cancels out what satan throws in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418')">0:06:58</a> was it what is it referring to if not the satanic 
versus incident well according to imam arazi    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> this just means that the prophets are human 
beings they're not angels they have emotions    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('430')">0:07:10</a> and that they're not impervious to temptation yet 
with god's help they're able to overcome their    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('436')">0:07:16</a> temptations so nash in this verse is used in the 
linguistic sense of removing or wiping something    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> away not in the technical sense of a verse 
abrogating another verse but even with this said    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('450')">0:07:30</a> the story doesn't make historical sense it clashes 
with reason and logic for one thing it says that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455')">0:07:35</a> 2252 abrogated the so-called satanic verses this 
is very strange why is it strange a bit ridiculous    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('464')">0:07:44</a> because 2252 was revealed in medina many years 
later so were the muslims praying to alat and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('472')">0:07:52</a> el uzza and manat for many years these false 
verses were being recited by the prophet and    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('477')">0:07:57</a> the companions for eight years of course not 
this is nonsense secondly and dr shabir ali    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> as well as some of the study quran commentators 
point this out that if the prophet said that it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> that it was okay to pray to these goddesses that 
that would have been the end of his prophetic    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('496')">0:08:16</a> career i mean he would have lost all credibility 
in in the eyes of both his followers and enemies    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('504')">0:08:24</a> and we can actually i think demonstrate uh what 
the fabricator of the story did he took the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('509')">0:08:29</a> historical kernel of this story and he altered 
it in order to give the appearance of truth    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('515')">0:08:35</a> so there is a hadith in bukhari that says the 
prophet recited surah najam and then he prostrated    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('521')">0:08:41</a> and the muslims prostrated and the idolaters 
prostrated but it says nothing about satan or    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('528')">0:08:48</a> satanic verses or you know these are the high 
flying cranes whose intercession is to be sought    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('534')">0:08:54</a> it just says everyone prostrated okay so the 
obvious subtext is that the idolaters were    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('539')">0:08:59</a> overcome with awe at the beauty of the prophet's 
recitation and so they prostrated when the prophet    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> did that's it but what about what about textual 
criticism right so were these verses really part    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('554')">0:09:14</a> of the quran so so textual critics look at both 
external and internal evidence and i'll just give    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('561')">0:09:21</a> you a quick example from the new testament luke 
22 44 okay it says and being in agony he meaning    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('569')">0:09:29</a> jesus prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as 
if great drops of blood falling down on the ground    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('578')">0:09:38</a> when we look at the external evidence that is 
the manuscript evidence the manuscript witnesses    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> for this verse we notice that the earliest 
manuscripts of luke do not contain this verse p69    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('592')">0:09:52</a> p75 they don't contain this verse okay internal 
evidence looks at both the christology of luke as    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">0:10:00</a> well as luke's style and choice of words okay the 
luke in jesus is basically a stoic philosopher i    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('607')">0:10:07</a> mean he's always in control of his emotions aaron 
calls him imperturbable right he can't be bothered    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('615')">0:10:15</a> by anything even on on route to the crucifixion 
he's having this lucid conversation with    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('621')">0:10:21</a> with women you know don't weep for me weep for 
yourselves there's no cry of dereliction in the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('625')">0:10:25</a> gospel of luke there isn't no father my god my 
god why hast thou forsaken me it's not there right    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('633')">0:10:33</a> even though luke had market mark in front of him 
and luke you know father into your hands i commend    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('639')">0:10:39</a> my spirit he's always in control so luke 22 44 
conflicts with the luke and jesus's personality    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('648')">0:10:48</a> that's one thing secondly this verse interrupts 
a chiasm in the compositional structure of luke's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> narrative which is really interesting thirdly 
this verse contains multiple hypox leguminoids    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> like words that do not appear anywhere else 
in luke's gospel so that's a good indicator    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('668')">0:11:08</a> of a second hand writing these verses okay so 
both external and internal evidence support the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674')">0:11:14</a> exclusion of this verse and fourthly i'll add 
this verse served a specific theological purpose    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> luke's gospel was beloved to the gnostics 
like marcion many of whom did not believe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('688')">0:11:28</a> that jesus had a an actual physical body so this 
verse was added by the proto-orthodox to prove    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> that jesus did have a physical body he's sweating 
blood right now just just interrupt their second    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('701')">0:11:41</a> uh bar ehrman has written uh a scholarly work 
called the orthodox corruption of scripture    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('706')">0:11:46</a> it's an investigation into the uh the 
inscribable alterations that were made to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('711')">0:11:51</a> the uh the manuscript tradition and the particular 
example you mentioned is certainly discussed in in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('716')">0:11:56</a> detail and with that very points if readers want 
to uh explore this further i do recommend bar    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('722')">0:12:02</a> it's called the orthodox corruption of scripture 
it gives many examples of where later christian    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('727')">0:12:07</a> scribes have altered the text of the new testament 
um and we can show this either to further a more    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('733')">0:12:13</a> so-called orthodox theology or other agendas 
or adoptionist or patriotist or whatever so    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('739')">0:12:19</a> the text has constantly been fought over by 
different scribes throughout the century so we're    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('743')">0:12:23</a> altering it and changing it again and again and 
again yeah but but you're right this is this is    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('748')">0:12:28</a> a good example that urban also brings up yeah but 
now if we if we apply yeah and that's an excellent    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('753')">0:12:33</a> book the orthodox corruption scripture and if 
that proves to be too robust then he did like    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('758')">0:12:38</a> a simpler sort of dummies version of it called um 
misquoting jesus sure yeah he's an academic worker    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('765')">0:12:45</a> he's i think meant for other scholars but it's 
readable you're right he did a more popular work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('774')">0:12:54</a> yeah so so what if we applied then uh textual 
criticism to the satanic verses like i just    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('781')">0:13:01</a> did to the gospel of luke and i'll end with this 
with respect to external evidence there are zero    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> manuscripts of the quran that contain these verses 
the satanic verses you can count them on no hands    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('794')">0:13:14</a> there are zero pirate of the quran that contain 
these verses so these verses get an f they fail    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('802')">0:13:22</a> miserably when it comes to external evidence 
bruce metzger would give them an f what what about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('808')">0:13:28</a> internal evidence do these verses agree with the 
style and context and choice of words and message    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('814')">0:13:34</a> of the quran absolutely not there is nothing 
more antithetical to the message of the quran    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('820')">0:13:40</a> than these verses also the there are certain 
words in these like that's a hypoxalagaminan very    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('827')">0:13:47</a> strange world word you know these cranes you have 
this like form eight passive verb which is very    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('836')">0:13:56</a> strange also a hypox lagamnon so this is clearly 
not the author of the quran so these verses    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('842')">0:14:02</a> fail when it comes to internal evidence as well so 
the final verdict is that the satanic versus story    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('848')">0:14:08</a> from a historical and literary perspective does 
not pass whatsoever the prophet peace be upon him    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('856')">0:14:16</a> never spoke in the name of other gods he never 
said anything that god did not command him to say    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('861')">0:14:21</a> and ironically in the very same surah 
how does the surah begin surah allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('872')">0:14:32</a> the prophet never speaks from 
his caprice from his desires  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('880')">0:14:40</a> everything that he says is revelation allamahu    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('884')">0:14:44</a> he is taught by one mighty in power okay 
so my final conclusion would be that    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('891')">0:14:51</a> uh that the best candidate for for deuteronomy 
18 18 is the holy prophet muhammad sallam and

guess what the satanic verses but not the one    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('974')">0:16:14</a> not the ones that we're talking about the uh the 
notorious uh so-called novel by salman rushdie the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('981')">0:16:21</a> bushes writer and uh dr um akhtar will be talking 
about um secularism freedom of speech um and the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('990')">0:16:30</a> way that muhammad that the man is is uh uh seen 
as a you know you can insult him and degrade him    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('997')">0:16:37</a> in the name of free speech and the implications 
of this satanic verse is novel uh in uk    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1004')">0:16:44</a> um literary history and i know this perhaps

outstanding um introduction to these issues    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1029')">0:17:09</a> such a um a polygon yeah certainly who is a person 
who can uh operate on so many different registers    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1036')">0:17:16</a> linguistically and through various ancient 
texts the bible the quran and so on and there's    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1042')">0:17:22</a> it's a real tree to have this kind of holistic 
synthesized um exposition of the issues rather    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1048')">0:17:28</a> than someone is narrowly focused on just one 
field you you're clearly an expert on many fields    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1054')">0:17:34</a> and it's that kind of multidisciplinary approach 
we really need when we're talking with christians    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1059')">0:17:39</a> and jews and muslims together about all these 
texts so um outstanding um uh work there thank

i think it's a very strong candidate myself for um    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1094')">0:18:14</a> uh the prophet uh of islam and put it that
