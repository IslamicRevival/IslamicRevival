'It is God who created you from dust and later from a drop of fluid; then He made you into two sexes; no female conceives or gives birth without His knowledge; no person grows old or has his life cut short, except in accordance with a Record: all this is easy for God.' Qur'an 35:11

A new study has found that the aging process is indeed unstoppable, with mortality rates increasing as people get older. This confirms what many have long suspected and provides further evidence that it is biological factors, rather than environmental ones, that control lifespan.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhwWGm7qzRc&t=0)** This article reports on an unprecedented study that confirms that the aging process is unstoppable. The study found that mortality rates at younger ages have declined, but that as people get older, the risk of death increases. Professor Alberto from Oxford's Center for Demographic Science said that this suggests that biological rather than environmental factors control lifespan.

[0:00:01](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=1) The aging process is unstoppable finds an 
unprecedented study reported in today's Guardian.    
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=8) The article says 'immortality and everlasting youth 
are the stuff of myths' according to new research    
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=15) which may finally end the eternal debate about 
whether we can live forever backed by governments    
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=22) business academics and investors in an industry 
worth an estimated 110 billion dollars scientists    
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=28) have spent decades attempting to harness the 
power of genomics and artificial intelligence    
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=34) to find a way to prevent or even reverse aging 
but an unprecedented study has now confirmed    
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=42) that we probably cannot slow the rate at which 
we get older because of biological constraints    
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=48) although the quran has a a different take 
which i'll mention in a minute the study by    
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=53) an international uh team of scientists from 14 
countries including experts from oxford set out    
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=59) to test the invariant rate of aging hypothesis 
which says that a species has a relatively fixed    
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=67) rate of aging from adulthood quote our findings 
support the theory that rather than slowing down    
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=74) death more people are living much longer 
due to a reduction in mortality at younger    
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=80) ages said professor alberto from oxford's center 
for demographic science who analyzed age-specific    
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=88) birth and death data spanning centuries and 
continents he said we compared birth and death    
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=96) data from humans and non-human primates and found 
this general pattern of mortality was the same in    
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=104) all of them this suggests that biological rather 
than environmental factors ultimately control    
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=111) longevity he said the statistics confirmed 
individuals live longer as health and living    
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=118) conditions improve which leads to increasing 
longevity across an entire population nevertheless    
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=125) a steep rise in death rates as years advance 
into old age is clear to see in all species    
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=134) but the guardian then says but what has 
been missing from the debate is research    
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=138) comparing lifespans of multiple animal populations 
with humans to work out what is driving mortality    
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=146) and this study plugs that gap says alberto from 
oxford this extraordinarily diverse collection of    
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=153) data enables us to compare mortality differences 
between both within and between species all the    
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=164) data sets examined by the teams alberta's teams 
revealed the same general pattern of mortality    
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=170) a high risk of death in infancy which rapidly 
declines in the immature and teenage years    
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=177) remains low until early adulthood and then 
continually rises in advanced advancing age    
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=185) our findings confirm that in historical 
populations meaning in the past life expectancy    
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=192) was low because many people died young but as 
medical social and environmental improvements    
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=198) continued life expectancy increased and he 
concludes more and more people live uh too much    
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=206) longer now however the trajectory towards death in 
old age has not changed well that's a perhaps not    
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=215) surprising conclusion and a reminder of a verse in 
the quran which in abdul haleem's translation goes    
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=223) it is god who created you from dust and later from 
a drop of fluid and then made you into two sexes    
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=231) no female conceives or gives birth without his 
knowledge no person grows old or has his life    
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/GhwWGm7qzRc?t=239) cut short except in accordance with a record 
all this is easy for god until next time
