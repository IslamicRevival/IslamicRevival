The resurrection of Jesus is a central tenet of Christianity, but according to Professor Giza Vermes, it is not something that Jesus himself taught. Vermes argues that the concept of resurrection was initially promoted by the Pharisees, and that it is rarely mentioned in first-century tomb inscriptions. He also points out that the disciples' disbelief at Jesus' resurrection is in line with what would be expected if these prophecies did not originate with Jesus himself.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxRDbYZ9-os&t=0)** The resurrection of Jesus is at the heart of the message of Christianity, and according to Professor Giza Vermes, it is not among the central tenets of the teaching of Jesus. He argues that the concept of resurrection was initially promoted by the Pharisees, another group of people frequently mentioned in negative terms in the Gospels. He also points out that resurrection is rarely mentioned on tomb inscriptions from the first century. Turning to the Gospels, Professor Vermes argues that resurrection is not among the central tenets of the teaching of Jesus, who was more concerned with eternal life than with the revival of dry bones. One may also put a question mark to his repeated annunciations of his death and resurrection.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxRDbYZ9-os&t=300)** Christianity believes that Jesus will return to earth and be resurrected. Luke's gospel tells the story of how some of Jesus' disciples found his body missing from the tomb, and then later saw him alive after he had risen from the dead. Gizavermesh points out that the disciples' disbelief at Jesus' resurrection is in line with what would be expected if these prophecies did not originate with Jesus himself, but were instead added later by apostles who were reminded of what Jesus had said to them.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxRDbYZ9-os&t=600)** The Resurrection is a Christian belief that believes Jesus rose from the dead. There are two types of evidence for the Resurrection: first, eyewitness accounts, and second, the apparitions of Jesus to his apostles. Neither of these types of evidence fares well when compared to other religions.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxRDbYZ9-os&t=900)** Jerusalem prophet Giza Vermish concludes that four possible rational explanations exist for how the resurrection of Jesus could have happened: the body was not found by the women, the tomb was wrong, the apostles stole the body, or he was buried alive and later woke up. Though this modern concoction of the novel and film The Da Vinci Code is unsupported by ancient evidence, the transformation of the apostles--a phenomenon that occurred due to the inward experience of the spirit--may lead us out of this maze.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxRDbYZ9-os&t=1200)** Giza Vermish discusses the resurrection according to the Dead Sea Scrolls. He recommends reading a book on the subject if interested in learning more about Jesus Christ. Christianity has transformed the message of Jesus into a different religion, which is known today as Christianity.

[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=15) heart of the message of christianity  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=19) what are we to make of this  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=20) extraordinary claim and i want to share  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=22) with you some words from giza vermesh  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=24) again he's a world-class biblical  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=27) scholar often acknowledged as one of the  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=29) great and experts on the historical  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=32) jesus he spent his life studying uh  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=35) these matters a professor at oxford  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=37) university a professor of jewish studies  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=40) so he's a specialist in a jewish  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=41) understanding of jesus who was himself  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=43) of course a jew who preached two jews  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=46) about his understanding of judaism in  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=48) his own day so it's going to share with  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=50) you a few words about the resurrection  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=53) because there are many insights into  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=55) this brief uh chapter which  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=58) will surprise people surprised me when i  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=60) first read them  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=62) so he writes on page 107 of his book the  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=65) real jesus  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=66) the resurrection of jesus lies at the  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=69) heart of the message of christianity  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=72) the chief herald of this message saint  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=74) paul  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=75) bluntly proclaims  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=77) if christ has not been raised your faith  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=81) is futile  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=82) so it's very very clear if there's no  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=84) resurrection of jesus that's it  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=86) christianity is basically lying about  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=89) god is a waste of time  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=91) but he believed he did rise from the  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=93) dead so how does his firm statement  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=97) reinforced by two millennia of  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=99) theological cognition  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=101) compared with what the gospels tell us  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=104) about the first easter  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=106) is it pure myth  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=108) or does it contain also a grain of  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=111) history  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=112) so giza vermich the historian looks at  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=114) our earliest sources or some of them in  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=117) the new testament in the gospels and  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=119) what do they tell us about this very  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=121) interesting insights here  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=123) but to begin with he looks at the  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=125) historical jewish context to begin with  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=129) resurrection was neither an old nor  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=132) widespread jewish doctrine in the age of  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=134) jesus interestingly  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=136) the concept of afterlife conceived  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=139) either as spiritual survival or as  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=142) rising from the dead first gained  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=145) prominence in the second century bc  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=149) the immortality of the soul was  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=151) championed by many jews living outside  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=153) the holy land and influenced by greek  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=156) culture as well as by the essene sect in  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=159) palestine  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=161) according to the first century jewish  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=163) historian flavius josephus  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=167) the conservative sadducees these figures  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=170) all appear in the gospels by the way the  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=171) sadducees the pharisees and so on the  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=174) conservative sadducees and the high  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=176) priestly allies  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=178) considered the idea of life after death  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=181) a departure from biblical faith  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=184) were where reward for virtue and  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=187) punishment for sin were expected in this  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=190) life  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=191) beyond the grave everybody shared the  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=194) same chilly and sleepy existence in the  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=197) hades of the hebrews and this is  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=199) normally how the old testament we have  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=201) now talks of post-mortem existence in a  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=204) very kind of gray  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=207) world where there's no kind of clear  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=209) heaven or clear  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=210) hell the principal innovators of this  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=214) idea of resurrection were the pharisees  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=216) another big group of people you see  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=218) frequently mentioned in very negative  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=220) terms in the gospels  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=222) they promoted the doctrine of  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=224) resurrection among urban jury  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=227) but the bulk of the rural population was  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=230) mostly confused  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=231) resurrection rarely figures on tomb  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=234) inscriptions now this is amazing i had  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=237) no idea about this until i read that  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=239) sentence that if you look at first  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=241) century jewish palestinian palestinian  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=244) gravestones tomb inscriptions  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=247) you rarely ever find any reference to  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=249) the resurrection interesting  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=252) turning to the gospels resurrection is  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=255) not among the central tenets of the  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=257) teaching of jesus what  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=260) resurrection is not among the central  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=262) tenets of the teaching of jesus he was  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=264) more concerned with eternal life than  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=267) with the revival of dry bones if you  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=270) read the gospels this actually is true  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=272) one may also put a question mark to his  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=275) repeated annunciations of his death and  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=278) resurrection now i'm going to pause  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=280) there and i'm going to go to almost a  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=282) random example in my new revised  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=285) standard version bible  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=287) repeatedly in the gospels  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=289) jesus  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=291) forecasts predicts his death and  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=294) resurrection in some detail this is  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=296) really important so for example in luke  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=298) 18 he says  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=300) um he took his twelve disciples aside  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=303) and said to them  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=305) that everything that is written about  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=306) the son of man  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=308) by the prophets will be accomplished for  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=310) he will be handed over to the gentiles  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=313) and he will be mocked and insulted and  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=316) spat upon  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=317) and after they have flocked him they  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=320) will kill him  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=321) and on the third day he will rise again  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=325) so these are very specific predictions  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=327) about someone called the son of man  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=330) and the the jesus as portrayed in luke  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=332) claims that this is all discussed or  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=335) foretold in great detail  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=337) in the prophets in the jewish bible  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=339) although personally i've never quite  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=341) come across any passages that say that  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=343) but be that as it may  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=345) so to come back to giza vermesh  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=348) so he rightly says  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=350) one may also put a question mark to his  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=353) repeated announcements of his death and  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=355) resurrection why  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=357) the fact that all his disciples  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=359) abandoned him when he was arrested and  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=363) no one expected his rising no one  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=366) expected it according to the gospels  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=368) suggests that these prophecies did not  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=371) originate with jesus but were added  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=374) later  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=376) we find no apostle comforting himself on  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=379) good friday saying let's wait three days  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=382) and all will be well  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=384) because you would logically think  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=385) wouldn't you if they had been drilled  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=387) with this idea that the messiah would  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=390) die  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=390) and be scourged and be spat upon and  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=393) crucified by the romans the gentiles and  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=396) on the third day he will rise from the  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=399) dead  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=400) well of course they're going to think  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=401) well yep it's happening it's happening  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=403) now just as jesus told us indeed let's  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=405) just wait three days and all will be  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=408) well  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=410) but that's not what happens if you look  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=411) again this is me digressing now if you  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=414) look at luke's gospel for example  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=418) in matthew sorry luke 24  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=421) on the first day of the week  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=423) some of the women go to the tomb  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=425) taking spices they had prepared  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=428) and they found the stone rolled away it  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=431) says and  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=432) someone perhaps  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=434) angels two men with dazzling clothes  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=437) stood beside them the women were  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=439) terrified because they weren't expecting  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=442) this  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=443) and the angels or the men uh say why are  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=446) you looking for uh for this person  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=448) amongst the dead he is not here he is  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=451) risen  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=453) um and then there and then these angels  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=455) or these figures refer to the uh  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=457) predictions  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=458) which i've already mentioned one of them  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=461) so they it says here they ran from the  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=464) tomb this is the women ran from the tomb  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=466) and told this to the eleven that these  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=468) are the apostles  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=470) and this was mary magdalene  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=473) and the other women who told this to the  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=475) apostles that's verse 10  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=478) and look what the response is in verse  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=480) 11  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=481) but these words seem to them the  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=484) apostles an idle tale  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=486) and they did not believe them  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=488) and idle tell by the way an alternative  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=490) translation of the greek is nonsense  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=493) but in one word so the apostles having  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=496) been told reminded precisely what jesus  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=500) had told them repeatedly in great detail  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=502) when it actually happens  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=504) when the news is conveyed to them  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=508) they did not believe them quote unquote  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=511) and it these words seem to them an idle  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=514) tale that's how the nrsv  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=517) translates it  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=519) why why is it an idle tale why have they  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=522) no idea  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=524) no idea about this  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=526) you would expect them historically let's  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=529) wait three days and all will be well you  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=531) can spend to be waiting yeah yeah we  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=533) know we believe jesus words are true  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=535) because he did miracles he did signs and  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=537) wonders by the power of god  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=539) so this is something we should  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=540) reasonably expect to happen but when it  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=542) happens they don't believe it  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=545) it's nonsense so there's that's why uh  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=548) giza vermich and actually most  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=550) historians have concluded uh that this  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=553) uh these predictions did not originate  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=557) uh with jesus they were added  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=559) later these gospels of course are  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=560) written many many years after jesus life  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=564) in  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=565) the second generation of christians  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=566) towards the end of the first century  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=568) plenty of time for these stories to be  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=571) um carefully embellished  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=573) anyway  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=574) back to the story belief in the  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=576) resurrection of jesus consists in two  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=579) combined sets of stories about an empty  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=581) tomb and a series of apparitions now  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=584) this is the detail the devil's in the  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=586) detail as they say and gizavermish has  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=589) some fascinating observations i think to  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=591) make about these stories in the gospels  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=593) all four gospels report that the body of  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=596) jesus was missing from the grave when  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=599) one or several women visited it on early  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=603) on easter sunday  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=604) fair enough  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=605) the idea of resurrection comes from one  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=608) or two unknown men presumed to be angels  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=611) or dazzling clothes i mentioned that who  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=613) met the women in the tomb according to  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=615) mark matthew and luke  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=618) by contrast in john's gospel mary  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=621) magdalene suspects that jesus's remains  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=624) were removed by someone else not  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=626) connected with the apostles  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=628) she asked the unknown man standing close  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=632) by later identified as jesus where he  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=635) put the missing body  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=637) at the end the argument is seriously  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=639) weakened by the apostles rejection of  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=642) the women's report which they ridiculed  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=645) as an idle tale as we've already seen or  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=648) nonsense is a that's a another way of  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=651) translating it  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=653) the second type of evidence  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=655) the apparitions of the risen jesus to  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=657) his apostles  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=659) do not fare much better either the  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=661) oldest account we have now mark is  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=664) usually seen by virtually all scholars  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=666) now as the earliest gospel in the new  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=668) testament we have matthew first then  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=670) mark then john then luke then john but  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=672) for various reasons mark is the oldest  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=674) account and if you look at mark chapter  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=676) 16 the last chapter verses one to eight  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=680) the inauthentic verses 9 to 20 which you  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=683) will find in all bibles are missing from  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=686) the best manuscripts  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=688) so all the bibles including the nrsv  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=691) that have those verses are not actually  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=693) um reproducing or printing uh the  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=696) earliest manuscripts these are later um  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=700) stories that were added to the gospel  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=703) what is interesting he says that the  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=705) oldest account mark 16 1-8 contains no  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=710) visions at all  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=713) okay  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=715) the earliest  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=716) gospel in the new testament has no  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=719) resurrection appearances at all  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=722) interesting  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=723) according to luke and john jesus was  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=726) seen by the apostles in jerusalem on  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=729) easter sunday  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=730) and luke mentions an account and  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=732) encounter with two disciples on the same  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=735) day some miles away in emmaus i was  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=738) going to pause there because if you look  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=740) at my trusty nrsv uh go back to luke's  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=744) gospel again  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=746) and there's a famous story of the walk  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=748) to emmaus that giza vermish alludes to  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=751) and what i find interesting there's a  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=753) little detail here which is not often  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=755) focused on so these these guys uh are  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=759) two of them uh walking uh to a village  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=761) called emmaus about several miles from  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=763) jerusalem and they're talking about  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=766) everything that's happened you know with  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=768) jesus and the jerusalem authorities and  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=770) so on and they're talking about them  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=772) about this then jesus himself comes  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=775) basically near them and walks with them  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=777) or they don't know who he is  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=779) um according to verse 16 of chapter 24  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=784) uh and then the the stranger who is  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=787) revealed later to be jesus said what are  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=789) you discussing with each other while  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=790) you're walking along yeah  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=792) and they stood still it says looking sad  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=796) then um  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=798) one of them said whose name was cleopas  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=800) are you the only stranger in jerusalem  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=802) who doesn't know the things that have  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=804) taken place there in these days  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=807) he asked them what things  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=809) and then they say this is a very  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=810) interesting thing they replied this is  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=813) verse 19 the things about jesus of  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=816) nazareth who was a prophet  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=818) mighty indeed  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=820) and word before god  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=822) and all the people  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=825) interesting so here are some followers  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=828) of jesus  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=829) who  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=830) well acquainted with what's been going  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=832) on and what do they call jesus who is  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=834) jesus he is a prophet  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=838) mighty in deed and word before god so  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=842) jesus and god are two separate things  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=844) they do not say what later christian  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=847) creeds affirm that jesus was the second  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=849) person of the trinity god incarnate a  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=852) divine being or jesus is god as  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=854) christians always say that jesus god  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=856) jesus is god according to  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=859) these people who knew who you know knew  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=861) what was going on jesus was a prophet  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=864) mighty indeed what other religion says  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=866) that i wonder  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=868) so coming back to uh giza vermish  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=871) matthew now moving on to matthew's  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=873) gospel in turn places the only meeting  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=876) of jesus with 11 apostles  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=880) with 11 apostles days later on a  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=883) galilean mountain so the only time in  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=887) matthew's version the apostles meet him  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=889) is on this galilean mountain john  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=891) asserts that seven apostles saw him by  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=894) the sea of tiberias  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=896) to model the story further luke's jesus  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=899) orders his disciples not to leave  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=901) jerusalem  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=902) until pentecost pentecost is an amazing  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=906) supernatural event that happens in acts  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=908) chapter 2.  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=911) so  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=912) as for the identity of the appearing  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=915) person mary magdalene took him for the  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=918) gardener the emma's disciples for an  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=921) unknown passer-by and the jerusalem  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=923) apostles for a ghost  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=927) so no one quite agrees with who this  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=929) person is  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=930) so he concludes vermish there are four  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=933) rational ways for explaining away the  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=935) resurrection conundrum so here we have a  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=937) series of  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=938) uh very very loose ends and he offers  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=941) four theories four possible explanations  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=944) as to how to explain away this this  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=947) problem how do we understand it  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=949) rationally so the first  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=951) the body was not found by the women  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=953) because the guardian of the cemetery  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=956) used the first opportunity to move the  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=958) body of jesus out of the grave which had  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=961) been prepared for someone else  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=964) that's the first possibility second  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=966) possibility  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=967) in the darkness the women lost their way  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=969) and went to the wrong tomb  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=972) the uncertainty in both cases  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=974) could have easily had been dispelled by  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=977) consulting the owner of the tomb jesus  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=980) friend joseph of arimathea but no one  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=983) seems to have thought of it  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=986) three third possibility  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=988) the apostles stole the corpse as was  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=991) alleged by the priestly leaders  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=993) but since nobody expected jesus to rise  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=996) again  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=997) why should anyone fake his resurrection  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1000) notice no one expected him to rise  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1003) strange given the gospels are full of  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1005) predictions of precisely that event  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1007) and fourthly  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1009) this is most the most fruity one  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1011) jesus was buried alive and later woke up  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1015) to live and left to live happily for a  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1017) time if not ever after  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1019) this modern concoction  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1022) popularized by the da vinci code the  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1024) famous novel and film  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1026) is unsupported by ancient evidence  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1029) though we know that recovery from  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1031) crucifixion was possible  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1034) this is particularly gory  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1036) flavius josephus uh he's a really famous  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1039) jewish historian from jerusalem at the  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1041) time  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1043) just slightly after jesus time  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1045) he mentions that three of his friends  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1048) were taken off the cross in a.d 70 and  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1052) were attended by roman physicians and  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1054) that one of them survived  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1057) can you believe it having survived a  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1058) crucifixion  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1060) in this class of literature jesus  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1062) usually marries mary magdalene and  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1065) settles somewhere away from judea in the  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1068) south of france nice place  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1070) or in rome  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1072) but  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1072) and according to the 19th century  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1075) islamic sect  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1077) the ahmadiyya  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1078) he journeyed instead to the east in  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1081) search of the lost jewish tribes and  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1084) died in india  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1086) so take your pick  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1087) so those are the four options as giza  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1089) vermich says he concludes  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1091) with quite a extraordinary  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1094) statement  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1095) neither positive nor negative reasoning  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1098) leads anywhere because the resurrection  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1101) of jesus cannot be compared to events  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1103) belonging to history  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1105) there is however one phenomenon that may  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1108) lead us out of this maze  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1111) the transformation of the apostles  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1115) it was not due to the apparitions of  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1117) jesus says giza varmish  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1120) they remain frightened the apostles  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1122) remain frightened and continue to hide  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1125) for another seven weeks after easter  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1127) that's easter sunday  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1129) what capitulated them into action was  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1132) pentecost mentions in acts 2 the  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1135) metamorphosis achieved by the inward  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1138) experience of the spirit  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1141) miscellaneous men became spiritual  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1144) warriors  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1145) the charismatic potency imparted to them  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1148) by jesus during his ministry and the  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1151) recollection of his powerful teaching  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1154) resulted again in mighty words and deeds  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1159) they felt their master close to them he  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1162) rose in their hearts  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1164) this is the historical element in the  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1167) resurrection saga  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1170) end quote  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1172) so interesting interesting so basically  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1175) the sheer power of jesus personality his  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1179) charisma  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1181) the impact of his ministry  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1183) on their lives over several years  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1186) continued beyond  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1189) his apparent death and resurrection  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1191) shall we say but it wasn't really a  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1193) resurrection that they believed in they  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1195) believed in uh he rose in their hearts  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1199) they chose to continue his ministry  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1201) basically proclaiming the kingdom of god  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1205) now of course this is not what paul  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1206) believed it's not what the apostle paul  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1208) taught but that's a different subject  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1210) so there we go uh that's the  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1213) resurrection according to giza vermish i  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1216) do recommend this book in general if you  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1218) want to  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1219) read about  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1220) jesus the dead sea scrolls um  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1224) all sorts of things and the way the  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1225) church has  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1227) transformed the message of jesus into a  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1229) very different religion which today we  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1232) call christianity  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/IxRDbYZ9-os?t=1234) till next time
