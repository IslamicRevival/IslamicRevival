## Description

I read from 'The Triumph of Christianity: How a Forbidden Religion Swept the World' by Bart D. Ehrman https://www.amazon.co.uk/Triumph-Christianity-Forbidden-Religion-Swept/dp/1786073013

Throughout history, when Christians have pointed to “predictions of Jesus” in the Old Testament, Jews have denied the passages involve messianic prophecies. Christians have long maintained, for example, that the ancient prophet Isaiah was looking ahead to Jesus when he declared, centuries before the crucifixion: “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement for our peace was upon him, and by his wounds we were healed” (Isaiah 53: 5-6). In response, Jewish readers have pointed out that Isaiah never indicates he is referring to a messiah figure. On the contrary he speaks of someone who has ALREADY suffered, and he does not call that one the messiah. More than that, earlier in his account he explicitly indicates who this “suffering servant of the Lord” is. It is the nation of Israel itself, which has suffered because of the sins of the people (see Isaiah 49:3).

The Jews of Paul's day rejected his claim that Jesus was the promised messiah because they did not expect the messiah to suffer and be raised from the dead. However, the author mentions how there are other understandings of the messiah which are not objectionable in terms of the jewish scriptures.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1')">0:00:01</a> why did the jews of paul's day in the first 
century reject the christian claims about    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7')">0:00:07</a> Jesus being the promised Messiah ? in the book 
of acts in the new testament , we read of paul  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('13')">0:00:13</a> going to synagogue after synagogue proclaiming 
his gospel about Jesus being the Messiah and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('19')">0:00:19</a> references many texts in the jewish bible 
but the jews mostly react very negatively ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('25')">0:00:25</a> some even took up stones to stone him and they 
cast him out of their synagogues.  why is this ?  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('31')">0:00:31</a> why would the jews reject their own messiah 
when he is apparently so clearly prophesied  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('37')">0:00:37</a> in the jewish scriptures ? this is an intriguing 
question and to solve this mystery i turn to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('45')">0:00:45</a> "THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY : How a Forbidden Religion Swept the World" by Bart Ehrman . i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('51')">0:00:51</a> think it's his most recent book and he addresses 
this very question on page 47. where he writes :  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('59')">0:00:59</a> to make sense of the early jewish outrage over 
claims concerning the messiahship of Jesus ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('66')">0:01:06</a> we need to cut through many centuries of 
christian thinking , mountains of subsequent    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('71')">0:01:11</a> christian theological speculation and masses of 
christian common sense about how jesus came as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('78')">0:01:18</a> the fulfillment of scripture . many christians today 
have serious difficulty understanding how jews in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('85')">0:01:25</a> antiquity and throughout history down till today 
have rejected the claim that Jesus was the messiah .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('94')">0:01:34</a> in this traditional christian view , it is very 
simple and clear-cut . the jewish scriptures  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('100')">0:01:40</a> themselves predicted the messiah would be born 
of a virgin in Bethlehem . that he would be a great  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('106')">0:01:46</a> healer and teacher and that he would suffer 
an excruciating death for the sins of others  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> and then be raised from the dead .all that is 
in the jews own bible , why can't they see that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('120')">0:02:00</a> can't they read ? not all christians have thought 
this way of course , those who have done so have    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> been trained to read the old testament in certain 
ways to see references to a future messiah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('135')">0:02:15</a> where jews themselves have never detected any 
messianic prophecies . throughout history when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('143')">0:02:23</a> christians have pointed to predictions of jesus 
in the old testament , jews have denied the passages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('150')">0:02:30</a> involve messianic prophecies . christians have long 
maintained for example that the ancient prophet    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> Isaiah was looking ahead to Jesus when he 
declared centuries before the crucifixion ,  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('165')">0:02:45</a> he was wounded for our transgressions , he was 
bruised for our iniquities , the chastisement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('171')">0:02:51</a> that our peace was upon him and by his wounds we 
were healed . that's in isaiah 53 verses 5 to 6.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('182')">0:03:02</a> in response , jewish readers have pointed out 
that Isaiah never indicates , he is referring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('189')">0:03:09</a> to a messiah figure . on the contrary , he speaks of 
someone who has already suffered in the past tense .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> he does not call that one messiah . more than that ,
earlier in his account he explicitly indicates  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('205')">0:03:25</a> who this suffering servant of the lord is , it is 
the nation of israel itself which has suffered    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('213')">0:03:33</a> because of the sins of the people . see isaiah 49 
verse 3. so if i go to my bible and look at isaiah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223')">0:03:43</a> 49 verse 3 it says : and he said to me you are my 
servant israel in whom i will be glorified you are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234')">0:03:54</a> my servant israel . so the sermon in this passage 
now isaiah 49 50 51 52 53 all part of the same    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('241')">0:04:01</a> narrative , the same dialogue if you like the 
same story the four servant songs of israel .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('248')">0:04:08</a> and so this is clearly identifying the servant 
as israel itself . but Ehrman continues : in the days  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('257')">0:04:17</a> of paul among jews who had expectations of 
what the messiah would be , there was never    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('264')">0:04:24</a> an expectation that the messiah would suffer for 
the sins of others and then be raged from the dead .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('271')">0:04:31</a> in fact , the expectations were quite the 
opposite . that's the end quote from Bart Ehrman .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('278')">0:04:38</a> and i would go further than this and i would 
say if you look at all the jewish prophets in    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('283')">0:04:43</a> the jewish bible whether it be Moses or Jeremiah ,
Isaiah , Micah , Hosea etc never do they mention    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> that the messiah would be Yahweh , would be god 
incarnate come to earth it never says that ever   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> which is peculiar if this was so central to the 
salvation of the world . do you think the prophets    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('304')">0:05:04</a> would actually mention this amazing fact . the 
other thing they don't mention (as far as i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> aware and i have read the jewish bible cover to 
cover many times) no jewish prophet Moses , Jeremiah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('319')">0:05:19</a> Micah , Isaiah , all the great prophets not a single 
one ever says that god was three persons in one    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326')">0:05:26</a> god . they never say that god is the father , the son 
and the holy spirit . three persons each fully god .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('334')">0:05:34</a> but in some mysterious way i don't quite 
understand but nevertheless one god .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338')">0:05:38</a> no jewish prophet when they talk endlessly about 
god . particularly Isaiah there's a great passage    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> chapter after chapter about the oneness 
of god it never mentions the threeness of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('349')">0:05:49</a> god which is absolutely central to christian 
theology . so surely if this was essential to belief  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('356')">0:05:56</a> it would be mentioned by the prophets and it never 
is . so on these key christian doctrines of the    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> messiah to come being crucified and killed 
for the sins of the world and rising again    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> on the third day from the dead , the prophets 
are silent on the key doctrine of the trinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('378')">0:06:18</a> god , father , son and holy spirit , the prophets are 
silent . now this is really serious , paul in his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('386')">0:06:26</a> letters particularly 1 corinthians chapter 15 
verse 3 says that this is the gospel that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('394')">0:06:34</a> messiah would die according to the scriptures 
that he would rise again on the third day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('401')">0:06:41</a> in accordance with the scriptures , he 
explicitly references the scriptures    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('405')">0:06:45</a> as to substantiate and validate his own gospel 
and yet the scriptures do not say this anywhere .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('414')">0:06:54</a> this is very peculiar , this is indeed a christian 
mystery , a mystery perhaps we're invited to believe    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('420')">0:07:00</a> in but we surely must have some evidence for 
this mysterious belief particularly when it    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('425')">0:07:05</a> claims to be based on evidence that the scriptures 
themselves say that the messiah would die and be    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> raised again on the third day accordance with 
the scriptures , the scriptures don't say that .  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('437')">0:07:17</a> so there's no meant to be an attack on 
christianity but just an honest appraisal of   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('441')">0:07:21</a> the facts , the facts simply do not back up the 
claim . there is no trinity in the jewish bible ,   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('449')">0:07:29</a> there is no messiah who will be who was to come , 
who will die for the sins of the world and rise on    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('456')">0:07:36</a> the third day . i can find no reference to a third 
day anywhere in the jewish bible where it says    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> the messiah would rise on the third day . so i just 
wanted to share that with you , this is why i think    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('467')">0:07:47</a> the jews of paul's day rejected the christian 
claims about jesus being the promised messiah    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('473')">0:07:53</a> because they knew their scriptures when paul went 
into their synagogues and said look believe this    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('478')">0:07:58</a> and they said this belief is unknown to us 
it is not attested in our torah , Moses never    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> mentioned this belief , why should we believe you 
paul ? away with you out you're preaching bid'ah (Innovation)  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('491')">0:08:11</a> what you're saying is unknown to Moses and 
to the prophets of israel . therefore , we are    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('496')">0:08:16</a> not required to believe in your gospel , away 
with you . and that remains the jewish position    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> today . now there are other understandings 
of the messiah which are not objectionable   
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('507')">0:08:27</a> in terms of the jewish scriptures , the islamic 
understanding the messiah is much more in accord    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('513')">0:08:33</a> with the jewish understanding , that can be 
a subject for another video . but i just wanted to    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> share with you here why the jews of paul's day 
understandably rejected the christian claims    
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('525')">0:08:45</a> about jesus being prophesied and promised in 
the torah because he simply isn't . till next time
