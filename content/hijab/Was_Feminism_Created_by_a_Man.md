[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=46) sociological investigations that women

[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=127) heavy  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=128) so she realized  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=130) based on her own study this is betty

[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=152) the book she goes women have a profound  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=154) human impulse to have children well you  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=156) weren't saying that before  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=157) all the tone has changed now has it when  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=159) you see women are suffering and coming

[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=174) you'll be surprised she's not the only  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=175) one in 1981 after realizing the  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=177) troubling psychological impact of women  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=178) fridan states this let me just go with  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=181) for a second she has we had better find  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=183) a change  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=184) but change is hard because this is what  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=186) she says unbelievable unbelievable what  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=188) she says listen to this  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=190) she goes  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=191) because women have almost a religious  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=193) feeling about the woman's movement  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=195) allah  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=198) she says we've got to change this now

[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=201) because we're now becoming it's like  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=202) feminism has become religion who's  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=204) saying that betsy friedan one of the  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=206) founding mothers of feminism she goes i  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=208) realize we have to make a change she's  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=210) saying this i realize we have to make a  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=211) change but what but it's difficult now  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=213) because women have a what a religious  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=215) feeling towards feminism can you imagine  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=218) this  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=219) a sacredness a reverence an oh this is  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=222) what she continues it keeps us from  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=224) asking questions about what really  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=225) matters to women now  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=227) so  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=229) you see it's really negatively impacted  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=230) women she realizes that  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=232) she wants to change that but she can't  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=234) because she's already created a monster  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=236) she's already created the frankenstein  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=238) of feminism she's already helped  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=240) contribute to that and now she's trying  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=242) to pull women back actually we're going  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=244) too far no it's too far the frankenstein  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=246) has already been created and and you

[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=331) philosophical work that had been done on

[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=448) that you said she i detest my own  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=449) reflection  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=454) she goes  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=455) if at least my own thought had given  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=457) birth to a hill a rocket but nothing had  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=460) has taken place i'm astonished to  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=462) realize how thoroughly i have been  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=464) cheated cheated by who are you talking  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=465) about by yourself you cheated  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=468) yourself  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=469) yeah she's writing her autobiography she  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=471) thought we didn't read  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=472) she  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=473) then she also admits i don't know she  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=475) thinks it's a diary entry  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=477) she writes the following she goes  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=479) before her boyfriend satra came from  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=481) paris she was preparing her new  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=482) independent home in paris and waiting  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=484) for the return of satra from paris new  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=486) furniture is brought the walls are  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=488) papered and new clothes are purchased  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=491) oh you're trying to make an effort for  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=492) him are you  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=494) you're trying to make an effort for him  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=495) either but you tell the woman to what  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=497) not to get married but you wish you were  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=498) married you wish you had that commitment  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=501) he called her one time he said to her  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=503) because you know she came back home she  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=504) wasn't there she said you're like a mere  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=505) housewife  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=507) and obviously in their understanding  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=508) this is a huge embarrassment  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=510) she says i was furious with myself to  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=512) have disappointed him in this way  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=516) and you know he's the one by the way if  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=518) you look at her autobiography he  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=519) persuaded her  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=521) he's the one who persuaded her to write  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=522) the second sex so we have a valid  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=524) question here was second wave feminism  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=527) created by satra by a man was he the one  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=529) doing all the work was he the one  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=530) pushing her to do these things  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=532) why because it is in the benefit we're  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=534) going to come to realize it's in the  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=535) benefit of a man  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=536) it is this is what women don't  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=538) understand please some women do of  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=540) course but some women don't  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=542) feminist women  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=543) that feminism second wave benefits the  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=546) man  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=546) psychologically as we'll find more than  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=548) it benefits the woman he doesn't need to  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=550) commit  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=551) he doesn't need to have kids he doesn't  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=552) need all those things he can move him  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=553) one woman to another use and abuse  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=556) lash and dash he can  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=560) this is uh this is the situation  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=563) but  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=564) let's not uh mention that  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=567) what we should mention is some  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=568) sociological investigations and the  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=569) biggest one that's ever been done that i  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=571) know of  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=572) is this one that is mentioned it's  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=573) mentioned in the poem as well do you  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=575) remember what the lines were  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=579) yeah this is the last that's going  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=581) through  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=583) yeah this is the mirror  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=584) it's blanche flower and oswald this is  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=587) the name of the study 2000 okay a  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=589) hundred thousand participants a  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=590) longitudinal study from the years 1970  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=593) to the years 1990 in the uk and the us  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=596) huge study very difficult to replicate  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=599) and this is what the researchers said  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=602) that men are happier and women are  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=603) sadder  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=605) in the time period after the feminist  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=606) movement has taken force and after all  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=608) the laws have been placed and after the  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=610) attitudes have changed and after women  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=612) are going to work why are they happy on  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=613) the saddle well because let me tell you  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=614) why  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=615) because  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=617) they say legislative reform and so on  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=620) has not been successful in either  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=621) country in either  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=623) uh sorry in our country in creating  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=626) or uh on right raising the well-being  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=628) among women is the core is messed up a  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=630) little bit on the flights but that's you  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=632) see  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=635) this big thing is saying what in fact  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=637) the same study said you know who was  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=639) getting happier  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=640) men were getting happier they're getting  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=642) what they want  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=643) the commitment issues have gone down he  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=645) doesn't have to extract his resources  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=646) for her he can do he's got more money  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=648) now he can just  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=650) use her  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=651) move from woman to woman she's she's the  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=653) one she wants security she's the one  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=654) psychologically primed for these things  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=656) you want to play this game with a man  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=658) and you think you're going to be happier  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=660) you don't know what you're doing you've  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=661) created 20 years longitudinal study it  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=664) tells us that in fact your the the  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=667) welfare of women has degenerated  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=669) considerably or exponentially as a  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=671) result of what  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=672) as a result or after at least these  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=676) policies had been implemented  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=678) now  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=679) why is this the case or what should we  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=681) think about  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=682) i mean feminists know even the second  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=684) word feminist that there are differences  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=685) considerable physiological and  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=687) psychological and  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=688) even biological as we know differences  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=690) between men and women  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=693) but basically their argument is despite  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=695) all of these differences that we should  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=697) be treated the same  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=699) now the burden of proof is upon the one  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=700) who's making the claim why do we need to  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=702) be on the back  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=704) if they if someone asks you why is it  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=705) different for whatever ruling it is in  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=707) islam or whatever other system even  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=710) that differentiates between ruling and  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=711) men and women so why is it different why  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=713) should it be the same in fact  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=715) plato he made a very interesting quote  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=717) aristotle quotes him he says treat like  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=720) cases as like meaning identical things  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=723) should be treated identically  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=725) and different things by extension should  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=726) be treated well  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=728) differently  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=729) now your feminism doesn't accommodate  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=731) for the differences between men and  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=732) women that's a failure that means it has  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=735) less explanatory scope  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=737) now why should we cover for their  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=739) failure or even accept it as a  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=740) presupposition for answering their  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=741) questions they're asking why is it that  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=743) will come to it but why is the  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=744) inheritance difference why is polygamy  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=746) why is man can marry this and that why  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=748) should it be the same in fact  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=752) why is there an assumption of legality  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=754) of absolute equality this assumption  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=756) itself is unsubstantiated and in fact  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=758) they need to argue from first principles  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=761) they need to argue why it should be true  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=762) different things should be treated the  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=763) same  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=765) they need to argue that not us  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=767) and in fact this is one of the key  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=769) reasons  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=771) and very important here  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=772) why read that happens why apostasy  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=774) happens so why shack  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=776) happens  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=777) why  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=778) happens in a deen or a doubt and we  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=780) because we've been in the back foot for  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=781) too long have not been able to answer  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=783) this properly the way we answer is sorry  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=785) are you is the assumption that different  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=787) things should be treated the same  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=789) we believe  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=790) that  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=791) identicality and value does not mean  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=794) so equality and value does not mean  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=795) identica that identicality in rules one  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=798) more time  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=799) equality of value we do believe men and  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=801) women are equal in value yeah and  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=802) spiritual value they are equal equality  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=805) of value is not equivalent to  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=806) identicality and roles this is extremely  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=809) important sentence to memorize it  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=811) if they want  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=812) to tell us  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=814) that it should be the case they have to  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=816) argue for it it's not me that has to  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=817) argue for it  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=818) but you know what sometimes it's quite  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=820) easy  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=821) and it's quite straightforward if we  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=822) point to them the difference is between  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=823) men and women because some of them are  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=825) actually ignorant of it even though the  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=826) feminist founding fathers were not  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=827) ignorant of it and in the chapter  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=829) biology but the bovac she goes women are  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=832) weaker than men she will lose to them in  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=833) the fight she has less control of  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=835) herself and paraphrasing but that's the  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=836) idea she says in all this thing but  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=839) sometimes you have to show them that  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=840) that is that is a fact  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=842) let's let's giving  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/jwaftjQDOTc?t=844) let's give some examples of that
