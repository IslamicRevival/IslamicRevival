"Learning About Epistemology? - Critical Thinking" discusses the importance of gaining knowledge from both within and outside oneself. Jorah discusses how emotions can fit into the context of experiential knowledge, and how first-person experiences are important in epistemology.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu536euyd2c\&t=0)**  the presenter introduces the topic of epistemology, and discusses the three learning objectives for the series. She then asks a basic question: what is knowledge? The presenter provides several answers, but asks the audience to think about their own answer. Next, the presenter introduces the topic of concentration and asks the audience to think about how they come to know things. Finally, the presenter asks the audience to think about how to acquire knowledge.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu536euyd2c\&t=300)** This 1-paragraph summary of the video "Learning About Epistemology? - Critical Thinking" discusses the importance of gaining knowledge from both within and outside oneself. Jorah discusses how emotions can fit into the context of experiential knowledge, and how first-person experiences are important in epistemology.
*   \**[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu536euyd2c\&t=600)* Discusses the difference between knowledge acquired through the senses and knowledge acquired through other means, such as instinct. It also discusses the nature vs. nurture debate, and how some people believe that Muhammad was taught by instinct.
*   \**[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu536euyd2c\&t=900)* Discusses the concept of epistemology, which is the study of knowledge. It discusses the various ways in which knowledge can be detected, and concludes that there is no way to detect knowledge that does not exist in the material world.
*   **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu536euyd2c\&t=1200)**  philosopher and educator, John Peacocke, discusses the concept of doubt, and how it relates to knowledge. He explains that doubt exists when there is a lack of full knowledge, and that reasonable doubt is when something goes against logical principles. Peacocke also mentions Renee Renee Renee, a French philosopher who lived in the Renaissance period, and who wrote a book called the Meditations.
*   \**[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu536euyd2c\&t=1500)* Discusses the philosophy of doubt, and how it can be applied to various areas of knowledge. Six chapters are discussed, in which the author describes how he doubts certain knowledge that we take for granted. He gives the example of the five senses, and how he doubts whether they are truly functional. He ends the video by saying that there is one area of knowledge that he cannot doubt, and that is his own existence.

[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=29) so I'm not a liar but I kept on welcome\
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=32) to a new series of critical thinking\
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=35) obviously and critical thinking is as it\
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=38) says on the tin we're gonna try and\
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=40) equip you guys with the necessary and\
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=42) appropriate tools to understand things\
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=46) and more specifically understand things\
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=49) philosophically in the context of\
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=51) discourse in the context of discussions\
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=54) in the base that we have around things\
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=56) like purpose and so what we're going to\
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=59) start with the channel as an\
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=60) introductory lesson which hopefully will\
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=63) aim to lay some foundation some basic\
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=65) foundations on knowledge itself see if\
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=69) you can see behind me what we're doing\
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=72) today is simply to know how knowledge is\
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=75) acquired to understand the different\
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=78) philosophical perspectives on knowledge\
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=79) and to be able to make a judgment on\
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=82) epistemology these are the three\
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=84) learning objectives so by the end of\
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=86) this we should know what this topology\
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=88) is as a keyword that will enchant\
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=91) uncover but also we should have a\
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=95) judgment that were able to make on\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=98) Lizzie the hip joint with the one and\
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=101) only the man himself the one that you\
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=117) really someone that's not seeing that\
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=120) much body does a lot for the\
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=121) organization and obviously we have a\
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=123) brother honey as well some of you might\
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=125) know him from now let's get started with\
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=132) some required questions which online\
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=133) this is going to be an interactive\
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=135) session and so we're gonna ask a lot of\
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=138) questions and I want you guys to think\
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=139) about what we're talking about rather\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=140) than a me just giving you the\
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=142) information let's start with a very\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=144) introductory question what is knowledge\
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=149) yes information facts the dictionary\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=155) definition if you go on oxford\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=158) dictionary they'll say knowledge\
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=161) in fact said skills acquired you know is\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=164) how we use the word yeah in terms of\
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=167) common day usage is there anything else\
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=169) you add to that I don't think that's\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=176) correct this is true now having said\
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=186) that I want to answer your question um\
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=188) and this is a more fundamental question\
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=189) well actually there's a question on\
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=193) concentration actually let's think about\
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=195) this right I wanted to really think\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=196) about this and I thought the people are\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=198) home to think about this question as\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=200) well yeah how do we get to know or\
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=205) something in other words how do we\
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=206) acquire knowledge right so this is the\
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=209) question how to that question well I'd\
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=219) like you to do is you spend one minute\
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=221) by yourselves\
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=222) you know writing down some of the ways\
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=225) in which you think you come to know\
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=228) things so just by the minute wait\
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=233) whatever it may be just put down what\
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=235) you think is the correct answer\
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=237) we'll come back\
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=255) \[Music]\
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=287) \[Music]\
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=296) well I'm trying to very good very good\
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=298) very good things are what I'm trying to\
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=301) avoid in this series especially in the\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=304) introductory lesson I'm trying to grade\
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=306) my language as much as possible so\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=307) everyone can be included but there are\
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=310) some very good keywords that was\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=311) intended we will build up to using more\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=317) maybe complex terminologies and\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=319) important dis lesson well that's that's\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=321) what the small you say so knowledge\
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=323) gained from other places\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=324) okay can you expound on that so I did a\
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=330) degree biology and I want to learn about\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=332) the physical to gain this knowledge I\
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=337) have to read books relating to the topic\
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=340) so books would be a place where you gain\
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=343) money okay and how did you very simply\
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=346) how do you actually read books how does\
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=349) that work we use your eyes okay yeah\
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=352) camera words okay you interpret the word\
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=355) okay oh yeah so that's a question\
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=359) although the country is what we meant by\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=360) it so if you meant how we acquire you I\
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=363) was going to sell\
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=368) okay so five senses yeah okay very good\
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=376) answer\
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=376) Jorah exeter anything else is there any\
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=380) other way you can get and that's always\
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=385) limited you know okay excellent but\
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=387) you've made a point and you said there\
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=389) were two ways which is what as we're\
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=393) gonna find out Bertrand Russell himself\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=394) in the problems of philosophies in that\
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=396) book that will kind of we're using that\
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=399) kind of book by the way I haven't\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=400) mentioned it already does\
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=401) well we're using Bertrand Russell's\
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=403) problems and philosophies look it's a\
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=406) book which very small but very very\
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=409) important actually in the entomology\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=411) yeah because Apple isn't what called the\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=414) problems of philosophy where our lessons\
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=416) are being kind of scheduled in\
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=418) accordance with the chapters of that\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=419) book but it's not rigid in a sense that\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=422) we're not gonna go outside and the\
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=424) reason why chosen that particular book\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=426) is because you'll find that most\
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=429) universities that do things that they\
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=431) have that required reading yeah and and\
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=434) for good reason I comes out for Oxford\
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=436) University for its people a degree they\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=438) they don't allow you to do that degree\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=440) unless you have they do a lot of I mean\
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=442) they recommend before you actually get\
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=444) started with you me that you mean that\
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=445) book and it's because it gives you that\
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=447) foundation in you need right so the two\
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=450) things that you mentioned is very\
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=451) important because actually it's\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=452) mentioned it is right so five senses is\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=457) good yeah so it's kind of like the\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=459) outside yeah making it very simple but\
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=461) you also said knowledge from within so\
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=465) could you expound on that one please so\
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=468) this could be things that you learn\
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=471) about yourself things that you learn\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=473) about other people who are interacting\
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=475) with them so you said something discover\
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=480) something that's unique that you would\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=482) you know\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=482) it could be both so give us an example\
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=486) of that it could be both give an example\
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=487) of something which you already know so\
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=489) your personality like what things are\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=492) know you so I get really annoying when I\
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=496) see\
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=497) with homeless that's something that I've\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=500) learned about myself the best I'm not\
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=503) sure that's very good I think you're\
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=505) right your tracks but wait there's some\
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=507) there's still some refinement we can do\
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=509) yes or okay holding a little bit more I\
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=512) think a little bit deeper so what is\
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=514) that exactly\
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=515) you feel what noise you need to watch\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=518) people who used to I feel what we\
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=521) talking about is a certain emotion right\
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=525) yeah some cool this intuitive knowledge\
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=537) and some and you can also play within\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=540) that experiential knowledge okay so\
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=553) emotions will fit in that context of\
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=556) experiential knowledge because you\
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=558) experience the emotions you experience\
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=564) emotions now if you experience emotions\
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=567) it's first-person everyone on board\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=575) there are three kinds of person right\
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=578) which I want this person something which\
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=599) is first-person pronoun which is\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=600) first-person like okay give me an\
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=605) example of a second person pronoun to\
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=607) you okay and give me a couple of third\
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=611) person now if we come back to here\
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=618) emotions is it I knew or they'd be so\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=623) yeah this is your emotions we're talking\
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=626) about something which is first-person\
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=630) now this is\
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=631) very important the reason why it's very\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=637) very important especially in in\
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=639) acquiring knowledge yeah it's because\
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=642) the whole field of science you said\
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=647) you're violated again the whole field of\
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=649) science obviously this down here for\
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=651) this time the whole field of science is\
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=653) very personable in order for something\
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=659) to be scientific it has to be\
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=666) experimental science yeah okay what do\
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=674) anyway so scientific experiments are\
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=679) experimented upon they do not relate to\
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=683) your own subjective experience okay\
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=688) so science can't attack yeah cannot feel\
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=696) it can't detect that does that make\
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=700) sense how do you feel it's a\
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=702) first-person question what if you're the\
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=708) scientist whose discovery even if you're\
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=710) the scientist to discover right in any\
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=713) case your experience is always first\
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=716) person you say I feel where science is\
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=720) always that person has to you have to\
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=722) have an expert experiment yeah so that's\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=726) important\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=726) well the tongue will come to it later on\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=729) that's important so here we're worried\
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=732) or two things right I will stick to\
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=734) those who thinks because they're quite\
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=735) important so a quote the external and\
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=737) you've got the internal feel like yeah\
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=738) the external the five senses they\
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=741) they're the window to the outside world\
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=743) yeah and then you have intuitive\
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=747) knowledge and experience or knowledge\
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=748) it's more internal can you think of\
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=751) something else which is knowledge which\
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=756) you don't get from the five senses\
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=758) that's my question\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=759) give me examples of other kinds of\
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=762) knowledge which are not acquired through\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=765) the person\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=765) so we said experience our eight emotions\
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=768) this is relating back to the Quran\
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=772) hidden he knew how to do certain things\
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=775) for instance\
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=776) he made a hole in the boat you fixed the\
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=779) hole and he took care of that point\
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=783) these things these things here at wisdom\
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=793) \[Music]\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=796) this thing will knowledge their work\
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=801) from that world from within you could\
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=807) argue it's from now how do you why some\
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=809) say he was a prophet okay and if he's a\
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=811) prophet who's getting from why yeah\
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=813) which is from Allah you're onto\
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=817) something you're definitely on to\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=819) something here so you're not wrong\
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=820) complete what other knowledge is not a\
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=823) quiet from the outside world\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=830) consciousness is not really knowledge\
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=832) it's a state of being\
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=834) yeah well you're definitely right you're\
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=837) definitely right and so much of\
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=839) consciousness cannot be experimented\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=842) upon yeah yeah so consciousness is first\
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=845) person and third person yes that's great\
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=849) well we're sticking on the field of\
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=850) knowledge right so you think something\
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=852) that we do without exactly that's what\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=856) we just think about what do we know\
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=858) without using our five senses with\
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=861) animals some animals are born they also\
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=864) go any teachers around them no the first\
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=866) teacher to teach them and the only thing\
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=869) you know how to survive\
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=872) yeah maybe something that it's\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=878) programmed to do okay so this he wasn't\
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=881) taught you could argue this point you\
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=882) could argue this point this is cool\
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=884) instinct yeah with instincts well I'm\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=890) going to say because there is a debate\
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=895) in psychology called the nature versus\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=898) nurture people okay which I don't want\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=901) to go into too much voice idea is this\
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=903) baby really being tall or hot or is it\
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=906) something that they've gotten actually\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=907) yeah that's it the baby the one again\
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=909) but it's something you could argue yeah\
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=911) so I'm not gonna say it's wrong it's not\
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=914) completely undisputed okay\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=916) emotions are pretty much on this view\
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=918) that you can't say that they're instinct\
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=922) you could dispute what else is of the\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=923) way I think of this way in order for\
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=930) something to be detected by the five\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=932) senses what properties must I have has\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=936) to be pending okay excellent tangible is\
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=941) another way of saying one physical\
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=943) excellent so what do we know which is\
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=947) not physical\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=948) makes it physical things now give me an\
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=951) example or something we know which is\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=952) metaphysical\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=959) something we know which is that's\
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=970) religious yeah I'm saying something no\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=973) non-supe you've all disagreeable\
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=976) consciousness okay we know exist so what\
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=986) do we know gravity gravity we don't get\
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=990) the effect of yeah almost single\
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=995) scientific they're still in the tangible\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=996) world you can detect them to some extent\
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=998) yeah well the effect of their maybe\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1000) we're saying this thing is not in the in\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1003) the physical world at all and it's\
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1005) undetectable memory memories you can say\
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1009) you could argue this brain in neurons\
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1011) you could argue from a physical\
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1013) perspective love emotions or whatever\
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1017) but they call you also know you could\
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1023) argue that that's what materialists do I\
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1025) do\
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1036) okay yeah okay the question cannot be\
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1139) detected through scientific inquiry no\
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1146) every close to this can you can you feel\
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1152) numbers no can you taste numbers up can\
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1156) you see\
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1159) \[Music]\
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1160) Isaac Isaac that's a symbol the right\
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1163) totally good abstract concepts yes this\
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1172) is right so please put this down okay\
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1177) mathematics is knowledge from within\
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1184) which is undetectable in the material\
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1187) world okay all right that's excellent\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1192) all right so I think we're going to a\
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1194) very very good stuff I'm really doing\
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1196) just I'm happy to hear that\
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1202) now let's go to the next question if we\
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1204) know what knowledge is yes and this is\
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1208) what Bertrand Russell says in his first\
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1209) chapter as well okay if we don't want\
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1214) knowledge is the question is what is\
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1217) that absence of knowledge let's think\
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1223) about it for a second before we say that\
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1228) you can't be certain\
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1233) yeah it's what 70 is or here's the\
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1236) question\
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1237) that's what what is reasonable that\
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1253) hiccup I think because what do you say\
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1261) people we get people say I have doubts\
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1265) and it's not just a religious context\
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1267) doubts\
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1268) yeah and it could be I have doubts about\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1270) life I have doubts about meaning I have\
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1273) doubts about my performance I have\
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1275) doubts about X bar Y button question is\
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1278) what is reasonable doubt now what I want\
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1281) to think about more specifically what we\
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1288) to really think about is when is it\
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1293) two down when does it make sense to\
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1296) doubt something and I'm going to give\
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1301) you another hint actually coherence\
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1308) coherence is consistency yeah\
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1312) when does it make coherent sense to\
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1316) doubt in something hmm\
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1320) can you say for example did you know\
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1322) that study that was done by that guy who\
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1324) put some straws in there but there was a\
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1329) group of people they will keep choosing\
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1331) something comparing me they will\
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1338) continue to collect in that consistency\
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1341) and it won't doubt into the other\
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1343) person's mouth because we can looking\
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1346) you know the old finger so when you know\
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1348) something to be that I know for example\
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1350) when an egg drop it breaks so when I see\
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1353) it drop in a no break and I'm gonna\
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1354) think to myself if there's a doubt that\
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1355) you should have you're making points\
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1361) examples to give it examples of when now\
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1364) is apply that meteorite who those who\
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1366) don't but I want you to think more\
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1368) fundamentally now think about what we've\
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1370) just done yeah because doubt relates to\
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1373) one one certainty but something more\
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1377) fundamental insanity which we discovered\
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1379) think about the learning objective so\
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1384) what's the key word learning alright so\
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1387) doubt and knowledge are related yes\
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1390) so doubt exists when there's a lack of\
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1394) usually right okay so let's ask a\
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1397) question our game plan what is\
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1399) reasonable doubt when you have evidence\
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1401) to suggest that the pattern of coherence\
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1407) when there is a reasonable stray off the\
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1411) path alone okay so here what you're\
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1414) saying is a reason reasonable doubt is\
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1416) when something for example goes against\
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1419) logical principles okay when there is a\
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1426) lack of\
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1427) full knowledge okay that's important now\
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1431) support at the stage to think about\
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1434) something very close to the all right I\

[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1450) Rene Descartes okay this product no he's\
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1456) a big public and it's been an hour he\
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1459) isn't there on the water\
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1464) Renee Renee Renee take off yesterday\
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1468) okay\
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1471) he was a existed in the Renaissance\
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1476) period okay in the Renaissance the\
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1481) Renaissance period is anything between\
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1483) fourteen sixty or 1491 words but he was\
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1488) around he made a book called the\
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1493) meditations he was called a rationalist\
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1501) okay a rationalist\
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1509) and what he did I think that six\
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1511) chapters in his book six times and in\
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1514) each chapter what he did was he\
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1517) described how he doubts certain\
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1522) knowledge that we take for granted I'll\
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1525) give you one example of that to give you\
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1527) to to to drive the point he said for\
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1530) example the five senses we said five\
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1532) senses was a way of making sense in the\
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1534) world for us to know the world yeah he\
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1537) said how do I know for sure that my five\
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1542) senses are not deluding I'm going to put\
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1546) it down so how do I know for sure is the\
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1549) question hood that I'm not delusional in\
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1555) my understanding of the world as a\
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1557) result of my five senses\
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1560) now is there a possible is there a way\
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1563) of knowing that our five senses are\
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1566) perfectly functional it's different and\
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1570) it's a better question is their way of\
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1572) proving is there a way of proving that\
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1575) our five senses are perfectly functional\
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1579) no there's no way of proving that you\
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1585) cannot prove that the five senses are\
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1587) perfectly functional at the end of it\
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1591) what is called systematic doubt yeah\
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1594) systematic down in other words anything\

[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/qu536euyd2c?t=1605) he would reject him does not make sense\
