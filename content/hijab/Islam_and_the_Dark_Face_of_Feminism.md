discusses the origins and beliefs of feminism, and how it has changed over time. It argues that feminism is a racist movement, and that it is not synonymous with women's rights.  also discusses the conflict between feminism and radical lesbianism, and how Islam views the relationship between men and women.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=0)** This 1-minute video covers various Islamic texts that support women's rights, and discusses how feminism originated from different sources and only gained traction in the late 1800s. It argues that the phrase "women's rights" is not synonymous with "feminism," and that the Islamic texts support women's rights in all areas of life.

*   \**[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=300)* Discusses how feminism has changed over the years, from advocating for women's rights to demanding universal suffrage. The main point is that feminism is an ideology with its own scholastic tradition, and not all feminists are associated with that.  also discusses how feminism is a racist movement, and how it moved on to other issues such as universal suffrage.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=600)** Second wave feminism, beginning in the 1960s, was marked by a change in focus from the demand for women's equality to the focus on women's rights. This shift was motivated in part by the realization that women were not always oppressed, but rather that there were different forms of oppression and that women were not the only group suffering from them. Rebecca Felton, the first U.S. senator to be a woman, was a prominent figure in the second wave of feminism. She advocated for white supremacy and the lynching of black men, and her views are indicative of the unsophisticated and racist second wave narrative of feminism.
*   \**[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=900)* Discusses origins and premises of second-wave feminism, which focused on the need for women to be treated equally to men in terms of rights and opportunities. However, by the end of the movement, some feminists began to question this premise, arguing that sex and gender are not completely determined by biology. This tension between science and feminism has continued into the present day, with some feminists advocating for a "genderless" society and others arguing that sex and gender are inextricably linked.
*   \**[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=1200)* Discusses conflict between feminism and radical lesbianism. points out that if radical lesbianism is not considered to be a form of women, then women have not been oppressed. However, if radical lesbianism is its own category, then feminism becomes incoherent and contradictory. Islam encourages marriage and child-rearing, which clashes with the radical feminist stance that women do not need men.
*   \**[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=1500)* Discusses history and meaning of feminism, noting that the word has become meaningless and has created tensions between men and women. They suggest that men and women should not identify as feminism because there is no need for it.
*   \**[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC5K5PT-atA\&t=1800)* Discusses how Islam views the relationship between men and women and how it should not be a competitive one. He also talks about how Hawaii is a good example of how to live in a complementary relationship.

[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=121) female orphans in the Quran I would\
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=123) argue is more than any other ancient\
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=127) religious texts the Prophet Muhammad SAW\
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=132) Allah Allah who suddenly said in a\

[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=137) hijae and that certainly men are equal\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=140) to women but it's this equality that\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=144) we're going to contest and talk about\
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=146) today because what equality that the\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=148) prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam\
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=149) mean here the hadith itself was\
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=153) referring to will do and I assure was\
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=159) asking the Prophet Muhammad SAW\
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=160) hilarious mmm is it the same for men as\
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=162) it is for women and so he replied with\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=164) this phrase the inner man he said of\
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=166) jihad agenda certainly men are equal to\
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=169) women ie in front of the law in front of\
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=173) the Islamic law men are equal to women\
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=175) so long as there is not an indicator or\
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=178) what you refer to in Arabic is a Kareena\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=180) to indicate otherwise\
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=183) and most of Sharia or most of the Quran\
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=188) the camera the Quran Sunnah are very\
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=191) much for both sexes the Prophet Muhammad\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=196) sallallahu alayhi wa sallam on many\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=198) different occasions he told men and\
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=201) women\
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=202) he stole so many say a Huayra that be\
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=206) good to women in fact in his final\
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=208) speech in our offer he made this a point\
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=211) of emphasis just as he made racism a\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=215) point of emphasis and how we should\
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=217) avoid this as well so there is no doubt\
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=221) in anyone's mind and they cannot be a\
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=224) disputation that islam is pro woman's\
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=229) rights\
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=231) well the question remains is the phrase\
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=237) women's rights synonymous with the\
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=239) phrase feminism that question requires\
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=243) some kind of a historical investigation\
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=246) which we will go through today you see\
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=250) feminism as a phrase originated in the\
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=254) late 1800s it appeared in some French\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=259) texts some medical texts and others\
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=261) other texts it was not regarded as a\
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=265) term referencing women's rights in\
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=268) particular\
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=269) in fact it was seen as the rock roots\
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=271) return attempt to label women as\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=274) fanatics of some soul it was only seen\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=277) in a Scholastic sense after the 60s or\
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=282) 70s and if you go on for example Google\
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=284) Ngram it's a really interesting tool you\
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=287) write the word feminism you'll find that\
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=289) the word really wasn't being used up\
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=291) until the 60s 70s to refer to women's\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=294) right activism is this to suggest that\
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=297) for all of human history that women were\
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=300) not we're men and women were not asking\
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=303) for their rights or women's rights of\
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=306) course not is this to suggest that women\
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=309) only in the 60s and 70s began to realize\
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=312) that it's time to demand rights for\
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=316) women of course not so the point is this\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=321) is that feminism now is a political\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=324) philosophy it is a political philosophy\
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=328) if you go into a university they have\
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=331) gender studies they have political\
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=334) philosophy courses it's an ideology it\
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=337) has its own scholastic tradition and\
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=340) when someone says I am a feminist they\
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=343) are associating themselves with that\
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=346) scholastic tradition with that framework\
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=350) so someone can be an advocate of women's\
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=354) rights without being a feminist and that\
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=357) is the majority opinion and for example\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=360) America or other places where survey\
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=362) said are done and women decide to not\
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=365) identify themselves with feminism now if\
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=369) you look for example in Britain where\
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=371) the movement the Western movement you\
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=375) could say I'm not going to say it\
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=377) started in Britain because there was\
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=379) parallel movements in Canada in the\
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=381) United States of America in France and\
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=384) in Britain but looking at Britain just\
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=385) for an example here because it was the\
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=387) colonial mother of the world if you like\
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=392) for example in the 1640s 1650s there\
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=396) there kind of emerged this criticism of\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=400) the fact that women were not being\
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=401) educated\
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=403) for example bail through our matte skin\
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=405) a woman she she famously said if you let\
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=410) woman be false\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=411) you will let them be slaves she's very\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=414) interesting point in 1792 I think it was\
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=421) Mary Wollstonecraft came out she wrote a\
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=425) book called the vindication of\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=426) certification of women very very famous\
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=428) book it's seen as probably one of the\
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=430) most impressive books that started what\
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=434) is referred to sometimes as first wave\
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=436) feminism after her and during her time\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=440) after and around the French Revolution\
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=442) many people came out and the main demand\
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=446) was as follows this was the main premise\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=448) of feminism at that particular time the\
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=450) main demand was that women just like men\
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=453) have mental faculties they have\
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=455) intellect they have rationality and\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=457) therefore their intellect and\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=459) rationality should be nourished through\
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=461) the system of education and this was the\
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=464) main argument of Mary Wollstonecraft she\
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=466) said that we should be educated just\
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=468) like men why not we are we are\
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=469) accountable are we not were intelligent\
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=472) are we not we have intellect do we not\
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=475) have that so the argument was a very\
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=477) clear argument a very simple argument\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=482) and that's why it was a very true\
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=483) argument and not many people in history\
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=487) not many people in history really would\
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=490) go against the premise of those\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=492) arguments or I should say not\
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=495) many people today even because in the\
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=498) Dark Ages and in the in Europe you had\
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=502) serious problems when it related for\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=506) example to him his education so the main\
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=510) point is this moved on to what you call\
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=513) universal suffrage and here is where we\
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=517) need to really think about some very key\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=518) questions universal suffrage is the idea\
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=522) that men and women should both vote and\
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=524) in both the United States of America and\
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=527) United Kingdom and other places like\
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=529) Canada and France and other places there\
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=533) was a movement now to try and get women\
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=535) to vote\
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=537) now obviously once again from our\
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=541) perspective as Muslims we don't have any\
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=542) issue with this because at the time of\
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=545) the Prophet Muhammad SAW Allah resell em\
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=547) when they were given doing by Iowa's men\
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=549) and women doing beya\
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=550) we don't have an issue with this we\
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=552) don't have an issue with it\
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=553) fundamentally like you know the why\
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=556) should women not have a vote this is not\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=557) an issue for us so once again here there\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=559) was no line there is no line of\
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=560) demarcation we have not parted ways yet\
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=563) with the feminists with the so-called\
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=564) feminists because at this point in time\
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=566) by the way they didn't call themselves\
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=567) feminists those individuals didn't call\
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=569) themselves feminists some points need to\
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=573) be noted first wave feminism despite\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=577) having reasonable claims was a racist\
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=580) movement now wait a minute we're going\
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=582) controversial all of a sudden yes I am\
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=585) but it's the truth\
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=587) and most people would recognize this for\
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=589) example emily's canton who started this\
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=596) in the the Falls conference the Seneca\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=600) Falls conference in 1848 she was not\
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=605) happy with the fact that black people\
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=608) could get the vote for example before\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=610) white women would likewise Felton\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=616) Rebecca Felton Rebecca Latimer Felton\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=620) she was the first senator of the United\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=623) States that was a woman and she\
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=626) explicitly advocated white supremacy she\
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=629) was part of the KKK and she said that if\
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=632) it wasn't I cannot bear to see a black\
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=634) man you know vote on my rights I cannot\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=637) bear to see this and she even advocated\
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=640) the lynching of black men lynching she\
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=642) said I would rather see a thousand black\
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=645) men lynched every week then then for me\
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=649) too\
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=649) then for them to vote for my my issues\
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=652) and this is not isolated incidents even\
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=656) in the United States the United States\
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=657) but in the United Kingdom you had me\
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=659) listen for a four-set who's got a\
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=661) society named after her now in the\
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=663) United Kingdom it's called the Fawcett\
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=665) Society she was once again very appalled\
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=669) with the fact that New Zealand Maori\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=671) woman have a vote before white woman do\
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=674) so she this was a racist movement why is\
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=677) this very important because the second\
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=682) wave narrative of feminism which we're\
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=684) going to talk about more in detail has\
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=688) women being oppressed at all times by\
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=691) men this is the narrative this is the\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=692) story that here you have women on the\
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=696) bottom subjugated subordinated oppressed\
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=699) and then you have men on the top\
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=701) oppressing them my question if this is a\
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=705) generalizable statement can we say that\
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=710) black men were oppressing white women\
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=713) wait a minute say this one more time\
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=715) okay okay no problem I'll say again if\
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=721) this is a generalizable thesis that men\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=726) are oppressing women can we say in the\
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=731) context of the United States or the\
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=733) British colonial context that men of\
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=737) color and what I'm going to just say\
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=738) black men either black men living in the\
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=742) United States all colonial subjects of\
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=747) other nations can we say those men were\
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=749) were oppressing women can we say this\
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=751) it's impossible for us to make this\
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=754) claim the narrative of feminism\
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=758) therefore is an unsophisticated\
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=760) narrative because the narrative is this\
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=763) men are always oppressors and women are\
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=766) always oppressed but here's the question\
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=768) we must ask what men are you talking\
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=771) about and what women are you talking\
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=772) about\
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=773) and what time are you talking about\
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=776) because each time has its own context\
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=780) this is our this is our point of\
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=784) separation now we say that actually the\
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=792) narrative the story the myth that men\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=796) throughout all of history have been\
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=799) attacking and oppressing vulnerable when\
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=804) has some truth in it but it is not true\
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=808) absolutely we also find the opposite\
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=811) being the case do you think that Rebecca\
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=815) Felton\
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=816) the first senator of the United States\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=819) if she had her way that they would not\
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=823) have been an oppression against black\
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=825) men in the United States of America so\
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=828) here this is very important we cannot\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=830) say that the that men have been\
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=834) oppressing women all throughout of all\
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=836) of society now second where feminism\
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=839) really started in the 60s second wave\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=842) now usually it's divided into first wave\
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=845) the second wave and third wave that's\
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=847) how they divide it now yeah and they\
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=849) also divide feminism into liberal\
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=852) feminism Marxist feminism and radical\
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=854) feminine it loosely how they define\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=856) feminism historically and ideologically\
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=860) that's how they compartmentalize it in\
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=862) the 60s you have people like Simone de\
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=865) Beauvoir very influential if not in my\
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=868) opinion the most influential feminist\
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=870) maybe to have ever lived she wrote a\
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=873) book called the second sex you had bred\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=874) a betty Friedan who wrote a book called\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=876) feminine mystique you had these women\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=878) coming out and writing books about\
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=880) feminism and here now the premise has\
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=884) changed now this is very important\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=885) because the question would be okay\
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=887) what's wrong with being a feminist right\
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=889) now we don't know what's wrong with\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=890) being a fair isn't it just about women's\
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=892) rights I'll tell you what the problem is\
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=894) first wave feminism the demand was\
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=897) reasonable we need to women need to be\
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=899) educated just like men women need the\
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=902) vote just like men women need to be a\
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=904) part of public life just like men all of\
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=906) these were very reasonable demands which\
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=909) were premise for a very reasonable\
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=911) intelligible coherent premise which is\
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=914) that look men are accountable women are\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=916) accountable men are rational women are\
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=919) rational women are rational men are\
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=922) intelligent women are intelligent\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=923) therefore they should have the ability\
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=925) to nourish their faculties that is a\
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=928) coherent premise in the second wave you\
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=931) had completely different premise the\
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=933) premise changed\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=936) you had a theory now which was saying\
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=939) that men and women yes they are\
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=944) different this is what Simone de\
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=945) Beauvoir said in her book she mentions\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=948) it in her book the second sex she has a\
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=949) whole chapter called biology and she\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=952) says yes she even says women are much\
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=954) more emotional than men they cry this\
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=957) this that the weaker the men will be a\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=959) woman in a fight she said this and she's\
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=961) the most influential feminist of all\
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=962) time the mother of feminism and she says\
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=965) yes men are stronger and women are weak\
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=967) and these things we know this we're not\
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=968) ignorant she says we know this by the\
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=971) way if I had said this it would probably\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=973) seem misogynistic imagine if I was\
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=976) working in somewhere in Norway and say\
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=978) look women are more emotional than men I\
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=979) say this is problematic but if Simone de\
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=982) Beauvoir says it no problem anyways the\
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=985) truth can only be said by some people in\
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=987) certain corners anyways so here she says\
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=991) we know the differences between men and\
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=993) women there are physiological\
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=994) differences there are psychological\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=996) differences there are biological\
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=997) differences we know she says despite\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1000) this this is the point of second wave\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1003) feminism where the premise starts to\
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1005) crumble underneath she says we know this\
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1008) but despite the differences we should be\
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1012) treated the same that is the premise\
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1015) because gender is socially constructed\
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1018) she famously says that a woman is not a\
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1022) book you you're not born of woman you're\
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1024) made into one so gender is socially\
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1026) constructed therefore were equal we\
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1031) should be treated equally even though in\
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1033) terms of sex we are different first\
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1037) question can you prove this why because\
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1041) here you are you're saying ought to and\
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1043) should these are moral judgments the\
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1047) assumption here is that different things\
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1049) should be treated the same way my\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1051) question is how can you prove this is\
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1053) there a mechanism of proving this\
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1057) philosophically and she provides\
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1060) absolutely no mechanism whatsoever there\
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1063) is no mechanism now it becomes even more\
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1066) ridiculous because and by the way many\
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1069) who would agree with me even as\
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1071) feminists on this point third wave\
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1074) feminism for example a woman called\
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1077) maanteeeca\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1078) Wittig who wrote a book in 1996 and also\
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1081) Judith Butler I think she's still she's\
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1085) still alive now these women now are\
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1087) saying that sex itself is socially\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1091) constructed wait a minute please\
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1093) why did you have to go there why did you\
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1097) have to say such silly things\
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1098) what do you mean sex is socially\
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1100) constructed they use post-modernism post\
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1103) structuralism and these things and they\
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1104) say sex you know what when I say sex\
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1106) we're talking about when a baby is born\
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1108) they are born with certain genitalia a\
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1110) man is born with a penis a woman is born\
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1113) with a vagina\
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1114) yes we can we can see no this is a\
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1118) social construction okay my question to\
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1125) you how do you know I would say to have\
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1127) how do you know what you're saying is\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1129) not a social construction how can you\
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1131) prove what you're saying is not socially\
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1132) constructed this is why would Oscar\
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1136) so what extent now is because now\
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1139) there's a tension between science and\
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1140) feminism you're denying biological\
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1146) realities so you can make a point at a\
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1149) metaphysical point which cannot be\
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1151) proven why did they have to say this is\
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1153) the question very important question why\
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1154) did they have to go down this route and\
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1156) say that sex is socially constructed or\
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1158) that it doesn't matter sex does not\
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1161) determine gender in any way shape or\
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1164) form why did you have to go down that\
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1165) line of reasoning to fill the gap that\
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1168) Simone de Beauvoir left which is what\
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1170) she had no mechanism of proving that\
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1173) differences should not be treated in\
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1176) different ways\
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1177) in other words Simone de Beauvoir said\
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1180) yes we have biological differences but\
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1182) we should be treated the same but she\
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1184) didn't tell us why or how now these\
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1187) other feminists that came afterwards\
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1189) they realized that there's a problem in\
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1190) that reasoning and they said to make it\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1192) easy for us we're just going to say yes\
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1195) that sex and gender have no connection\
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1197) whatsoever sex and gender have no\
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1200) connection whatsoever therefore\
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1203) you can be whatever you want to be and\
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1205) this woman Witek she says lesbian women\
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1208) because she was a lesbian radical\
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1209) lesbian she said that by the way a\
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1212) radical lesbian means that she believed\
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1215) that lesbianism was the way forward for\
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1217) women in order to assert themselves\
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1218) independently she said that lesbian\
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1222) women are not women fiber\
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1226) what's the portion I mean what do you\
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1229) say about this how do we respond to that\
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1231) now the point is this fine if they're\
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1234) not women then women have not been\
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1235) oppressed if they're not women then okay\
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1238) was the whole point the whole thesis\
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1240) drops then were they then not men\
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1243) they're not women they're their own\
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1246) category and this is where the feminists\
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1249) start to attack each other because of\
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1252) the incoherence of the premise of\
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1254) feminism the new premise after the\
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1256) second wave for example Germaine Greer\
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1258) who is she's Australian born but she's\
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1261) now based in the UK she wrote a book in\
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1264) 1970 called the the Female Eunuch which\
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1267) means this means someone who has been\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1270) castrated you know anyways very famous\
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1272) book she came on Newsnight was one of\
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1275) those TV programs and she said that\
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1279) transgendered people yes\
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1281) transgendered people there are not\
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1284) really women so they're all\
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1286) contradicting each other one is saying\
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1288) biology has everything to do with it the\
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1290) other one is biology has nothing to do\
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1291) with it\
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1292) this one is saying sex is linked to\
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1293) gender this one is saying no gender is\
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1295) not linked to sex they are contradicting\
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1297) each other because there is no basis for\
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1299) what is gender\
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1300) what is sex they're all contradicting\
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1302) each other it's literally ramblings this\
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1305) is this is what it is it's become\
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1306) ramblings philosophical ramblings and\
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1310) they're all contradicting each other one\
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1312) after the other the question is why as\
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1316) Muslims for example why can we not\
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1319) associate with this because of many\
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1322) reasons number one Islam is clear in its\
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1326) demarcation between men and women men\
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1329) are biological born as males etc women\
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1334) are and the feminist movement is not\
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1335) agreed upon this\
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1336) and they would seem to suggest that\
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1339) gender is socially constructed this is a\
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1342) problem number two the second wave\
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1344) attack on motherhood the second wave\
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1348) attack on motherhood Simone de Beauvoir\
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1350) has a whole chapter on motherhood and on\
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1354) marriage and she herself never got\
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1356) married and never had children and she\
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1358) thought it was oppressive by virtue of\
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1361) the fact that you do it that you will be\
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1364) oppressed so in other words she thinks\
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1365) that if a woman has a child this she's\
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1368) oppressing herself and she never had a\
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1369) child and its really interesting by the\
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1370) way if you go online you were right her\
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1372) name City born de Beauvoir you'll find\
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1374) that she always wears a hijab it's\
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1376) really interesting I've never seen this\
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1379) woman without her job but she never had\
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1382) a child she never had children she never\
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1386) had a children she never had a children\
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1388) and she never got married and she\
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1389) thought the whole thing was a present so\
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1391) islam encourages marriage encouraging\
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1395) encourages for you to have children\
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1397) therefore there is a contradiction 0.3\
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1400) their attitude towards men generally\
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1404) there they would argue that men are not\
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1406) the enemy\
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1407) betty Friedan said this men are not the\
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1408) enemy but in other parts of her book she\
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1410) says you know in feminine mystique as\
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1414) she wrote in 1963 she said that you know\
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1416) we're in a comfortable concentration\
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1417) camp comfortable concentration just\
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1419) listen to the listen to the words that\
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1421) she's using women in a home are in a\
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1424) comfortable concentration camp how can\
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1427) you have a comfortable concentration\
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1429) camp that's a contradiction in terms a\
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1431) concentration camp is uncomfortable by\
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1433) nature it's meant to be uncomfortable so\
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1436) I can have a comfortable concentration\
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1438) camp anyways these things are extreme\
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1441) ramblings of women who came to\
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1447) radicalize a thesis which was coherent\
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1451) at first and then it became\
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1453) unintelligible incoherent and\
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1456) contradictory so feminism now when you\
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1460) say I'm a feminist\
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1461) people don't even know why if for\
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1463) example I've been to many universities\
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1464) in the UK and we've talked about\
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1467) feminism and I'm not gonna do this here\
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1470) guys you know in no way well I say put\
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1472) your hands up if you're a feminist oh\
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1473) I'm a feminist I believe women's rights\
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1475) so I take one of the people from the\
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1477) audience I say what book have you read\
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1478) about feminism and they say I don't know\
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1481) I haven't really read any books by I\
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1483) believe in women's rights I believe in\
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1485) women's rights as well yes but when you\
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1488) read the works of the feminists you will\
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1490) realize very very quickly that actually\
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1493) especially second-wave feminism it goes\
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1495) a little bit too far and third wave\
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1498) feminism is just nonsense for most\
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1501) people anyways it's just nonsense and it\
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1504) has no basis whatsoever and that's why\
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1507) you'll find that they're contradicting\
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1509) each other on key issues on transgenders\
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1512) on for example what do we do about the\
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1515) objectification of women pornography\
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1517) Andrea Dworkin who is an individual who\
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1521) wrote about feminism and pornography etc\
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1527) she talked about for example there's no\
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1530) difference and this is once again I have\
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1532) to check if I read this correctly\
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1533) between consensual sex and rape Foreman\
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1537) has sex with a man consensually and if\
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1539) he rapes her so we might as well as men\
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1541) we might as well you know\
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1542) according to her theory forget this\
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1543) whole thing of rape let's just do what\
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1545) we need to do what nonsense is this\
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1548) I mean if you really read what they say\
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1551) you cannot identify with their\
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1553) statements if you are rational honest\
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1555) person with sincerity if it was a matter\
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1557) of women's rights and women need to be\
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1560) educated just like men women need to be\
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1562) given rights just like men you we know\
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1565) in the 1800's in this country that you\
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1569) had certain acts put into place for\
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1571) example you had the infant custody act\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1576) you had in soil in this country in the\
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1578) UK you had in the infant custody act you\
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1582) had you know the married women's\
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1585) Property Act all of these acts the\
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1588) Matrimonial Causes Act all of those acts\
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1591) for example gave women rights to\
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1593) property and they gave women rights to\
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1595) for example divorce the divorce woman's\
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1598) act I forget the name of the Act these\
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1601) were all of the 1800s they were put into\
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1602) place but all of these thing\
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1603) well given to women 1,400 years ago the\
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1607) prophet mohammed salah say a woman came\
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1609) to him she said to him Lola I'm a - that\
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1612) was asked of you Burgi about her husband\
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1613) if it wasn't for the fear of a lot of\
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1615) spat in his face I don't I can't stand\
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1618) the guy\
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1618) for Farah Hebei Tahoma he he got them\
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1621) what can I had a I will hold on till\
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1623) Islam this was the first Alliance Lam\
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1624) woman had the right to divorce a\
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1626) thousand four hundred years ago not in\
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1628) this car in in the UK and the u.s. in\
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1630) these countries it was like 150 years\
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1632) agos nonsense and that's why there was a\
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1634) need for that kind of narrative but\
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1638) that's why there was a need for it woman\
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1640) didn't have the rights on their own\
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1641) property\
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1642) women were being sold in the Victorian\
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1643) period did you know this married woman\
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1645) were being sold as could wife selling\
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1648) there were books written about a wife\
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1651) selling in the Victorian period they\
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1652) were used to be sold a wife used to be\
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1653) sold in England Hey bye my wife this is\
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1657) what used to be that's why there was a\
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1660) need a certain point in time for there\
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1665) was a need for a kind of movement or you\
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1667) could say a kind of effort to get rid of\
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1670) this kind of thing because the premise\
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1675) that men and women are rational\
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1677) accountable actors didn't link with the\
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1679) social organization of that particular\
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1681) time another interesting feminist and I\
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1684) found this really really interesting she\
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1687) is probably one of the biggest names in\
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1689) all of feminism her name is Virginia\
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1690) Woolf and she wrote a book in 1929 she\
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1696) actually wrote many books which one of\
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1698) them was called the three guineas and\
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1699) you know what she said in this book and\
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1701) she's one of the you know she's regarded\
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1703) as one of the biggest feminist thinkers\
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1704) and this is what I will conclude with\
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1705) because I've got one minute 55 seconds\
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1708) why shouldn't we be feminists she said\
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1710) this she said the word feminism it used\
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1717) to refer to when a woman couldn't make a\
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1720) living for herself now all one has the\
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1722) rights that she didn't have so she says\
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1725) now the word has become meaningless and\
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1727) she's writing in 1929 less than 100\
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1731) years ago she goes the word has become\
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1732) meaningless and any meaningly meaning\
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1737) what is morally corrupt she said she\
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1740) referred to the word feminism as they a\
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1742) morally corrupt word because it would be\
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1745) assumed that she thought it would create\
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1746) more tensions between men and women\
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1748) there's no need to use this word 1929\
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1751) she's talking about this before the\
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1753) second wave of feminism even started\
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1755) she's saying it's a morally corrupt\
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1757) words and I will end somehow the line\
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1760) that's why I will say to or men or women\
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1762) who say why should we not identify as\
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1764) feminism because the need for using that\
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1767) terminology is not existent you don't\
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1770) need to use it you don't need to use it\
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1772) you can say I believe in women's rights\
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1773) the Koran says why Matt well well man\
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1777) says the men know my father a lot about\
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1778) the Kamala but this is beautiful a lion\
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1780) that allows us to the to us do not wish\
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1786) for what the other person or what the\
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1791) other gender has lately Jerry now sebum\
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1794) accessible men have a portion of what\
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1797) they have earned well in they say in a\
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1799) sebum mimicked s7 and for women there is\
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1803) a portion of what they have burnt in\
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1805) other words men and women in Islam are\
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1810) both treated with justice and they have\
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1815) a complementary relationship with one\
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1818) another we should not be attempting to\
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1821) compete with one another with the things\
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1823) that either of us don't have some things\
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1826) men can do that women can't and some\
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1829) things women can do that men can't and\
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1830) so therefore we should live in\
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1833) complementing one another and Hawaii and\
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1836) like the day in the night covering one\
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1839) another in that sense and it should not\
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1841) be a competitive relationship rather it\
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1843) should be a complementary relationship\
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1845) for salam aliekum wa rahamtullah were\
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1847) together\
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/sC5K5PT-atA?t=1848) \[Applause]
