[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=27) religious [ __ ] your family and it's very  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=29) important that's why I emphasize and  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=32) underline it religious because it is  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=33) correct that there many Iranians not  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=36) just outside Iran by even inside Iran ah  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=40) Annie Bodmin a Dean how do we say this  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=45) far with that far away from religion air  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=47) I'm not generalizing I'm not saying the  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=50) majority but I'm saying it's it's it's  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=51) huge numbers it's known it's I remember

[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=58) you go first thing you hear from people  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=60) from universities and where they say oh  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=61) you're on is it all fast

[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=81) it's it's very ironic the sheer religion  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=84) and the scholars they claim that it's  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=86) very mana wien are you saying that

[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=531) that every Iranian says this now of  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=533) course I know it  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=534) realizing you want to go to a mosque and  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=537) you mostly Ryan's are not religious  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=539) this guy was more or less religious  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=542) sayings Salam to you with your limited  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=545) there's another form they say yeah Ali  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=547) or it your means I have listened more  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=550) languages its Farsi Ali Ali he arm

[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=563) religious Iranian share culture it is  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=566) common to say by Ali yari my dad Ali is  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=572) the source at least the help and Ali  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=574) Allah's I got it and he's a companion  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=576) Ali will protect you  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=577) Ali audhu billah there's another one  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=579) over god Ali push the pan on it re maybe  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=584) your back and front may protect you you  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=586) win a problem is brother when you  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=589) mention these things they will say oh  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=590) this is tower soul this is you know they  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=593) open another kind of warmth or they want  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=595) to drag you into other discretion which  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=596) has nothing to do with it  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=597) giving pure heretical non-islamic  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=603) polytheistic practices the stamp of what  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=610) you call it an Islamic approval stamp as  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=612) if if you call something which is horror  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=615) fee which is superstitious which is  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=617) bigger which is something never I'll  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=618) even ever thought of did never that I  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=620) debated just call it our stroller you  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=622) call it this and then it's fine anyway  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=625) so that was the first little shock right  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=627) because of course I was bonus here of  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=630) course I heard it before how I was  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=633) thirsty for Islam  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=634) I wanted my thirst to be quenched by  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=637) Islam so I saw other people around me  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=640) although as I mentioned it was very rare  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=642) people in my age to be religious in the  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=644) 90s where I was from but I knew the  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=647) Muslim sister damn alaykum Salam Fayyad  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=650) in Farsi it's not common to say why I  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=652) alaikum Salaam or when you say when  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=654) Persian in language when you say by you  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=657) don't you say hold our office hold  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=659) office means who died only Allah any  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=662) fear Manila I'm not saying they don't  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=664) say this of course the sacred office as  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=666) well but they also say this  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=668) share gated I just mentioned you you  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=670) know sometimes people say we worship  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=672) Allah also sometimes we call upon him  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=674) alone as well yeah but you but it's  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=676) coming to say Ali are it Ali pushed upon  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=679) it  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=679) your I limited just because you added  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=682) hold on her face sometimes of often or  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=684) less so that doesn't change yes how is  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=686) he an organisation that's very common I  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=688) would have been it's very common so had  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=694) it towards the Masjid was called Masjid  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=697) Imam Ali and it's funny they loved it  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=700) and I realized when when I first time  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=703) when I visited London the Islamic Center  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=706) of England no they're very they're very  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=710) confident they don't go observe this  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=711) love is the love is this love except of  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=712) England masha'Allah say where I was from  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=715) they call themselves the Islamic Center  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=717) of that cities nobody nobody I don't  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=719) know who made them the Islamic Center  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=720) away but wherever they go especially  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=722) they run in branches which is from the  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=724) regime the column says quickly the  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=726) Islamic Center we went there beautiful

[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=786) where there's not many Muslims there's  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=788) definitely mosque I had to travel every  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=790) day one hour to this mosque and I loved  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=794) it to go because I was thirsty for Islam  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=797) so it took me every day one hour to go  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=800) there as I'm

[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=813) sensation but I loved it because as I  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=816) said I had a thirst for Islam was  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=818) unbelievable yeah even my family members

[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=885) to have to explain bits and parts of  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=888) Iranian culture and the current  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=890) situation religion in general is  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=894) perceived among the Iranians how bad the  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=897) situation is imagine how bad the  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=899) situation is for the mullahs themselves  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=902) look at the door they thought that I'm  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=904) probably I'm I'm I'm from the Mahabharat  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=908) from the intelligence or from from maybe  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=911) you know from yeah hooligans or someone  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=913) who's taking take it as a joke they  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=917) couldn't believe it because the only  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=919) people who came to the mosque even here  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=921) in the West I remember first time  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=924) visited London and I saw a Shura the day  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=928) of ashura I passed the Kilburn mosque  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=930) islamic center of england mashallah  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=934) I saw suddenly hundreds of Iranians  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=938) hundreds many well-known ones as well  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=941) all of them had a food is a very famous  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=943) food we have it's very nice by the way  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=944) it's called came in it's a nice food but  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=947) especially given on a Sharad Muharram  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=948) ice all of them each of them with one  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=951) under another hump it then I was a  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=955) Pakistani brother I said to them do you  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=956) know what's going on he said to me  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=957) brother I just know this place always  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=959) empty normally but when it's mahara labs  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=962) or leap exactly I was active in a major  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=966) big Iranian center on the Day of Ashura  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=969) and Muharram generally especially the  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=971) Raja they told us because I told you I  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=973) was very active in the mosque over 3,000  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=978) Iran is come but normally a normal day  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=982) is not just normal days even German are  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=983) the majority of people who came through  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=985) Jamaa when non-iranians why is that it's  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=989) because Iran is a so far from religion  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=992) it is so strange  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=994) it was so strange even to the mosque  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=996) when they saw me they thought that I'm  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=999) the son of some moola or that I might be  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1002) some son of someone from the embassy

[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1013) mosque  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1014) no Muslim : nobody associates it with  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1018) politics or your you being a son of a  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1022) mullah or some of Sheikh it's normal you  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1025) have a beer is normal many Egyptian  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1026) you've of it in Iran this situation is  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1028) so bad that if you look at certain type  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1031) religious Islamic according to them they  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1033) call you by CG Mulla Mulla son will be

[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1038) which again shows how bad the situation  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1040) is how bad mainly what they have what  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1043) they have done in the last 35 and more  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1045) plus years that in hundreds are so far  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1048) from religion that if you happen to be  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1050) Iranian religious first thing people  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1052) will assume from the move from the  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1055) regime so what was the turning point for

[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1222) I knew something is wrong so what was  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1225) when did you become soon division it was  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1227) when my Blake beliefs became shaky when  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1230) I was at that Center and it was a time  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1232) where I studied and read I had a library  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1234) in a number of languages was not  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1236) somebody who was just like I wasn't just  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1238) a follower  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1239) yeah I was active I was a leader so but  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1245) these things obviously had an influence  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1246) with me and deep inside myself I knew  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1250) something is wrong but that's why I  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1251) mentioned the psychological part that  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1254) people who are in the minority are  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1256) always defensive so remember one day I  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1258) was making it wasn't him who do and then  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1261) there was a one cheery fellow who knew  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1264) easily you I sent you you dangerous so  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1267) what are you gonna become one day will

[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1274) will never leave him out personally  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1276) Salaam and you know brother I believe  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1279) that I did not lie on that day because  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1282) there is a Exia from behind it's a  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1284) famous book in Arabic unfortunately you  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1287) see we also know we are mocha City we  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1289) haven't done our work our homework all  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1290) this stuff is not translated is a book  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1293) by a cheery person from Bahrain who  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1295) wrote and the translation you could  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1297) translate it as how I gained the Sahaba  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1299) I did not lose their weight so I wasn't  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1303) lying when I said well lo hee I will  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1305) never look leave the moment I say my  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1307) lisanna and I did not because by leaving  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1309) to share Europe you are not living a  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1312) hell great the this logic is like it's  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1316) difficult to understand to fathom from  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1318) the shitty side but for us as Muslims it  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1321) should be very logical just like when  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1322) you do that to a Christian person let's  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1325) say he's an Egyptian Coptic Egyptian you  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1327) say big white becoming Muslim are you  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1329) losing Jesus are you becoming a real  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1332) follower of Jesus are you giving him  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1334) his hack that he deserves no Hulu no  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1338) exaggeration you want to say you want to  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1339) become a real follower of Jesus because  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1342) on what you are upon right now is Hulu  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1344) its extremism is over exaggeration so  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1347) same with me so in these two years when  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1350) I was there when I had these my beliefs  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1352) became shaky but I couldn't express it  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1356) it was in 2003 so now we are heading to  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1360) the end of my story  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1362) ed was it 2003 where there was a last  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1366) kind of visit Iran obviously I never  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1368) visited Iran  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1368) I can't of course because of my  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1372) activities and TV and so on so forth so  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1376) 2003 some of the last time I visited  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1378) Iran I still consider myself of course  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1381) iary but it even gave me I had even I  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=1385) was how you say jealous I was like

[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2233) of Fatima this criminal person but this  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2237) was before obviously the war that was  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2239) obviously before this is we're talking  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2240) about 2003 but what doesn't matter he is  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2243) not that he hasn't committed crimes so I  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2247) saw this how many person they're people  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2250) beating themselves slightly I said yeah

[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2255) involved but that doesn't make it better  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2257) and I when I saw this you know but  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2259) they're just very important point enough  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2261) to make you know they have a lot of  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2262) power the mirages yeah she is causing a  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2265) lot of power upon the  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2266) layman because the commoners because  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2269) there's the tackle it is tackling what  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2271) they call it that lead is very strong  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2272) rooted in them literally they follow  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2274) blindly the scholars and they claim it's  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2277) only in fear and not appear but most of  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2279) them don't research so seeing what was  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2283) going there in harmony the moment  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2284) harmony came in people slapping this  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2286) even that Mohammed guy was with me was  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2289) holy man and said you know don't worry  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2291) what you're seeing is a bit extreme or  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2293) you know it's a some dude little bit  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2296) extreme I could accept what he said  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2299) because I was like these people will  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2300) slip they can stop everything around for  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2304) example whether the tie is forbidden  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2306) prohibited and official what you call it

[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2312) government buildings you're not allowed  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2314) to wear tie did you know that it's  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2315) because they could say it's a it is a  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2317) symbol of imperialism Westerner Western  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2322) ISM and so on so forth  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2323) so this person harmony in the regime who  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2325) can prove it something like a tie in  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2327) schools and in government buildings  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2329) right why is he not doing nothing

[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2351) there's a lot of things I could tell but  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2355) really to cut it short I came back to

[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2368) haven't become first I did not become  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2370) friend with him he was there was a

[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2380) lot of articles refuting shiism  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2382) comment she doubts our herrera this Omar  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2385) that Abu Bakr this nonsense along no  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2388) it's not long time it's gone but when I

[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2393) to the Atman I said you know Savi master  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2396) enemy of alidade enemy of our limit

[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2407) form or she a scholar from Tehran  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2411) I had to fled Iran complete because my  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2414) family is super religious and biased and  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2419) look I'm going to prove to you that she  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2422) isn't 12 mm ISM is based on the most  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2426) shaky foundations you can imagine  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2429) mutashabiha had we call in Arabic and  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2431) biggest evidence from the best thing he  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2434) said you bring me from the Quran ayah  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2437) that here I will I will answer to you

[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2448) a confidence suddenly especially in our  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2450) early 2000 there was not many websites  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2452) you know dealing with this stuff  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2452) probably the worst one  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2454) not a single Sony website except this  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2456) one anyway brother days and weeks of  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2460) exchanging mails until I reached a point  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2464) and I were really reaching the end where  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2466) I said I said I can't be here anymore  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2469) shi ism is 12 we have to be precise 12  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2474) ISM is based on mutashabiha heart and  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2478) biggest evidences I loved one thing he

[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2484) listened all false religions you can  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2488) expose them and find out their weakness

[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2501) are the foundations he said you go to  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2502) the Christians they believe the Jesus  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2505) the big rocks and literally begotten Son  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2507) of God and you have to worship Him and  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2509) he's literally God then you ask for  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2511) evidences I once had a debate with a

[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2542) considered as a horrendous belief that  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2544) Jesus literally the son of God

[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2589) prophet appointed at is a successor this  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2591) is not true of course it's also not true  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2594) that the prophet only said that's my  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2595) friend is a straw man they make up  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2597) strohman there suddenly say that the  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2598) Prophet SAW Salim said this is my friend  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2601) you already acclaimed this Sunnis have  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2604) written about it it has a context Hadiya

[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2615) taught here for the sake of argument  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2618) even if we would surrender let's call it  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2620) surrender and say okay  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2621) aya verse 33 surah ahzaab so-called ayah

[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2640) they believes of Anniston and so  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2642) superior so clear so found it and hold  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2647) on strong pilis let's call it that we  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2652) can even go the extra mile and say to  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2654) opponents by even if I surrender in this  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2657) case still your religions not prove it  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2659) even if I did is about Ali how  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2661) where's divided for the other eleven

[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2669) permission you add the other ones of  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2670) course they will come up with what more  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2673) and biggest and more ambiguous arguments  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2676) and this is where we reached the end  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2678) that the last advice this actually our  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2682) friend ago and if he watches it right  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2684) now I set my salams to him because it  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2686) was a super help for me to really to to  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2692) leave she raised him completely because  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2694) I was at this stage when I came back to  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2696) Iran and when I debated and discussed  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2697) with him at the beginning where I said  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2699) I'm not a sharing anymore can't be she  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2702) back home this one is like why because I  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2705) was all these years Sunnis follow on my  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2708) ads Manuel mayor abu rida I don't know  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2711) as a liar of the law no he made up a  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2713) hadith Omar did or mark killed Fatima I  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2715) don't know and Abu Bakr did the sentence  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2717) and husband what he did this all these  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2719) things that the likes of Nashua knee  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2721) when they're in their own mosque when  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2724) they discuss this well apparently not  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2726) ready or maybe inshallah they are ready  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2728) to discuss it with knowledgeable Sunni  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2730) brothers all these things were of course  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2731) in my mind so it was difficult for me to  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2734) make this decision and it was not a  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2735) light I didn't take it are you saying  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2737) English lightly I didn't take it lightly  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2739) I was not the kind of person say okay  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2741) I'm gonna leave now I did not take the  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2744) decision lightly  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2745) it caused me trouble in my life I can  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2747) never visit my country again as long as  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2749) specially as long as these mullahs are  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2750) ruling there I don't mind candala i've

[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2785) have to be honest with each other some  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2786) people might call this very session here  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2789) sectarian and why talking about these  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2791) things when Muslims have trouble are in  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2793) trouble here and then wars are going on  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2795) we say for everything there is a  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2797) situation at a time this is correct but  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2800) the problem discussing these things  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2801) honestly everybody I always say in this  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2805) age has a member in Arabic we say this  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2808) has a pulpit pulpit everybody has a  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2811) camera can do a speech yes many people  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2814) watching right now my curse me might say  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2816) that I'm a liar I don't know everyone is  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2818) free but the thing is they must accept  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2820) that it's not the time for their house  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2824) on a job it's not on time for years soon  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2827) it's just watched we are not sick  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2829) wallahi compared to what they do their  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2832) TV channels as I said revolve most of  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2835) the time about what soon isms how bad it  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2838) is Sahaba did that I mentioned al Bayt  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2839) TV has a whole show about so-called  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2841) convert we are Allison it's not like  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2844) brother we don't have X years well I and  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2846) this very City alone that I was it right  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2849) now I have seen so many and I know so  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2851) many a of us we have many in Iran there  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2854) is a phenomenon a few days it's  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2856) acknowledged by the regime in the  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2858) biosolids you have heard probably in a  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2860) [ __ ] thousands and hundred thousand  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2863) of people have become so know so much  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2865) and even the regime is not denying it  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2866) it's just we do not convey these news to  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2872) the Ummah and as soon now we have to be  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2874) honest via mocha Saleem we haven't done  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2876) our homework there's a lot of books by  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2877) Exia scholars there are much more worthy  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2880) to be here about than me but it's not  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2883) been translated over let's go from Allah  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2885) Quran has been a pleasure having you on  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2887) today I would like to say that you know  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2889) the Quran makes it very clear and sorts  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2892) of room the thirtieth chapter and the  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2894) 32nd verse allah subhanaw taala has been  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2896) the ladina for a Hadiya home or kennel  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2898) she I pulled her husband female a day  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2901) him ferry horn and he also says in Surat  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2904) al so little an am in the one hundred  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2908) and fifty ninth verse if I'm remembering  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2910) correctly a very similar verse but then  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2913) he says to the Prophet the ones who  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2917) follow for dinner whom were the ones who  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2919) basically break away their the religion  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2921) less time in home fish a that you o  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2923) prophet Muhammad have nothing to do with  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2925) them these are two examples of actually  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2928) evidences from the Quran where the word  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2931) CI is actually being used explicitly  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2932) obviously it's not talking about  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2934) what we know is she has him today but  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2936) what is saying is because the word sham  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2938) means group insect what we're saying is  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2941) let's stick to the Quran and the Sunnah  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2943) and the Prophet that is what we believe  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2945) in right don't become a Shia or don't do  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2949) become a Shia in the sense that don't  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2951) become a group don't become a sect and  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2954) this is what not what I'm saying  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2955) this is what Allah is saying and as a  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2958) Muslim  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2959) anyone can anyone can identify with that  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2961) so this is really why the course I was

[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/_0SyGKXh-rQ?t=2970) terminology we just say that we're
