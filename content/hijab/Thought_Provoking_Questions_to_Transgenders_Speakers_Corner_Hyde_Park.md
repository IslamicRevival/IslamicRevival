[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=4) wearing to ask you know why I find  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=70) interested there's two reasons like one  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=73) or all of them is is split the feminist  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=76) movement so the feminist movement seem  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=79) to be divided on the idea of trans like  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=81) what to do in certain circumstances and  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=84) it's also split homosexuals like so I  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=87) feel like some homes so can I ask you  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=94) some questions because for me yeah  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=97) oh just trying are you friends let me  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=114) ask you a question do you know Wi-Fi  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=116) interesting consider the following  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=119) scenario because you know this is where  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=122) I find the contentious issues are the  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=126) sports out there like sports mixed  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=128) martial artists football even rugby lots  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=132) of sports where I think society has  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=135) agreed that one gender has a biological  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=141) do you agree with this all right so so  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=145) that so males having a biological  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=146) advantage over females exactly so now  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=165) let me put you in a certain situation  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=167) ask you guys a question right say for  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=170) example you have a trans like yourself  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=171) or actually let's make it the opposite  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=175) way yeah so you have someone who's a  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=178) male who becomes female all right all  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=183) right  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=184) would you protect that person's right to  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=187) say for example they wanted to  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=190) participate in sport obviously they are  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=192) allowed to participate in sport yeah  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=194) alright say they want to participate in  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=196) sport would you protect their right to  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=198) for example without man became a woman  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=200) too because they want to be identified  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=202) as women right that's it they want it  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=205) they don't want to be even known as a  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=206) man anymore  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=207) that's that's behind them right so so so  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=211) man yeah could they now participate in a  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=213) woman's side of it should they be able  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=216) to yeah okay now this is the thing  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=218) because a lot of feminists would argue  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=219) that they shouldn't and they'll swim in  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=222) this I'm not saying they're right or  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=222) wrong I want your opinion right those  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=225) feminists would argue that hold on  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=226) because actually this is where the lines  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=228) between what is referred to as a social  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=230) construction and what's the biological  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=232) reality become blurred because here we  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=234) know that testosterone is a is obviously  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=239) a hormone which is which which enhances  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=242) your strength and it enhances your  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=243) biological bilities right so if that is  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=246) the case if someone even if they've had  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=249) like hormone blockers and if they had  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=250) like the whole operation even if they've  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=253) had that whole system you will still  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=256) have an enhanced hormonal biological  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=259) advantage from a successful perspective  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=262) right so some would argue is just like  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=264) taking steroids yeah that like you're  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=266) not allowed to take stories in my sports  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=267) yeah so how would you ice it so they all  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=269) say look it's not fair for someone who  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=272) has gone through that whole  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=273) transformative process yet it retains a  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=276) lot of the biological advantage of being  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=278) a man to be able to participate in a  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=282) woman only thing like that in fact it  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=284) could be argued that if they do  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=286) participate that would be depreciating  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=288) from women's rights because women have a  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=290) right to fair contest right so can you  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=292) see the two sides so okay tell me how  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=294) you resolve it  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=330) so you think you think that the right of  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=333) that person to participate in the gender  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=336) of the of the chosen gender is Trump's  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=342) yeah and we don't like Trump I think  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=344) we're on the same side but it Trump's  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=348) the the advances that they make  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=372) Chipping they should be case by case or  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=374) something yes but you know what that was  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=376) suggested because if you if you if we  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=378) had it that way then you'd have some  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=380) women but the point is this  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=384) then discrimination will still exist  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=385) against transgendered people because  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=388) some people will be judged oh yeah this  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=391) guy's got all this this woman right has  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=394) too much testosterone her body so the  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=398) issue is here it seemed like a question  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=401) with no answer you see what I mean  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=406) it seems like a question with no answer  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=417) okay let me ask you another question  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=420) we must go another question now we have  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=423) boys schools and girls schools now let's  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=424) go become a little more easy right this  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=425) is easy you're Nathan Nathan I like your  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=469) thinking in a way yeah I like your  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=471) open-minded I'll be honest with you I  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=473) don't find your open-mindedness among  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=475) other transgender some are very militant  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=480) right I think your your approach is a  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=483) bit more fresh because frankly we live  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=490) that what you've said there is fair  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=493) enough  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=494) considering the circumcised let me tell  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=495) you why because frankly if we were  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=498) living and we're living it this is the  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=499) age we're living in now right we're  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=501) living in an age where it's very  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=503) possible for there to be some kind of  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=508) policy change where now because this is  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=512) one of the contentious ones like where  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=513) do we put trans I for example as  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=514) transgendered man at one point so  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=517) someone who's had a sex change and  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=520) become a woman yeah  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=521) at what point should they be allowed  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=523) into the room as toilet as soon as they  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=527) identify yeah okay let me ask I want to  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=530) get all of their opinions let me  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=550) challenge you on that right so for  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=553) example if I and it's difficult if I had  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=557) to do nothing could be some kind of I'd  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=559) have a serious advantage let's be honest  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=564) and it wouldn't be an easy operation  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=567) anyways the point is this if somebody  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=572) transferred from being a man to a woman  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=574) only by virtue of just actually saying  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=576) that okay now I'm a woman now yeah  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=577) you're saying that the point at which  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=579) they should be allowed into the toilet  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=581) is the point to which that they identify  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=582) yeah  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=586) are you LGBT as well what what does that  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=592) mean can you tell me no way  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=598) really yeah what do you mean by okay

[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=606) interesting this is well this one here  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=607) no you see this question of we'll put it  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=611) on the side for saying this gender  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=612) fluidity here I'm gonna actually  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=615) challenge your little girl name okay  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=617) let's challenge her on you know you said  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=621) some days you feel milk and some days  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=624) you feel female yeah okay  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=626) do you accept that do you accept that  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=631) notions of masculinity and femininity  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=633) are social constructs are you with me  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=641) listen to me carefully do you accept  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=644) that notions of femininity are social  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=646) constructs in other words you would  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=648) argue right that the idea of woman  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=651) preferring pink or the idea of women  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=654) being in the house or kitchen all that  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=655) stuff that's a social construct based on  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=658) the patriarchal society right okay you  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=661) accept this right ideas of masculinity  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=664) therefore are also socially constructed  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=666) okay you accept that yeah all right if  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=669) you accept that which by the way  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=671) personally I don't accept it completely  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=672) there is some truth in it some I don't  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=675) completely accept it but if you accept  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=676) that if you okay can you see my question  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=682) right my question here is gonna be how  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=684) do you define gender fluidity when  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=687) gender has lost meaning because there is  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=691) no such thing as if because if  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=693) femininity and masculinity are social  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=695) constructs then you can't say I feel  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=698) masculine or feel feminine because both  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=700) of those things are subjective value  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=702) judgments which are socially constructed  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=704) reality maybe is the case that gender  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=706) fluidity is a social constructed reality  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=708) how do you know that what you're going  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=710) through is not socially construct  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=716) how do you know it's gender fluidity and  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=718) it's not just homo loop in your mood  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=721) swings  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=722) that literally you feel angry at one  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=723) point and that you know how do you know  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=725) how would you also differentiate between  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=726) those things how do you know for example  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=730) when was it when were you when did you  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=731) feel man bleep what do you feel like a  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=733) man okay fine but what you say your  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=746) gender fluid yeah those days will you  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=748) feel like I'm like a man to put it  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=750) crudely obviously that has socially you  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=753) know constructed implications you gender  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=756) fluid as well are you gonna fluid okay I  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=758) can ask you both those days you feel

[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=772) mean what does that mean how would you  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=773) do stick with me stick with me because

[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=799) give me some things that you feel when

[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=844) man right  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=845) I identify as a man so I know how it  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=848) feels to be an experience  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=854) tell me what emotions we're talking  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=857) about here that those days you feel

[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=861) those things dim your emotion just one  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=871) now though a buyer is no wrong answer  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=873) this is the zero okay so let's get these  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=925) girls involved this all cuz I wanna know  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=927) if you share honestly I'm learning from  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=929) you guys don't take this I look like you  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=932) get me I'm just because I haven't met my  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=934) whole life I've met everyone but I've  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=937) not met gender food that's why I met  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=956) some people that claim to be like this  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=957) right but I never believed them right  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=961) my question is this  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=964) she was saying and I want her to pay  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=966) attention should I call you hurt him  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=969) okay that's cool then that makes it easy  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=972) for me  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=973) I called him see I need to change an  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=976) example listen because we're trying to  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=980) get to the bottom of something I said  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=982) like what is how do you feel when you're  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=985) like basically having your Matt mill day  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=986) so she goes things like I'll come into  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=988) more like male groups playing sports  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=992) will get more things like that so do  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=994) direct does that resonate with you a  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=995) little bit or what why do you feel when  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1006) you feel filmo or what you feel like  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1008) what kind of things you feel like Jack  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1009) what activities you do you ask an  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1011) activity what do you do  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1098) okay yeah when you're playing sports or  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1107) something yeah I've heard let's go  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1113) what's your call how much of you heard  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1114) of us at a feminist Ryan Agassi she  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1118) wrote a book and she was talking about  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1120) the things that women are inhibited from  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1122) doing because of them because their  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1124) physical breasts she mentioned that one  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1125) of those things is sports because of  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1127) their physical presence  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1132) I can ask another question do I am since  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1150) you got a gender-fluid on on a serious  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1152) level I had shown a scowl on understand  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1154) right now I'm in a position of  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1156) understanding your you're teaching me  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1158) you're the teacher and the learner I'm  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1159) the question I am the question is this  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1161) you know you say them that you feel like  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1163) you do gender-fluid you feel like I'm at  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1165) Mill would you go as far as I say and  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1167) there's no right or wrong answers to  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1169) short out your opinion would you go as  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1171) far as to say that we should be afforded  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1173) the right to participate of males like  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1176) for example sports or but you know what  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1191) I'm gonna ask you before basically at  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1194) what point should males that are having  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1196) because this goes back to the question  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1197) we had before were you were hearing it  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1198) when I said that if a male describes now  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1201) like he's not had the sex change per se  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1202) well now they identify themselves a  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1204) female should they be allowed in the  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1206) female toilets and most of you said yeah  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1207) it should be yeah you said I am so I  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1209) think okay so what's your opinion she's  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1214) saying yes she's very on about  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1219) are you are you trying to sir okay so  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1221) what Isis okay explain to me how because  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1224) it's all know you melt a few more fuel  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1244) okay can i play devil's advocate for you  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1246) guys later alright so someone could  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1248) argue that here if someone because you  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1251) let's I'm assuming your ingenuity I  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1254) believe your genuine yeah obviously  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1255) right what other people might not be  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1258) genuine like for example my man here  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1260) right okay I'm not gonna use example  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1263) okay okay my man here right you might  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1266) have this crush on a girl he or he might  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1269) want to just spy on someone right he  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1271) identifies himself as a female for about  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1272) a week  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1273) okay now no seriously this is a case  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1276) because if we're talking about you get  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1278) what I mean  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1279) so so so that person hasn't had the sex  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1281) change put on a wig or something  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1313) I recently had a boyfriend  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1350) but she feel like okay right you say you  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1362) prefer to be a man what does it mean to  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1365) be a man because you know can I tell you  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1372) something philosophically yes I will say  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1374) to you that I don't believe you yeah  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1378) fully I'll tell you why  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1382) being a man is a first-person subjective  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1386) experience okay you can only know how it  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1389) feels that like to be a man if you are a  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1392) man  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1392) biologically okay would you accept that  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1395) so if you felt because this is one thing  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1398) that we will talk about now because it's  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1399) the idea of and it's a philosophical  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1400) thing nature versus nurture right  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1404) naturally naturally we're born in  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1407) certain ways and that we have to work  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1409) out a sociologist or psychologist or  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1410) whatever is at one point at what junk  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1413) cha and do we believe that society has  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1417) had an influence on human beings  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1418) thinking the reason why I kept asking  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1420) you guys about masculinity and one when  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1423) you because you guys are gender fluid  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1424) and you you're obviously trying gender  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1426) yeah  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1426) at what point you feel like a man a  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1428) woman and you said okay well when I cook  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1430) I feel more like a woman when I play  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1431) football more like a man you said that  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1434) did you get me like I feel I want to be  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1436) I don't know what it is but  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1439) Wow it's just open I think it's more and  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1442) looking and like a feeling of life I  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1445) generally have really bad for me is my  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1453) weight but gender dysphoria for me is my  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1455) general  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1456) genitals I get what you're saying yeah I  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1459) understand this size with that but what  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1462) I'm saying to you is that this idea of  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1464) first-person experience is very it is  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1466) important that for example before I came  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1468) in today I was watching this thing  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1469) there's a robot a new robot called  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1471) Sophie have you seen the Sophie it looks  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1474) very go home and watch they weren't  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1476) Sophie right Sophie is one of the most  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1478) probably the most like interesting

[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1524) there a way that they could know how it  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1526) feels like to be like Sophie okay if I  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1529) ask you a question now let's go let's go  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1531) one step further if you have I'm not  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1533) comparing this before anyone says  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1534) anything I'm not comparing this let's  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1536) say for example I say look I feel I want  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1540) to be like a rhino  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1543) oh you know I did at one point when I  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1546) was younger when I was younger I looked  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1548) at I used to watch a lot of like animal  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1550) documentaries in there and I was  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1551) particularly fascinated with the lion I  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1553) know how to be any animal I'd probably  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1559) be a lion why because the king of the  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1561) jungle he's got the ability to tear down  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1564) his opponent you don't have to be as big  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1566) as them yeah and look at them lion it  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1568) looks beautiful man  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1570) well the question is could I ever know  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1572) how it feels like to be a lion park like  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1578) a lion so if I ask the people to call me  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1583) Lions H that's my name now lion H I want  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1587) to made this part of them but the point  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1593) being is this  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1594) at what point and this is a question  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1596) it's an open question guys you know I'm  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1597) saying I'm not trying to well I'm just  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1600) saying at what point does society  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1602) actually say but hold on that's how you  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1603) feel you want to be that's how you and  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1605) that is actually I'm not going to use  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1608) the word delusional at all right but  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1610) that is a thought process which is a  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1612) faulty cognition of some sort which  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1613) needs to be remedied so at what point  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1615) which we call it gender neutrality or  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1618) gender at what point do you guys think  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1621) yeah that it's actually more advisable  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1626) to remind this is my question do to what  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1631) at what point is it more advisable to  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1633) remind human beings of their biological  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1636) sex if any and if not then but does  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1641) biological sex have anything to do with  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1643) defining human beings as who they are  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1652) you get what I mean because it seems  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1655) that crop for me it seems I can catch 22  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1657) 22nd why if you say that okay  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1660) gender-fluid I feel man sometimes I feel  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1663) like woman you're born as a biological  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1665) woman I'll say that from your  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1667) first-person subjective experience you  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1668) can never actually feel how it is to be  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1670) a man unless you are a man right right  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1673) biologically biologically now if you say  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1676) no hold on because I feel like I'm  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1678) playing more sports in some days and  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1679) cooking Avenue right but then we could  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1683) turn around and say what hold on that's  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1684) the social construction of what it means  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1686) to be a man and that's a social  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1687) construction of what we to be a woman so  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1689) it might not be so same thing so someone  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1695) you get what I mean so that's why the  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1698) trans transgender discussion transsexual  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1700) discussion is actually a very  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1701) complicated one yeah unda liberalism or  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1704) under any other system obvious a  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1706) Laveau's level to get me so tomorrow is  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1708) really interesting because unless I  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1709) wanna profit there were men and that had  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1712) castrated themselves right and yeah yeah  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1714) and he you know he would treat with with  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1717) great respect and whatnot yeah but the  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1719) point is is I don't know you know that's  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1721) what we believe we believe in treating  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1722) everyone with respect however the point  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1725) is this transgender transsexual  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1729) discussion is it seems like from I'm not  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1733) even thinking about it from religion  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1736) perspective or whatever I'm just  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1737) thinking about from a sociological  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1738) perspective I'm saying it's very  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1741) difficult for us to assert that hold on  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1745) we should call this person X because  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1748) they they feel like X what actually  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1751) feeling like X is socially constructed  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1757) yeah quite dear  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1759) that so you group me like do but at the  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1762) same time obviously that's constricted  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/is61wp1w7-w?t=1764) to myself
