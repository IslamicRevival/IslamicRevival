David Wood challenges Muslims to a debate on the fundamentals of Christianity and Islam, offering a $1,000 prize. The Muslim claims that Scripture is insufficient to prove Christianity's truth, and Wood responds that the Bible is the only source of evidence for Christianity. Wood argues that Christianity's starting points are more reasonable than Islam's.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hax68VgkjuQ&t=0)** David Wood challenges a Muslim to a debate, but the Muslim refuses. Wood challenges him again, this time offering a $1,000 prize for a debate on the fundamentals of Christianity and Islam. The Muslim claims that Scripture is insufficient to prove Christianity's truth, and Wood responds that the Bible is the only source of evidence for Christianity. Wood argues that Christianity's starting points are more reasonable than Islam's.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hax68VgkjuQ&t=300)**  host challenges a Muslim man to a debate on who is the more compassionate figure in the Bible, Jesus or Mohammed. The Muslim man agrees to the challenge, but requests that the debate be held on different grounds, such as the morality of certain actions versus the teachings of Islam. The YouTube host agrees and sets up a debate between himself and the Muslim man on the morality of the Trinity.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hax68VgkjuQ&t=600)** David Wood challenges Muslims to a debate, but warns them that he is willing to debate all three of them on the same stage at the same time. Michelle Marie challenges David's assertion that Christianity is beautiful, but does not believe it is true. David responds by saying that if Christianity is the truth, then it must be beautiful, and that if Muslims do not believe this, then they are not truly Muslims.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hax68VgkjuQ&t=900)** David Wood challenges others to debate topics like the Trinity and tawheed, but ends up getting defeated himself. He admits he hasn't heard of the challenger, but argues that the challenger must have been a subscriber since the beginning.

[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=37) with you here David Wood is someone I  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=39) can clearly say a staunch enemy of Islam  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=41) to be frank Accord any different he's  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=44) such an enemy that he goes to the levels  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=47) of losing his dignity no it is it is  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=50) because if someone hates me knowledge if  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=53) someone hates someone so much if I can  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=54) lose if it causes me to lose my dignity  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=57) that means psychologically up here I'm  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=59) not trying to do personal attacks at  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=60) home and I'm just sayin who is this  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=61) person this is a person in another  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=63) interview which he claimed that he was a  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=66) business this person who wanted to kill  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=68) his father and I played the recordings  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=70) you can play for yourself you have some  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=71) crazy stuff now I decided to kill my dad  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=76) and I decided to do it in a brutal  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=79) fashion not a not a gunshot or anything  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=81) I was gonna do with a hammer when I  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=84) walked up to my dad I've got a hammer in  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=86) my hand and I hit him in the head seven  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=91) or eight times with a ball-peen hammer  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=93) and so I thought he was dead and I just  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=96) left he was a very problematic person  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=98) now in the image that you can see in  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=100) front he's dressed up as a woman now the  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=102) question that needs to ask is why would  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=103) a man dressed up as a woman unless you  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=105) want to be a transgender yeah oh like I  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=108) said before you've lost your dignity so  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=110) words even with such a man and the only  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=111) reason we're doing this is to further  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=114) expose him that's why now this the  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=116) reason we're doing otherwise I'm being  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=117) honest I don't believe this person  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=119) should even be debated because he has no  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=121) dignity there is some Christians that  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=123) colorsmart says in the Quran laces are  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=124) all Christians are the same so there are  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=126) some that I could handle we go to the  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=127) pass summit and a good people they talk  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=129) to us they want a reason they want to  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=130) understand and luck always wanted Isis  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=132) come to common terms between you and  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=133) them  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=133) but this man is not the same and he will  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=135) not be treated the same cause we're  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=136) gonna be very frank we're not here to  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=138) Haywood no no no no no we're here to get  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=140) to the point and deal with the matter  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=142) head-on  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=142) so since we've got a little bit of  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=144) understanding who is this person from  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=145) the images below he dropped you poor  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=147) challenge out to him you said to him  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=149) look they litter let's have a debate and  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=151) the videos that you reacted to was of  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=154) him not being able to answer a question  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=156) that he was posed from his religion  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=158) regarding a doctrine not side issues not  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=161) did Jesus have a yellow hair or blue  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=162) hair it was about Jesus dying and being  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=165) resurrected what was your challenges on  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=168) a reaction video of David Wood reacting  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=171) sorry you're answering attempting to  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=174) answer a question that was posed by  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=175) another Muslim guy in some conference or  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=177) some debate that was done and they were  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=178) very straightforward questions about the  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=180) personhood of Jesus Christ and the  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=182) doctrine of the Trinity yeah and what I  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=185) found shocking about those videos and  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=187) you can obviously refer to the other  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=188) videos I've done to see what I'm talking  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=189) about  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=190) well I found shocking about those videos  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=192) is that although the question was  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=194) practically very straightforward the  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=197) answer was all over the place and my  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=201) point there with with reaction to those  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=203) videos was that this man who has spent a  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=206) whole a jury of his adult life he  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=209) attacking Islam when it comes to  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=212) answering his own religion or trying to  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=215) justify his own religion he's not even  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=217) able to do so on a basic fundamental  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=219) doctrinal level he Ivan look at the  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=222) basics of his religion and make sense of  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=224) them okay so we did not show you put  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=226) challenge out to me I brought a  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=227) challenge out for him to talk about what  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=230) the debate question must be about the  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=232) fundamentals of both religion why why I  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=235) think why comma seats you why  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=236) fundamentally in order to prove anything  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=239) true or false  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=240) yeah we need to look at the first  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=242) principles of those things right in  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=243) physics and mathematics in philosophy  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=246) yeah the premise one of the best ways of  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=249) finding out if something is true or  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=250) false is what we call arguing from first  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=253) principles okay this is one of the best  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=255) if not the best way of arguing if not  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=258) the best way of ascertaining the truth  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=259) okay okay so when we argue from first  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=262) principles we look at the assumptions of  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=266) said the thing that is being supposed  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=268) yeah or that is being put forward okay  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=271) in this case I said what are the  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=272) assumptions what are the first  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=274) principles what are the beginnings what  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=276) are the epidemiological roots of  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=279) Christianity / Islam in both cases there  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=283) are different assumptions on the  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=285) personhood of Jesus Christ on God on  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=288) these on these key masses here so here  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=290) what we should be talking about is what  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=293) makes more sense from a rational a  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=296) textual and historical perspective does  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=300) the Trinity make more sense or does tell  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=304) he'd tell how you'd make more sense so  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=305) miss you do you see in this look forget  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=307) the branches and the leaves let's go to  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=309) the moon let's go to the roots yes well  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=310) well guess what well guess what yes he's  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=312) responded to the so Jesus see if he's up  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=316) for the challenge he seems I'm brief  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=318) that's it this one is actually not a  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=322) question for you but for some reason  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=324) that someone wants to post a video about  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=325) me because they keep my Twitter lit up  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=328) but David did you accept that the  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=331) challenge from that Muslim Dawa guy from  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=334) speakers corner police confirm or deny

[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=707) more clearly than that ladies and  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=708) gentlemen I've been affirming that I'm  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=710) willing to debate all day long and  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=712) multiple times over the past month so  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=715) anyone who asks go ahead and send them  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=718) back to that little clip right there yes  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=719) the answer is yes do you know what yes  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=723) to do now he has to sudden he has to  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=724) make a video yeah put my name in the  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=726) title yeah with your time and your place  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=729) like a beep says just send me location  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=733) just send me location all right okay we  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=741) have a question here from Michelle Marie  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=746) David asked him why he thinks  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=748) Christianity is beautiful but doesn't  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=750) believe it's the truth and just from a  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=753) from a philosophical note something can  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=755) be beautiful without without being true  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=757) right like like if that's being stately  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=760) I'm interested in that because you know  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=762) he's hitting out a true principle here  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=764) by the way I think company if you sit  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=765) down it's good I'm happy that he said  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=767) that because what it is is it shows the  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=770) he owns us he understands the difference  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=771) between aesthetic value judgment okay  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=774) which means looking at something and  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=776) deciding whether you think subjectively  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=778) is beautiful or not beautiful so so  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=780) laughter beauty is not an eye of the  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=782) beholder no everyone's gonna think  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=783) everything is beauty beautiful at the  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=785) same level right and that's why we  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=788) choose different maritals houses yeah  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=790) whatever may be right but what I'm  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=791) saying is that this is very important it  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=793) was it for me and you're just you two  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=797) what I was gonna say is this this is  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=801) very important because if you look at a  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=802) lot of his polemic yeah and all these  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=804) websites that talk about Islam and try  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=806) and answer Islam and these things yeah  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=807) when you look at their polemics their  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=809) polemics is this the argument is really  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=811) as follows yeah Aslam is violent yeah  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=814) therefore Islam is not the truth all  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=817) right if that's the argument then what  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=818) you're really appealing to is an  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=820) aesthetic value level always trying to  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=822) say that if you don't like violence  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=824) yeah you will not like Islam mm-hmm and  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=826) if you don't like Islam Islam is not  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=828) true exactly now really and truly as you  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=831) know yourself that does not indicate  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=833) truthfulness or falsity is that that  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=836) does not even if you're let's say for  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=838) the sake of argument right yeah you're  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=840) right yeah Islam has violence and all  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=842) these things absolutely no problem yeah  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=845) and it does have some violence yeah and  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=847) we're not saying that but the way he  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=849) represents it's not correct so for the  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=852) sake of argument the way you represent  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=853) it is true as well yeah yeah even if  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=856) that is the case it does not indicate  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=857) the falsehood exactly my point he knows  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=861) that he knows on a philosophical level  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=862) it's it's like you know what it seems  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=863) when they took him because this question  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=865) is to him this guy one is right here cuz  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=866) he said no Christians do so the lady  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=868) seen if you spew - why don't you become  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=869) a Christian oh yeah  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=871) so he is and he's basically gonna say  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=872) look I find it beautiful it's not the  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=874) truth I don't believe it yeah what is  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=876) seems with a lot of Christians is that  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=878) they won't got to be how they wanting to  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=880) be look if something is the truth if is  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=882) the Christianity is the truth and in  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=884) Christianity the God Almighty says every  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=886) first day Ali you're gonna climb up a  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=887) tree stay there for 20 minutes eat a red  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=889) apple come down and sleep I'm gonna do  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=891) it it's the truth I'm not gonna say I  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=893) don't want it it doesn't sound right to  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=895) me I don't like it it's irrelevant this  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=898) is the point what the reason why Muslims  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=900) do what they do where there is some  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=902) woman putting on a high job or a man  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=903) sporting a beard or doing whatever it  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=905) may be here it's because when you come  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=907) to accept the authority of is Latin yet  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=909) and the authority of tawheed Allah being  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=912) the one goodness that is commanding yes  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=914) the injunctions that are found in the  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=915) Quran and it's the truth and we can  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=918) rationalize that right then it makes  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=921) sense to follow those Commandments and  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=923) injunctions because that is the old  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=925) perfect truth if you learned Rania for  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=926) example on a practical level when people  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=928) go to doctors  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=929) they go to doctors because they trust  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=931) the authority of the doctor hmm I didn't  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=933) know that this person is qualified that  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=934) they're specialists in their field yeah  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=936) and therefore they so the point is this  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=937) rather than once as you said looking at  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=940) the branches of the tree right looking  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=943) at the prescriptions the injunctions and  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=945) deciding yeah yes by a sociological  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=948) analogy which is sometimes a very  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=951) sometimes a very weak logical way of  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=952) deducing things now okay this is not in  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=955) line with post-enlightenment idea  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=957) exactly and applying but therefore the  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=960) fallacies of present ism yeah yes this  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=963) is not in line this is not in line with  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=965) liberal values and this is not it's  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=967) something I'll do in the essay yeah that  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=969) we could would come to a conclusion if  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=971) this is true this is false  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=972) hmm this is of course a weak way of  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=976) finding out what is true my sauce and  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=978) I'll repeat what I said before the best  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=980) way of finding out if something is true  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=982) or false is by arguing from first  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=985) principles from a logical perspective  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=986) and what which is which is the roots the  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=989) roots of it trillion and tawheed I'm  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=991) going to end on this I found them he  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=994) just shot himself in the foot right he's  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=996) just answered a question where he's seen  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=997) just because something is beautiful  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=999) doesn't make it truth yeah I'm beauty is  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1001) subjective right hold on a second and  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1002) then he said he wants to debate Prophet  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1004) Muhammad and Jesus  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1005) what's it gonna debate on what's he  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1007) gonna try to prove him there which one  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1009) is more moral hold on a second you just  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1012) defeated your whole purpose you have no  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1013) choice but to debate the Trinity and  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/Hax68VgkjuQ?t=1015) tawheed David would I think it's night
