[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=75) Obama the country mr. McGarry Buddhist

[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=96) right now there's nothing fit the media  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=99) narrative gender

[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=102) sometimes being vegetarian  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=108) Muslims also very because you know you  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=113) can buy movies than anybody else that's  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=115) because the population of Muslims in  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=117) order the population of Muslims in the  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=119) world is quite heavy quite a big  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=120) organization like 4.1 right so when you  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=123) compare Muslims of juice for example or  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=125) Buddhists even it's a lot of fertilizer  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=127) because we talk about core of the  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=128) world's population comparison to the  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=130) state with the Jewish example less than  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=132) 1% of the world's getting light I'm just  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=134) asking why let's use of all of our  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=137) bribes where do I go how can you how can  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=140) you justify him we don't justify I think  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=142) you other thing we don't justify why do  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=144) I assume we justify understand how we  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=146) are the thing that made us into a  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=149) discussion I don't think it's a point of  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=151) showing I don't think you do I don't  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=153) think we disagree right you'll be your  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=155) primary premise was that you don't like  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=157) that you don't like you have been killed  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=159) unjustly I know you want people to stop  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=162) dying unjustly as well right  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=164) I'm not going to teaching okay fine  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=166) that's not very nice yeah but I'll tell  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=168) you the truth if you're talking about  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=169) Jesus I took about your sanity we have  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=172) to be also very fair I look at the broad  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=174) scale of history right and it will ask  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=176) me about why Muslims guilt okay so why  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=178) did Christians took Christian you know  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=180) you have Catholics and Protestants  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=181) killing each other it happens I have  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=182) Catholics not be here Oh telling you  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=185) okay that's why even though it is not  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=191) the same okay fine I do believe there  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=193) are five that's your position I don't  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=194) think it's the majority position right  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=195) okay well I'm going to say to them we  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=198) have to be consistent just because we're  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=200) looking at look at the rule data is what  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=202) I'm saying  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=202) yeah if we look at the war data will  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=204) come to the conclusion like let me give  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=206) you an example just suicide bombing as  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=208) one example when I say suicide bombing  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=211) what is this woman here what is she  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=213) envisage someone like me right let's be  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=215) honest what is mine a lever like  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=217) something inside of my you know I blow  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=219) myself up right because suicide bombing  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=221) is almost synonymous with Islamic  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=223) suicide bombers in it you would you  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=225) again it depends  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=226) for example regulated in Japan from  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=228) Comcast  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=229) nice one if you look at the war data for  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=231) example there's a book written by Robert  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=233) pay p.m. school dying to it he analyzes  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=236) from 1980 to 2005 all of the cases of  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=240) suicide bomb he said there's 315 cases  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=242) of suicide bombing on the international  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=244) level and we said that the number one  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=246) culprit of this where the Tamil Tigers  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=248) with 75 cases or 300 succeed then that  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=253) is then there's a range of other people  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=255) then the attack of suicidal and  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=256) conscious language yeah Tamil Tigers and  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=258) almost I've just posted on the coming  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=260) honey now the point is when was the last  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=262) time you put on BBC and you saw Tamil  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=264) Tigers over every channel for we saw  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=267) camels on wherever and Romania which is  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=270) it exactly my mother used in tonight  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=273) okay like me here we'll have something  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=275) in common  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=275) go online when was the last time you saw  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=278) camel tiger blows himself up when was  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=281) all family soil examine the reason why  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=284) you're not aware of these things that  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=287) are happening in the world it's because  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=289) you have not been made aware and that's  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=292) why in communications to inform eight  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=293) days when I talk about TV  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=295) one scholar of communication who said  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=297) that TV doesn't tell you what to think  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=299) but it does tell you what to think about  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=301) and that's what you have to remember I'm  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=304) not talking about TV the media as a  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=306) complex generally that's what it's done  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=307) if you look at that this is what my  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=309) point is here today my feed is as  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=310) follows if you look at the raw data of  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=313) things like suicide bombing of things  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=315) like terrorism you'll find that  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=317) comparative to their population  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=319) Muslims do not score overwhelmingly  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=322) disparate disparately  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=324) you know as a ratio higher than any  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=327) other fake people  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=328) in fact Noam Chomsky has written many  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=329) books about this his point is that if we  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=333) consider state terrorism in the United  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=335) States of America be the global world  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=337) leader  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=338) higher than Isis by the way hydrolyzes  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=340) the only one that can be is in barbarism  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=344) and laws and cruelty and all the things

[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=429) people that were on the cafeterias there

[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=434) the people rifle is doing the only thing  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=435) they can do which is try to educate  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=437) people about terrorism about Islam  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=440) everybody military Michael today it was  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=443) it's a community I do  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=445) I don't think in an essay and taking  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=448) this community  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=450) computer can I say something else Amelia  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=453) wake up listen let me say Donald fun  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=455) right you might not want to hit I don't  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=457) know but there's a lotta  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=458) okay religions are to blame after I'll  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=460) be the first one whatever the Muslims  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=462) articling  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=462) for many of the problem point one in  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=465) fact most of our problems are because  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=467) the Muslims themselves I'll say horses  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=469) normal a second  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=472) yeah yeah no this is better  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=476) number one most of the problems are from  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=478) living with us that's why the Quran it  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=480) says Allah does not change the condition  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=482) of a people until they change the  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=484) conditions of themselves so we believe  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=486) that the reason I personally will tell  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=487) you here the reason why you have so much  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=489) devastation the target the reason why  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=493) okay most of these things are happening  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=495) in the Muslim world it's because the  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=497) Muslims themselves have not internalized  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=498) Islam that's the problem a community  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=501) internalized there but they're not  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=503) embodying it they don't understand it a  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=505) lot of them Muslims are ignorant and a  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=507) lot of them are desperate so they have  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=509) problems we're not we're not justifying  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=511) I can see when they're probably the  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=512) point became easy yes he is and you are  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=515) behind I know my tailors welcome oh  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=520) thank you very kindly fishing no I'm how  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=523) could you say that complaining that okay  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=526) let me say this another point where I'll  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=527) be with you yes the Muslims are number  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=529) one if you if you had a blameless I've  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=531) put number one Muslims of the blade why  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=533) because of the nationalism of the  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=536) hanging each other racism of their  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=538) cultural package that they have the  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=540) problems that they have not  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=541) understanding their religion they need  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=543) to learn it to be a reform this is one  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=547) more thing within the religion I think  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=548) most mostly their young Muslims need to  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=552) go back to its learning there we go I go  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=555) back to that's number one point two here  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=557) I believe that the West has something to  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=559) do here I'm going to blame the West for  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=561) the time passed they look the truth is  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=563) if we look at the colonial  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=564) like in 600 in 1617 century up until the  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=568) 1930s when I can understand Africa this  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=572) was a period of colonial life you might  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=574) not realize this but we had European it  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=576) was exactly as a yes and we pensively  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=578) first came giving those things first of  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=580) all let's talk about the majority of  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=582) Muslims so this might be something that  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=583) my shorty right especially in the late  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=585) nineteen hundred and in the twentieth  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=587) century the majority of Muslims are on  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=589) the Ottoman Empire to win the British  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=590) Empire did you know that the way it were  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=592) there part of India and you know  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=594) Pakistan all these  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=596) the threats on my hands polynomial so  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=597) the majority of Muslims are knotted  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=598) ultimately in the 1900 the majority of  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=601) Muslims were under British rule a point  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=603) one point two you have to understand in  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=605) the kind of world map today you asked  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=607) why armors been killing each other after  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=609) these a reason okay look at Syria for  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=612) example it's one of the most it's one of  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=614) the most religiously diverse countries  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=616) and then remove them all you need say  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=617) it's practically you know what's  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=619) happening in Syria today happened in  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=621) Lebanon already in the 1980s there was a  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=623) ten-year war in Lebanon why because one  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=626) the colonial must have drew the line  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=628) yeah when they said ok this is going to  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=630) be serious she's going to be live long  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=631) what they did is they intentionally put  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=633) opposing factions in the same country  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=635) such that they would have to dispute we  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=638) are over sovereignty who's going to be  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=640) in charge and that's continued to happen  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=642) both in Lebanon and Syria that's why  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=644) you'll find most conflict in that region  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=645) and Iraq you something else  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=647) it was the lies were kind of alone but  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=649) something didn't happen get back to do  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=652) yes  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=654) the idea something's gotta be done  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=657) because really as you appear we'd be  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=660) like where's now do you think it is  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=662) grateful or your version and yet what do  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=666) you think you're attacking in Syria and  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=668) then but the thing is Europe in Europe  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=670) well luckily we're not to be in Europe  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=672) and absolutely working on every problem  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=675) after that we must after this  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=679) you know as far as we're concerned we  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=682) don't let people ask you that we think  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=685) that everybody have unclear adjourned  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=687) yeah everybody can do their religion  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=689) where they want and now is like ground  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=691) we're going to bring we learned all of  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=693) these refugees no problem we're not  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=695) winning with Christian if it's what we  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=697) do long day  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=699) all of a sudden we get wheels now with  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=702) now we're faced with it tourism okay  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=705) lemma to solve it let's go into custody  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=707) number three what you're supposed to do  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=708) right now if you ask the question how  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=711) comes of all of the European countries  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=713) if you look at the European countries in  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=716) the EU JAMA to give you could have done  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=718) actually research and I'm going to give  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=719) you the findings right here right now  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=720) yeah if you look at the European  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=722) countries things like the United Kingdom  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=724) obviously France did some sort of large  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=726) Muslim population you'll find that  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=728) terrorism usually happens in those  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=730) countries most desperately to all  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=733) comparatively to other European nations  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=736) why can I just imagine Satan do you  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=740) think it's possible that this right  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=742) initial McDonald videos about anything  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=744) Tigers an offer you can again will be  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=746) surgery yeah yes exactly so no I can  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=748) never tell you you're right  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=750) what they do is this faction that's  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=752) always been part of the Islamic kind of  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=754) kharijite the holidays have it they have  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=757) always been part of kind of the  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=759) community extremist right and they've  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=762) always basic let me put it this way I'm  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=764) you know in the plan I'm going to  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=767) simplify it you to the lowest core so  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=769) many and I'm telling you is having fun  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=771) but if you open up them you'll find  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=773) there's two kinds of verses there are  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=775) some verses that talk about peace and  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=777) there's some verses I'll talk about  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=779) fighting yeah okay how do mainstream  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=782) Muslims interpret these mainstream  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=784) Muslims what I mean mainstream Muslims  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=786) I'm talking about all of the  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=787) institutions in the world yeah so we  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=788) talked about even if we talk about  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=789) universities the university even laws

[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=794) the big university in the world which  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=795) have any kind of influence academic  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=798) influence have done one thing and they  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=800) denied it on on condemning you know  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=802) these action and they've interpreted a  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=804) plan  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=805) in a so-called peaceful way so what  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=807) they'll do these versus effective  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=809) version this versus like in the quran  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=811) verses from an edge in the delegates of

[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=869) easy version these two verses  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=872) mainstream Muslims Orthodox Muslims will  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=876) say that those verses are talking about  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=877) fighting we're dark  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=879) combatants that are fighting you for  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=881) example in the context of war and we  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=884) live as that those extremists they say  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=888) no since and this exactly do they sin  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=891) for example the British people has  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=894) pledged allegiance to its sovereign they  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=896) too are guilty of the same crime because  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=899) the government running everything can  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=901) finish you go what would you say to  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=903) prisons the highest percentage of  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=905) I think according to Tom Tom's gambler I  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=908) mean I've done research on this if you  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=910) include state terrorism as part of the  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=914) unit of analysis yeah then I would say  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=916) if you look at the drone strikes if you  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=918) look generally about what if you look  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=920) for Moore's 1945 one word in the end of  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=922) World War two through the Cold War and  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=924) into the yeah so I would say that  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=928) there's no doubt in anyone's mind if you  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=930) count the casualties and Esther have  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=932) been committed in North Korea in Vietnam  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=935) and Afghanistan it was that America is  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=937) the leading terrorist named that's my  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=940) opinion  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=941) and as long Tomsk is opinion and that's  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=943) what basic numbers it's not really yeah  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=947) yeah yes the feeling aside be right so  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=950) I'm saying that look now what Isis can  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=952) do what well they people they're doing  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=954) Ram whoever most right no more  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=956) strategies they're coming if they  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=957) continue doing what they're doing for 50  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=960) years they will still not be able to  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=962) even come close to the numbers that the  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=964) US have already set the bar so high the  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=966) thing is you look at Isis now and how  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=968) they've established their state that's  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=970) exactly how the United States is  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=971) understood say about 200 years ago all  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=975) right so they annihilated a population  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=977) I'll think you want to imagine like 200  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=979) years from now your great grandchildren  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=981) or great great grandchildren come about  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=983) and they say look I'm from Isis and you  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=986) say that's a substance say look how it  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=987) was founded yeah but you say now is that  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=989) the world has recognized as a state  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=990) we've gotten our borders now the United  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=993) States the parable of that is exactly  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=995) the same powerful of United States what  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=997) they have literally established a state  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1000) through genocide through going against  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1002) their treaties with the latest killing  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1004) the people there and then when they  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1006) established it now they believe in  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1007) something called manifest destiny which  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1008) by the way in political terminology if  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1010) you look at the politics design States  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1011) of America you'll realize that no  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1013) president whether democrat or republican  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1015) can be elected unless they believe in  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1018) managing sustenance why is it manifest  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1020) destiny is the idea of westward  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1022) expansion of the United States expanding  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1024) westward until they basically take over  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1026) the world an imperialistic concept that  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1028) amor politician in the United States can  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1031) get elected unless they believe it  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1033) this is Isis but only difference is they  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1035) eat chips and a Big Macs and they have  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1037) Hollywood and Isis they do it in a much  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1040) more direct and graphic and gruesome and  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1042) primitive way Isis took people on  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1045) crucifixion and this and that they kill  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1047) people Addlestone them these guys put  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1049) them on electric chairs and torture them  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1050) in a big in a big complex in Cuba no one  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1053) knows what's going on No  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1059) yeah basically they let me say the  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1061) reason yeah it depends on your  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1063) conception of human nature enough  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1065) philosophers and the alignment period  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1067) have grappled with this if you look at  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1068) Thomas Hobbes and all of them look the  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1070) majority of enlightenment philosophers  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1072) they start their philosophy of wise  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1074) human nature the majority of them they  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1076) say human nature is closed to evil okay  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1078) I wouldn't say necessarily that's  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1080) completely true if I say there's an  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1081) element of true tonight and the  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1082) parameter style Hema half would you I  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1084) was aware that God gave human being a  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1086) propensity to good and a propensity to  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1089) evil and generally in the internal air  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1091) behind chapter 96 of arises the human  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1093) being has a propensity to transgress so  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1095) because human being has all of these  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1097) vices that inhibit him from living a  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1099) self disciplined life where they can  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1101) just be content with what they have  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1103) power and you got all these things will  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1105) drive human being invariably to conquest  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1108) and to overtaking people as use  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1110) demeaning and subjugating and  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1111) subordinating it and that's the human  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1113) problem now what is problematic is if  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1115) the West takes this human problem and  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1117) changes the label and says this is an  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1119) Islamic problem that's disingenuous  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1121) that's what we can't tolerate it because  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1123) that would be saying okay the Muslims  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1125) are unique in your you're unique in your  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1127) murder  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1128) you're unique in your in your expansion  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1131) you can weaken distance at Yale say no  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1133) we are absolutely not unique in that  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1134) we're a big part of the world population  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1136) and we're literally sometimes can mimic  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1139) the same behaviors as other people of  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1141) other things I think  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1143) happily with icing on its back fine done  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1146) many most entities and I think I think  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1158) we agree here doesn't think if you can  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1159) store you don't get moments of silent  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1161) agreement and this is one of them guys  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1163) ladies and gentlemen I think here above  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1165) understood that actually we both agree  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1168) you'd say yeah that really when you look  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1170) at the statistic it's no use  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1172) falling into the foyer of the right-wing  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1175) extremists in the country and blaming  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1178) all of the world's issues really on the  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1180) scapegoat of Islam because if we do that  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1181) that's not going to deal with the  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1183) complexities in the nuances of the  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1185) reality of the world  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1186) what we're saying is let's take a step  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1188) back and look at the route numbers if  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1190) your answer is let me tell you one thing  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1191) right I was personally just looking at  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1193) something figures in The Guardian yeah  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1194) and they supported the ons Office of  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1196) National Statistics and they were saying  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1198) that terrorism and jet in general  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1201) actually know they have the mortality  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1202) thing and mortality like numbers in that  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1205) yeah how many people died from terrorism  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1208) according to the parliamentary report in  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1209) the United Kingdom about fifty if you  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1211) have made about sixty people died from  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1213) terrorism from 2001 to say about 56 60  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1217) people here now there I must say I'm not  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1219) saying this numbers negligible we should  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1221) forget by it's not only just an attack  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1223) on people might an attack on the nation  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1224) so we shouldn't say that okay  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1226) we should just put it aside but what we  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1228) are saying is this I went to a speed  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1231) awareness course but I was feeding my  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1232) I'll be honest with you like that and  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1234) then I was speeding on the highway all  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1236) right  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1237) three makes Peter are three them so the  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1239) guide instructor he came out and he said  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1241) you know desired Kingdom or border  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1243) countries it's one of the best in terms  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1245) of road safety and he gave a sort of  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1248) integers 1760 people in 2016 1760 people  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1253) that died on the road  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1255) 28 percent of them were most effective  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1257) okay anyway this is between what  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1259) statistic the point is you're more  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1261) likely by you know by maybe about a  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1264) thousand to two thousand percent and  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1266) this is a massive number you're more  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1268) likely by a thousands of 2,000 percent  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1270) to get run over by a car then you are to  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1273) be struck by services thank you  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1275) I think you look great why does it say  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1279) me sorry  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1282) well the thing is just understand that  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1284) Islam when we're talking about Islam now  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1287) is practiced in the Western you  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1289) countries like well we're in the web  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1290) yeah if a personal friend of mine  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1292) this belief doesn't happen actually a  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1295) lot of people they come into some  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1296) believers and they come into some  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1297) eccentric oscillation we as Muslims it  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1299) should be known we have no right to  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1301) compel that person to be what he seemed  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1304) to be a Muslim  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1305) we have no idea so in the context of the  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1307) United Kingdom and the Western stuff  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1309) there's no way anyone could say that you  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1311) would even force a person let alone kill  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1313) them for doing for doing something  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1315) against their will that's just a  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1316) fabricated thing that some people  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1318) because of Salman Rushdie in the case of  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1320) some Russian the Iranian electronica  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1322) against them they think they take that  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1324) too literally we have nothing to do the  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1326) Iranian regime so we would say that if  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1328) anyone in the West anyone in Britain  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1330) anyone in the United States anywhere  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1331) anywhere here then if they decide not to  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1335) be Muslim that not only do you have to  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1337) not hurt them or not compel them but you  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1340) also have to be kind to them and that's  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1342) our position  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1350) Jannetty and they just get like so many  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1354) people trying to captain I do with you  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1356) but you know what let me tell you  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1357) something liable like they might be a  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1360) lot of Muslims and I having done because  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1363) they mean are ready to land and to make  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1365) it you know the way Prophet Mohammed has  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1368) these revelations or any like his are  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1370) you sure wisdoms Ayodhya  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1373) and don't deserve why all of a sudden  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1376) our evolution density changes and it  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1379) gives to me a little bit efficiency fine  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1382) I can become like that perhaps I feel  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1385) the appalling a Muslim family fear  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1390) actually thing and actually I the one I  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1394) want to improve yes because they claw up  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1396) and lean on with a Muslim is so  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1398) community-based religious and I think  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1402) it's just just like in my favor listed  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1405) ok levitate something like I you know go  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1409) back to Noam Chomsky yeah I would not  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1410) mention no no you know a very famous  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1413) academic person live the kind of liberal  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1415) kind a we're having to think about Trump  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1417) no no no he's well-known English there  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1420) not only was it that he could he quoted  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1423) one of his books I come up which was for  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1424) now but he said that and by the way let  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1427) me before I call him I'll be clear that  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1429) I don't I personally I Muslims generally  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1431) don't see liberalism or democracy or  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1433) let's say anything as an ultimate truth  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1435) of any kind job there are making like if  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1438) you put yourself in diagrammed are  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1439) similarities on a practical level  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1440) between Islam of these ideologies but we  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1442) don't say that we don't see that this is  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1444) an objective truth in any capacity right  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1446) we believe only Islam is an objective  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1448) one fully truth okay having said that  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1451) we're saying here since we're playing by  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1453) the rules of liberalism awareness  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1454) liberal type country and most people who  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1457) would identify themselves as liberal  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1459) maybe not with a big L of a conservative  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1461) small L now what I'm saying here is he  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1464) said go Cisco if you don't believe in  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1467) freedom of speech for the people you  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1470) despise the most then you don't believe  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1472) in freedom of speech at all okay now one  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1475) thing if this is the premise that we're  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1477) working upon then not only do we have to  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1479) stand here in speaker's corner and talk  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1480) about the fact as liberals right and  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1482) once again I'm not a liberal but as  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1484) yourself and others speak about the fact  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1486) that okay  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1489) you know that you know that what you  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1491) call it the X Muslims have a hard time  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1493) yeah we also have to talk about the fact  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1495) that people that come into some of our  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1497) time  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1497) that's not the definite report because  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1499) it does not fit that media narrative  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1501) once again we have to talk about Muslim  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1504) minorities being attacked and prosecuted  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1506) you have to talk about legislation as  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1508) you put through on that issue level  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1509) exact discriminates against certain  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1511) secular finish your point well last  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1515) question what you think oh that's what I  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1518) was going to say all right why keeping  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1521) basically I think it's one of the best  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1523) countries in Europe  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1524) yes obably it's not the best out of them  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1526) I haven't been said we cannot open a  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1528) comparison of yeah only compares the  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1530) devil right it's probably the best in  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1532) Europe not considering obviously Turkey  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1534) Bosnia and these countries you trashed a  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1535) Muslim person I'm talking about the  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1537) Western Europe whom I know is probably  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1539) the best yeah and one thing is that  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1541) because Britain has a good is the most  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1543) morally consistent on a liberal level  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1545) country in the Western European  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1547) Hemisphere they should continue being  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1549) that way by disregarding and Prince of  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1552) the Flies  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1552) this is poisonous right-wing poison and  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1556) are coming and Ukraine being  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1557) increasingly for right you're ringing up  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1559) you know you keep the harmony right  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1562) really Christian yeah I present explain

[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1569) of it conservative Muslims amenable  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1571) example yeah right we hear quite a bit  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1573) well you can have extremes and  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/pMqpB4czMcA?t=1575) everything but you know what I just want
