[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=11) have to go to them alright let's go to\
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=13) the next one no you can slavery this is\
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=17) the horror of Abrahamic religion\
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=21) generally these are this is why we know\
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=23) these are in books were not authored by\
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=25) a moral genius the Bible in the Quran\
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=28) can't give you a basis to resist slavery\
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=32) take it away so this is this is really\
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=36) interesting because Sam Harris is\
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=37) actually written a book called the moral\
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=39) landscape and in that book called the\
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=42) moral landscape he writes in a footnote\
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=44) and one of the ending chapters I forget\
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=46) which type sure exactly but he writes\
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=48) and this is a kind of paraphrase of what\
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=51) he says he says that there is no\
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=52) neurobiological way of ascertaining\
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=55) truth and falsehood in other words\
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=58) objective morality according to sam\
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=60) harris cannot be ascertained on the\
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=62) atheistic materialistic worldview this\
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=65) is not just some Harris's opinion this\
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=67) is the opinion of Richard Dawkins of\
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=68) jacquees Derrida of Bertrand Russell of\
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=71) Nietzsche of most post modernist atheist\
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=75) philosophers that actually objects of\
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=77) morality cannot be ascertained what's\
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=80) really interesting is that on the one\
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=81) hand where they make this patently clear\
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=82) but there was no philosophical\
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=84) epistemological base for basically\
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=87) believing an objective morality\
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=90) they'll make arguments which are moral\
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=93) against religion and this is one of the\
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=96) arguments that they made so he makes he\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=98) says that the slavery and whatnot let's\
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=100) take for granted let's let's say for the\
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=102) sake of argument that he's right about\
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=103) this about slavery generally speaking\
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=105) even if he was completely right that\
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=108) would do absolutely nothing for the case\
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=109) of atheism and absolutely nothing for\
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=111) disproving Islam however he is wrong on\
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=113) that because of one very simple verse in\
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=117) the Quran which most of the children our\
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=120) children have memorized in so little\
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=122) ballads in chapter 90 of the Quran where\
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=124) simply says were mad at the rock amela\
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=126) ABBA FATCA Aqaba what do you know of the\
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=130) good way what would make you know what\
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=132) the good way is for\
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=133) being slaves is the good way his exact\
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=135) terminology was that there is nothing\
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=137) within or inside or outside of the\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=140) scriptures which allows for the\
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=142) resisting of slavery the Quran says very\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=144) clearly that actually were mad at the\
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=147) raka malapa\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=148) what would make you know what the good\
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=150) way is freeing slaves is the good way\
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=152) what he is saying because he is I\
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=154) believe theologically illiterate I don't\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=158) think he's actually someone who reads\
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=159) books theological books Quran Sunnah\
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=162) hadith and these things I don't think he\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=164) actually even looks at the Bible too\
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=165) deeply I think he makes sociological\
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=168) cases and generalizes them on the\
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=170) religion and that's very very much the\
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=173) nature of what he does he never close to\
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=174) Quran\
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=175) you'll never really see this guy quote\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=176) in the Quran sam harris sam harris\
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=178) doesn't really quote though I've never\
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=179) seen him I've never once seen him\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=180) quoting the Quran because he knows muddy\
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=182) water for him he's not trained on this\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=185) he shouldn't talk about this is he is\
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=187) what they call an ultra crapper darien\
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=189) his non-specialists talking about\
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=191) something which does not concern him\
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=193) he's completely talking about something\
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=194) which is out of his Lane when he does\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=196) the same thing with philosophies the\
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=197) same thing he's a non specialist in\
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=199) philosophy not specialists in theology\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=200) when he talks about both those matters\
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=202) as if he is an authority on those two\
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=203) matters so here he said that the the\
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=207) Quran and I'm also quite the Bible now\
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=209) but we're talking about the Quran\
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=210) specifically has there's nothing in it\
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=212) that would allow us to resist slavery so\
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=213) he would not be able to basically just\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=215) he would not be able to explain away\
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=218) that verse which is a non abrogated\
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=220) verse of the Quran moreover I guess what\
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=223) he's trying to say is because the office\
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=224) of the Quran which talked about what\
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=225) your right hand possesses and and these\
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=228) things in the hadith the various a\
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=231) hadith Nasir how it shows us that there\
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=232) were slaves at the time of the Prophet\
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=233) and we're not denying that that's the\
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=234) case absolutely there was slaves at the\
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=236) time of the Prophet we are saying that\
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=238) the object of office led the whole world\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=240) I mean the whole world at that time\
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=241) absolutely well slavery ended in\
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=243) American 1865 in in Britain in 1807 and\
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=249) you can that's legally once again if we\
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=252) take a step back and say what is slavery\
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=253) does it the international I think is\
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=256) called the International anti-slavery\
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=257) organisations they they actually said\
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=260) that slavery is defined as includes\
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=263) child labor human trafficking and\
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=265) prostitution let's\
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=267) these things if we consider these\
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=269) factors and we're very serious about\
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=270) those definitions and I would say I\
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=272) would claim that the West is actually\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=274) more involved and engaged with slavery\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=277) than any other part of the world and I\
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=280) think that now if you really care if you\
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=283) really want to make a difference since\
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=285) we live here that's something that's not\
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=287) talked about that's like our little\
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=289) secret America's secret that there are\
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=291) child sex slave rings in our country\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=294) right now up to three hundred thousand\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=302) boys and girls are sold in the United\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=304) States every year and many of them don't\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=307) make it out of the industry alive there\
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=310) are only 99 known survivors from the\
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=313) state of Texas in the last 20 years\
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=314) who've managed to escape sexual slavery\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=317) when we think of the most horrific of\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=319) crimes the ones so morally repugnant and\
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=322) Barbara you know the widespread ones\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=324) that make you question humanity it can\
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=327) help us cope to believe they happen\
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=328) somewhere else\
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=329) somewhere far away that's why this\
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=331) weekend's FBI prostitution sting and\
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=334) capture of over a hundred and fifty\
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=335) pimps was so disturbing over a hundred\
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=338) children rescued sexual slavery here at\
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=342) home how does it still happen right so\
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=344) now you want to go ahead and do some\
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=346) social good yeah Joe Rogan's just step\
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=348) up Sam Harris to step up while you men\
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=350) trafficking and talk about human\
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=351) trafficking that's happening right here\
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=353) in our backyard yeah but no you got to\
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=355) go talk about you know is that the other\
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=357) I point the finger that way\
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=359) so we don't have to really talk about\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=360) what's going on at home it's really\
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=361) interesting cuz Polaris said that\
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=363) Polaris is what I think is cool pilars\
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=364) one of the organizations they said that\
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=366) America's engaged in slavery the\
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=368) majority of people that they enslave in\
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=370) human trafficking human trafficking\
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=371) forms is that are actually people of\
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=373) ethnic minority descent so black people\
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=376) etc those people are human engaged in\
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=380) the process of human trafficking who are\
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=381) who are trafficked are actually people\
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=383) of ethnic minorities so they're actually\
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=385) oppressing minorities enslaving people\
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=388) going back to what we used to be doing\
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=390) the 1865 days and talking to us about\
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=393) slavery\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=394) it's lama's I would put this very\
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=395) candidly only on the record one of the\
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=398) objectives of Islam\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=400) is to do away with the institution of\
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=403) slavery the the mechanism by which and\
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=406) through which it attempted to do this\
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=408) which is what I was saying before was an\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=411) incremental gradualist method\
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=413) it wasn't an instant abolition and we\
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=415) know from history that frankly when\
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=417) abolitions are attempted just like in\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=419) this country when the abolition was at M\
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=420) state of alcohol people rebelled against\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=422) it very quickly if something as deep and\
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=425) as economically important as the\
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=427) institution of slavery is interwoven\
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=429) into the economic fiber of a society\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=432) it's not possible if we to pull the rug\
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=434) under someone's foot so in other words\
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=436) what Islam came with was an incremental\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=438) method using different things and of\
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=441) them as they can't because in sort of\
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=443) the touhou chapter of the Quran one of\
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=445) the there are nine things or eight or\
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=447) nine things that are mentioned in the in\
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=449) the verse which talks about zakat and\
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=451) one of them was well fed a club the\
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=453) people who is who are enslaved so in\
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=455) other words since the cat is one of the\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=457) five pillars of Islam and since the five\
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=460) pillar this particular pillar must be\
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=462) continued until the day of judgment we\
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=464) believe then the e there must have been\
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=466) a certain amount of money always\
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=469) designated for the freeing of slaves but\
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=472) of course sam harris doesn't know this\
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=474) another thing which is really\
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=476) interesting is chapter 24 verse 33 of\
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=478) the quran which explicitly says that if\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=482) at that particular time which is\
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=484) obviously not not applicable to us and\
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=486) that particular historical time period\
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=489) something called maquette Eber can be\
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=490) done no kotoba is where you literally\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=492) have someone who's enslaved and then\
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=494) they say to their slave owner they say\
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=497) to their slave owner I want to be free\
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=498) and I'll ransom myself okay that person\
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=502) is not a criminal that person is not\
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=505) someone who's done anything according to\
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=507) chapter 24 verse 33 and you can look at\
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=508) for example to fiddle Toby or other\
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=510) tempers here like extra Jesus's that\
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=513) explicitly say that there's an opinion\
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=515) that says and this is a strong opinion\
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=516) going back to the Sahaba and the\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=518) Companions the Prophet if this\
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=520) particular indentured servant because\
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=523) they're not really slaves in the\
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=524) colloquial sense because you think of\
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=525) slaves like racial slavery we'd never\
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=526) had died in Islam\
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=527) that's never been part of Islamic never\
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=529) never ever racial stuff is the Quran is\
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=532) very that's what people think that's\
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=534) they have in there that we're talking\
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=535) about indentured because at the time\
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=536) there was no prisons so these people\
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=538) were put into into homes and imprisoned\
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=541) as if it was a prison right\
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=544) so that particular person if they demand\
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=546) yeah if they demand from the the slave\
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=549) owner to be freed then according to the\
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=552) Philip or Toby\
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=553) and according to the sahaba that are\
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=555) related by this stuff's here they must\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=559) be freed even if the the slave owner or\
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=561) you can say the the the the the one\
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=564) who's the prisoner the the one who's\
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=566) imprisoning this indentured servant\
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=567) declines it this person can go to\
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=569) Accardi can go to a judge and and\
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=572) forcefully be be liberated or\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=577) emancipated so in other words islam I\
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=580) would argue is the only ancient system\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=583) which allowed for the freeing of people\
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=588) which were either slaves indentured\
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=589) servants or otherwise there's nothing\
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=592) else in the history of man that went out\
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=595) of its way in order to get people out of\
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=596) the shackles of slavery and into and\
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=599) emancipated generally speaking whether\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=600) it be Muslim or Muslim what comes to my\
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=603) mind is it is a turban hadatha was it am\
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=607) I saying the right name where when he\
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=608) was freed and then he had a chance to go\
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=612) back to his father to his family he\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=616) chose to stay you know out of the love\
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=619) you know out of the love that he had for\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=623) Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=625) upon him yeah so you have a when you put\
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=627) yourself when you take yourself living\
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=629) in today's 2018 today's age right and\
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=634) then you take your back yourself back\
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=636) 1,400 years ago when the whole world\
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=638) everybody is a muslin slavery day\
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=639) absolutely medicine then Islam came to\
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=642) free the necks of the slaves right\
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=644) so if Islam just came and said it's late\
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=647) a slavery is erratic you wouldn't work\
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=648) it wouldn't work you got people invested\
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=650) with millions hundreds of millions of\
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=652) dollars you know in slave business\
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=654) absolutely but then what you're saying\
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=656) here is now if I'm correct now in every\
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=659) which way you turn and you just made the\
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=661) road that now it penetrated the hearts\
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=665) yeah so people gave\
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=667) is up absolutely from the love of their\
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=669) heart absolutely not like that it was\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=671) forced in this country and to this day\
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=672) people are like these people should be\
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=674) slaves right and you have all this\
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=676) racism is this yeah but there are\
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=679) certain situations where people will be\
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=681) forced to free slaves for example in\
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=683) Islam if someone had sexual intercourse\
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=686) with their wife in Ramadan they have to\
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=688) free a slave if someone does the harm\
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=690) which is mentioned in chapter 58 of the\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=692) Quran which they call their wives that\
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=693) they say they you're not you're\
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=695) basically not you're like my mother in\
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=697) other words you're not sexually\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=698) compatible with me or something it's a\
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=699) very specific kind of insult free after\
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=701) free slaves yeah if they did if they\
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=703) didn't off you have to free it so\
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=705) there's so many things in Islam which\
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=707) you're forced to free slaves if you do\
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=709) certain things then these slaves also\
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=711) slaves when I come governors then they\
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=713) become scholars they become like\
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=715) absolutely had people of high prestige\
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=717) people will not understand this but some\
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=720) people and because we just said that for\
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=722) example if someone was enslaved or an\
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=725) indentured servant don't you serve in\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=726) there literally whatever yeah that's\
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=728) what they were they were indentured\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=729) servants if they were in in the house of\
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=732) someone who was imprisoning them and\
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=734) they had the rights over them and I say\
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=735) and they decided that they wanted to do\
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=738) more kata by which is this basically\
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=741) it's a ransom their ransom ransoming\
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=743) themselves they want to be freed and\
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=746) they had that opportunity and they\
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=748) didn't take it the question is why would\
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=749) those people don't take it a lot of the\
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=750) the particular slaves at that time I\
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=752) would mention servants they didn't take\
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=754) the opportunity because they they were\
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=755) getting free accommodation yes now\
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=758) that's why a lot of them continue to be\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=759) Malik like the Mamluk Empire was\
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=762) actually the Mamluks there was two men\
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=764) blocks one in Egypt and one in India but\
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=766) the ones in Egypt and in India both of\
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=768) those was work work of a slave car or a\
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=770) tribe or slave a socio-economic grouping\
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=774) so they were socioeconomically the\
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=777) lowest of the low yet they were made\
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=778) into the highest of the high\
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=780) mm-hmm so it's not the same as the\
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=783) Western experience a lot of people think\
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=784) they generalize history say ok what will\
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=786) happen to the transatlantic slave trade\
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=788) where you had black people shift over in\
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=790) West Africa yeah that's the same thing\
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=792) as well as levers not ok before we go to\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=794) the next one people are automatically\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=796) automatically gonna see what's going on\
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=798) with this insane state right they use\
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=800) these\
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=800) range elements and then some things in\
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=804) Libya yeah what do you say to that I say\
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=806) to that I mean it's really really\
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=808) interesting the AI is is aa McStay we\
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=812) shouldn't call it that we should call -\
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=813) or something that whatever they want to\
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=814) call themselves but the insane stay in\
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=816) state that sounds good and saying hey\
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=818) those particular individuals first and\
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=821) foremost I've never seen such an extreme\
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=824) fringe in my whole life to the extent\
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=826) whereby I watched an interview in Arabic\
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=828) with one of the Mogul dimensions their\
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=832) names but they let's say they're of the\
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=834) same ilk as Osama bin Laden right they\
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=837) of the same ilk meaning they have the\
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=838) same kind of they believe in the same\
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=840) things and one of their leaders said we\
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=845) don't consider this is actually said he\
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=847) said we don't we call we call this group\
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=851) back to Allison ole Jamar\
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=854) so they don't consider them Sunni\
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=855) Muslims some scholars don't consider\
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=858) this particular faction is called\
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=860) \[ \_\_ ] Muslims some scholars have said\
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=862) that at all so that's one thing those\
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=867) people have said that they don't go\
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=868) there enslaving and this is what this\
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=870) person said in the interview they're\
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=873) enslaving their women so in other words\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=876) that particular is another faction in\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=878) the Syrian war which is let's say\
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=879) associated with extremism that other\
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=883) faction was associated saying the person\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=885) is in charge of that faction that there\
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=888) is slaving our woman what does that show\
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=891) it shows actually to be frank that no\
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=894) one sees these people as doing something\
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=896) in line with Islam not even Osama bin\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=898) Laden himself and I'm saying this on the\
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=900) record not even him and we know that\
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=902) what he stands for and all that kind of\
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=904) stuff is completely against mainstream\
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=905) Orthodox Islam according to all of the\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=907) institutions of Islam but not even he\
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=911) would see what they're doing is in line\
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=912) with Islam mm-hmm absolutely not yeah I\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=916) could mention names and all these kind\
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=918) of things but we won't go into that\
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=919) longer discussion but the point is this\
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=921) is such a fringe element of Islam that\
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=924) it's really not worth mentioning as a\
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=926) point of reference\
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=927) yet some Harris consistently mentions it\
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=930) as some kind of point of reference is\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=932) academically disingenuous because\
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=934) frankly\
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=934) there are institutions in Islam and this\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=936) I'm a quote all of the institutions you\
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=938) know one thing has reunited all of the\
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=940) Muslims against them is Isis there's\
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=945) nothing that I have United all the\
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=946) Muslims against them more than Isis has\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=948) but they still pretty bring up this\
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=950) fringe element every Muslim early drinks\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=952) yes every Muslim organization from India\
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=956) to Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Saudi air to\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=959) all of these in Mauritania all of the\
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=962) centers of intellectual power in Islamic\
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=964) world which is not even familiar with\
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=966) I'm sure Sam Harris is not familiar with\
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=967) those places and those institutions all\
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=969) of them have categorically condemned\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=973) Isis all of them so this there is a\
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=975) consensus on this issue yeah and yeah\
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=978) he's using it as an example so you're\
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=980) actually disregarding all of the\
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=983) institutional what he would call fatwas\
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=986) religious rulings and verdicts of\
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=988) everybody in the Muslim world all of any\
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=991) scholar wealth is you know any scholar\
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=994) in the Muslim world has said the same\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=996) thing yeah so how can we ignore all of\
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=999) that and say okay well these these\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1000) disband of people and Libya the same\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1003) thing is obviously in Libya and things\
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1005) have the same ideology Libya there's\
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1006) Isis in Libya so we're killing two birds\
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1008) want some of this because frankly the\
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1010) ISIS ideology is so far removed from\
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1012) mainstream Islam that absolutely\
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1016) everybody has condemned them yeah I\
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1018) don't see how he that has flown above\
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1020) his head they kill more Muslims\
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1022) absolutely yeah they actually have done\
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1024) more harm than any to Muslims myth\
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1026) before we go to the next point I mean\
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1028) there was an FBI released some data\
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1031) talking about that the book that most of\
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1035) them were found carrying with them was a\
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1038) showing how ignorant of Islam this group\
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1041) the insane state is of Islam yeah a\
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1043) dummy's guide for understanding it's\
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1045) like yeah so this is a you know really\
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1048) bizarre when you hear these things where\
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1049) people are just tuning in and they're\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1051) wondering we got our reso vaq jujitsu\

[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1067) important topic\
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1068) because of against once again these\
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1070) things helped fuel the division they\
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1074) helped feed into the hate the\
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1075) misunderstanding and that leads to the\
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1077) violence we've seen a lot of it we can\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/Hl7mPkjE8pI?t=1078) discuss that more towards the end FLE\
