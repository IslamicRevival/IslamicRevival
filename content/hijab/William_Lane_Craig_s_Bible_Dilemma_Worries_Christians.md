 "William Lane Craig's Bible Dilemma Worries Christians" discusses the problem of contradictions in the Bible and how they can be interpreted allegorically. Craig argues that even if one goes allegorical, they still have the problem of contradictory metaphors.  discusses the difficulties Christians face when trying to reconcile two contradictory metaphors in the Bible.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3uKsG31xWI&t=0)** William Lane Craig argues that the author of Genesis did not intend for the book to be taken literally and that there are inconsistencies between chapters 1 and 2 that suggest an allegorical interpretation. He also admits that this is important because it shows that the book was not written by a god who was concerned with making things consistent.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3uKsG31xWI&t=300)**  "William Lane Craig's Bible Dilemma Worries Christians" discusses the problem of contradictions in the Bible. Craig points out that the rabbis, an ancient Jewish scholar, understood the Bible to be understood in a literal way, and that they probabilistically problematized inconsistencies in its verses, but did not allegorize it. Second, the video discusses the cosmology of the ancient Hebrews, which was a flat earth cosmology. The third point is that the ancient Hebrews used the word "hug" to teach that heaven and earth were like two metal plates, and that through allegorization certain mystical truths could be indicated. However, Craig argues that even if one goes allegorical, they still have the problem of contradictory metaphors.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3uKsG31xWI&t=600)* Discusses the difficulties Christians face when trying to reconcile two contradictory metaphors in the Bible- "a plant has not yet sprung up" and "the thing is, if we continue and we ask another question, if you do go allegory on this and become an allegorizer of this what would stop you from using this allegorization approach in things which would be named or understood to be the main tenets of Christianity?" Origin of Alexandria, an apologist who was a non-Christian at the time, used an allegorization approach to at least do away with some aspects of the crucifixion which may be anti-logic. This shows that you can use this hermeneutical principle to wipe away the basic tenets of Christianity. Augustine, an early Christian theologian, was aware of the various exegetical approaches to the Bible and chose to allegorize parts of the Genesis narrative in order to meet the apologetic criterion. If one wants to say that the Genesis narrative is literal, they would have to maintain that Augustine was wrong and that the biblical discourse is against the most sophisticated cosmologies of his time.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3uKsG31xWI&t=900)**  William Lane Craig discusses the Bible's contradictions and how Muslims would view them as evidence that the book is not inerrant. Craig also provides an article proving the Islamic faith to be true, which provides additional evidence against the Bible's reliability.

[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=18) of contradictory metaphors

[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=39) dr william lane craig is a premier  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=42) season debate and apologists in the  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=44) christian world a scholar somebody who's  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=46) gone through the academic group  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=47) published many books  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=48) many many books in fact is almost uh 70  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=51) years old i think if not  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=53) he has passed that age so he's almost  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=54) double my age as somebody who's debated  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=57) some prominent figures from the atheist  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=58) community from even within his own  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=60) christian community and someone who  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=62) contributes and has done so  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=64) to the public discourse for i don't know  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=67) the last 30 40 years  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=69) what i'm going to be refuting him on is  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=71) his stance  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=72) on this genesis narrative in particular  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=75) and what he thinks  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=76) of it first of all let's take a look at  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=78) what he says in response to a question  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=80) that somebody asks from the audience and  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=82) then come back and comment on this  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=83) the first one the bible says god created  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=87) the earth  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=88) in seven days how does the big bang  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=91) theory fit  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=92) into this the big bang theory would be  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=95) incompatible with a literalistic  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=99) interpretation of genesis chapter 1. an  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=101) interpretation that  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=103) takes the days to be consecutive 24-hour  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=106) periods of time  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=108) however since the time of the church  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=110) fathers such as augustine  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=113) up until the present century most  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=116) biblical scholars  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=117) don't adopt that sort of literalistic  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=120) interpretation of the opening chapter  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=122) of genesis and i say that not on the  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=125) basis of modern science but on the basis  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=128) of the text itself there are indications  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=130) in the text itself that the author  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=133) didn't intend this to be taken in a sort  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=135) of wooden literalistic  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=136) way and so someone like saint augustine  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=139) for example  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=140) knew nothing of modern cosmology or  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=142) geology  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=143) um but didn't take this in a  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=145) literalistic way and i  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=146) i think that that is correct i would say  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=149) that  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=150) there are many different non-literal  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=154) ways of construing genesis 1 that are  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=156) open to biblically  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=158) faithful christians today and that are  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=160) wholly consistent and consonant with the  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=163) data of modern cosmology so as you can  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=165) see there  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=166) what we saw is william lynn craig  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=168) answering the question very frankly  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=170) he thinks that the approach that should  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=172) be applied  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=173) the hermeneutical approach is an  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=174) allegorical um or  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=176) allegorizing approach to the genesis  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=178) narrative or the creation narrative in  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=180) particular  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=181) when i looked into his website this is  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=183) what he had to say  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=185) as the reason why he does so this is  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=188) what he says he says  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=188) the author of genesis seems utterly  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=191) unconcerned  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=192) to iron out the inconsistencies between  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=195) chapter one and chapter two  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=197) that commentators have struggled with  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=199) for centuries  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=200) he does not seem to care that they're  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=202) inconsistent  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=204) an attitude suggestive of an intended  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=207) non-literal interpretation when he goes  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=210) on to  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=211) explain why he speaks about the fact  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=214) that in genesis chapter 1 that  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=218) you know the the plant had been created  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=220) on the the third day  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=222) in genesis chapter 1 verse number 14 or  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=225) verse number 12  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=226) and in genesis chapter 2 verse number 5  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=229) that no plant has sprung up yet  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=232) so he admits this is so telling and this  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=234) is extremely important  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=237) william lane craig one of the premier  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=239) apologists and scholars of the christian  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=241) world  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=242) admits candidly to one of the people  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=244) that are asking him  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=246) that there are contradictions in the  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=248) bible he admits that because of those  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=251) inconsistencies and contradictions that  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=253) there must be an allegorization  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=256) approach that is applied hermeneutically  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=258) to  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=259) the genesis creation story this is  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=262) extremely  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=263) important why because not just the fact  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=266) that it's mentioned in the quran  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=268) that if this book had been other from  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=270) other than god that would have been  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=272) left and kathira they would have found  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=274) in it many inconsistencies  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=276) but just a logical principle that if  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=279) something is true it has to fulfill  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=282) the basic criterion of consistency now  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=285) that is depending on or even if  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=288) one is depending on a coherentist  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=291) understanding of truth  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=292) and not necessarily a correspondence  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=295) theory understanding  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=296) of truth where truth must correspond  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=298) with the objective world  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=299) because one could ask a very important  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=301) question the question  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=303) someone may want to ask is why would you  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=306) have  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=307) or what use would there be of a  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=311) contradictory set  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=312) of metaphors in the bible because  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=315) they're saying it's metaphorized but why  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=317) should you have any kind of  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=318) contradiction anyway even if you have  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=321) metaphors that contradict each other  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=323) what function do they serve and does  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=326) this not  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=327) not meet unfortunately the basic  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=330) criterion for truth in so much as  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=333) it is inconsistent so this is the first  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=336) thing that you have a real hermeneutical  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=338) problem  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=339) on your hand the second thing which is  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=341) extremely  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=342) important is the fact that he stated  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=345) that the church fathers  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=347) the church fathers were allegorists  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=351) in the same way well if you really think  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=354) about it  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=354) you had an ecumenical writer or an  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=357) ecclesiastic writer origin of alexandria  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=359) who was very clear  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=360) in his allegorizing of these narratives  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=364) but the question is  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=365) why did he allegorize these narratives  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=367) and very similar for the to the reason  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=369) that craig employs he allegorized it  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=372) because  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=373) it was unintelligible if understood  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=375) literally  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=377) so before i get to that i want to take  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=380) one step back  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=381) and i will be quoting lots of  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=383) information here to prove these points  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=386) the first thing is the rabbis  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=389) in the what you call the mid rashem the  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=391) tafseer the exegesis of the bible they  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=394) all understood this  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=395) the bible to be understood in a literal  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=397) way i'm reading for example  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=400) this is the midrashim okay  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=403) and so this is what's mentioned in the  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=404) midrashim it was taught the light  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=407) which was created in the six days of  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=409) creation cannot illumine  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=411) by day because it would because it would  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=413) eclipse the light of the sun  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=415) nor by night because it was created only  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=417) to illumine by the day  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=418) then where is it is it stored up for the  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=421) righteous in the messianic future as  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=423) says moreover the light of the moon  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=425) shall be the light of the sun  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=426) and the light of the sun shall be  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=428) seven-fold the light of the days  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=430) and this is uh in isaiah chapter 30  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=433) verse number 26  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=434) and then the person who's executing this  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=437) who's a rabbi he says seven surely there  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=439) were only three since the libernaries  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=440) were created on the fourth day  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=442) so they problematized the  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=444) inconsistencies that were in the bible  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=447) but they did not allegorize the biblical  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=450) text  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=451) something different to what william lane  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=453) craig did okay this is very important  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=455) they prob  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=455) they problematized it but they did not  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=457) allegorize it  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=459) the second thing is this is their  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=460) cosmology the rabbi's cosmology in the  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=463) exegesis  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=464) they say the thickness of the firmament  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=466) equals that of the earth  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=468) compare it it is he that sitteth above  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=472) the circle of the earth isaiah 40  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=475) 22 and he walketh in the circuit of the  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=478) heaven  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=479) job chapter 22 verse 14 the use of  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=482) hug in both verses teaches us they are  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=484) like so this is how the rabbis  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=486) understood it  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=487) this is one of the main  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=491) exegetes of the old testament a jewish  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=493) exegete of course  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=495) said in hanina's name  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=498) it is as thick as a metal plate all  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=501) right so these are like two metal thick  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=502) plates obviously this shows that their  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=504) cosmology was a flat earth cosmology  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=506) and that they were two like a sandwich  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=509) you know the heavens and the earth acted  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=511) like a sandwich  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=513) okay two thick plates above each other  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=518) like two fingers they say in thickness  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=520) so this clearly cannot mean  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=522) that the earth is round as some have  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=525) tried to use  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=526) uh isaiah 40 22 to indicate  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=530) now what origin as we mentioned before  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=533) mentions  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=534) is he mentions the same thing so he  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=536) problematizes  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=538) the inconsistencies in the verses but he  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=540) doesn't just stop there he allegorizes  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=542) it as a result of that problematization  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=544) so it says now what man of intelligence  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=546) will believe that the first the second  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=547) and the third day existed the evening in  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=549) the morning existed without the sun the  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=551) moon and the stars  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=552) and the first day if we may so call it  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=555) was even without heaven i do not think  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=559) anyone will doubt that these things are  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=560) made by scripture in a figurative manner  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=563) in order  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=564) that through them certain mystical  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=566) truths may be indicated  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=567) of course now the problem is you've got  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=570) two  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=571) options option one go literal and then  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=574) this is completely against science as  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=576) william lane craig himself knows  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=578) because you'd have to say that the  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=579) universe was created in six 24-hour days  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=582) and that is six thousand years old  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=584) or you go allegorical and if you go  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=586) allegorical  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=587) you've still got the problem of  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=588) contradictory metaphors the like of  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=590) which  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=591) was described by me beforehand namely  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=594) that you have the fact that the plants  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=596) were created for example in the  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=598) in the third day and in genesis chapter  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=600) two verse five no  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=601) plant has sprung up yet so you still  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=603) have these contradictory metaphors  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=605) now the thing is if we continue and we  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=607) ask another question  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=610) if you do go allegory on this and become  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=613) an allegorizer of this what would stop  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=616) you  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=617) from using this allegorization approach  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=619) in things which would be named or  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=621) understood to be  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=622) the main tenets of christianity so look  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=626) at what  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=627) origin of alexandria replied or how he  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=629) replied  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=631) when he was asked about  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=634) the crucifixion by celsus an apologist  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=636) who was a non-christian at the time he  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=638) said the events recorded to have  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=639) happened to jesus do not  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=641) possess the full view of the truth in  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=643) the mere letter and history for each  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=645) recorded event is shown to be a symbol  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=647) of something else  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=648) by those who read the scripture more  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=650) intelligently  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=651) so because celsius was interrogating him  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=654) on how could it be the case that a god  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=656) can die on a cross  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=658) if he's so powerful origin of alexandria  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=661) used an allegorization approach to at  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=664) least do away with some aspects of the  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=666) crucifixion  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=667) which may be anti-logic and this shows  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=670) you  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=670) that you can use this hermeneutical  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=672) principle to  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=674) wipe away the basic tenets of  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=676) christianity  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=678) so he mentions william lane craig  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=680) mentions  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=682) that augustine okay he allegorizes the  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=685) bible  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=686) and he mentions the church fathers and  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=688) this is actually deceptive type of  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=690) academics  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=690) because it's not the case that the  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=692) church fathers by and large  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=694) that they did this theodore and diodor  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=698) they saw that the um  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=703) that the interpretations of the bible in  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=705) genesis should be read literally  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=708) for example eusebius  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=711) john of christos jerome  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=715) and others who have we still have their  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=718) kind of  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=719) writings on their attitudes towards  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=721) origin especially in his allegorization  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=723) they didn't take the view of  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=725) allegorization so if you wanted to have  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=726) a general  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=727) and you wanted to have a rule the  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=729) general will be the literal  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=730) interpretation not just for  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=732) the rabbis who executed the bible but  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=735) also the bulk  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=736) of the church fathers who um  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=739) who exegeted the bible the rule would be  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=742) origin of alexandria who was not even  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=745) canonized in the church of the catholics  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=747) but having said that of course you have  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=749) a problem if you go with this  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=750) allegorization approach  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=752) or valid origin of alexandria then you  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=754) could be wiping away  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=756) the central tenets of christianity  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=759) why did august in the question is  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=760) because he mentions augustine why did  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=763) augustine why did he decide to  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=767) if he did because there's different  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=769) readings of it but let's assume that he  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=771) allegorized parts of the genesis  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=773) narrative though of course we must note  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=774) that he  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=775) named his book a literal interpretation  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=777) of genesis  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=778) and he had two such exegesis  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=782) why did he allegorize it so if we look  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=783) here there's something about the earth  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=786) the the heavens and other elements of  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=787) the world about the motion of the orbits  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=789) and stars  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=790) and even their size and relative  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=791) positions about the predictable eclipses  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=793) of the sun and the moon  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=794) now it's disgraceful and dangerous thing  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=796) for an infidel to hear a christian  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=800) presumably giving a meaning of the holy  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=802) scripture talking nonsense on these  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=803) topics  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=804) we should all um take all means to  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=807) prevent such an embarrassing situation  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=809) in which people  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=810) show up vast ignorance in christians and  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=813) laugh  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=814) to it it to scorn so he's doing it for  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=817) apologetic reason  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=818) reasons he was very aware of and this is  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=821) mentioned in david lindbergh's book on  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=822) these issues  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=823) he was very aware that the biblical  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=826) discourse was against the cosmologies  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=828) which were most respected and of course  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=830) he was aware of  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=831) aristotelian cosmologies and and  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=833) holistic cosmologies  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=834) and he's speaking about exegeting the  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=836) bible in a way  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=838) which is anti-cosmology of  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=841) whatever the most sophisticated  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=842) cosmologies were at that time and so the  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=844) reason why  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=845) he took the impetus if he did would be a  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=848) similar reason  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=849) that origen did in other words because  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=851) of the inconsistencies that he found of  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=853) the biblical discourse  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=854) and the external world and you can see  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=857) this again  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=859) in other places so really and truly here  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=862) i think  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=863) one can conclude it's a catch-22  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=865) situation or you can even call it  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=867) a hermeneutical dilemma if you want to  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=870) take the view of william lane craig that  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=872) the genesis narrative is allegory  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=875) then you must allow for at least the  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=876) possibility that this allegorization her  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=879) musical approach can be  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=880) applied to other more central tenants of  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=883) christianity including the crucifixion  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=884) of resurrection  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=886) this was the approach of at least origin  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=889) of alexandria who  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=891) allegorized large parts of central  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=893) doctrines in order to meet the  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=895) apologetic criterion  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=897) if one wants to say no in fact it's  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=899) literal then one will have to maintain  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=901) not only the contradictions  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=903) the internal ones but they'd have to say  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=905) that the universe is six thousand years  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=906) old  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=907) as per genesis chapter five and the  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=909) account of that and obviously the sixth  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=910) six 24-hour days  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=912) understanding in genesis chapter one  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=916) but in both cases you'd have to maintain  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=918) that there are contradictions in the  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=919) bible  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=920) and the muslim would say this why would  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=922) you believe a book with contradictions  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=925) is as simple as that  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=926) and why would you william lane craig who  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=929) is a premier christian  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=930) apologist and scholar of the christian  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=932) world candidly admit that your book is  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=935) erroneous  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=936) thereby admitting that it's not inerrant  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=939) which is one of the core doctrines of  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=940) the  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=942) evangelicals and christians more  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=944) christians  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=945) than just the evangelicals why would you  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=947) do this and continue believing in this  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=949) book as if  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=950) it is free from error why don't you seek  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=954) the truth  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=955) as your bible says and why would god be  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=957) the author of  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=958) confusion since the bible tells us that  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=960) god shall not be the author of confusion  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=963) how could god punish me for disbelieving  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=965) a book that is  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=966) fraught with contradictions in whatever  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=969) way you decide to interpret it  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=970) allegorical literal or otherwise i say  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=974) this is unfair  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=975) i say this is unjust and i say that  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=978) instead of this  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=979) one should be looking elsewhere for the  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=981) word of god  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/d3uKsG31xWI?t=983) and if you want more information go to
