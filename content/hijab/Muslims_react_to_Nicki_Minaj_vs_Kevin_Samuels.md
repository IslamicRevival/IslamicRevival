[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=54) you brought yourself too high so i had  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=55) to you know what i mean i had to give  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=57) you put me in my place just like kevin  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=59) samuels i think  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=62) it's like he's putting nikki in her  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=64) place now  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=64) to be fair like i made a video as you  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=66) know critical of samuels because you  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=68) know i i just saw as a reaction to  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=70) feminism like this kind of like red pool  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=71) movement and stuff like that and i  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=72) thought  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=73) i actually saw a lot of muslim people  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=75) moving in that direction and i didn't  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=76) like it because i realized the problems  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=78) of it but to be fair yeah on i think we  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=80) just both watched this you know these  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=82) aspects of his um  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=84) video that he done with nicki minaj yeah  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=85) and i think there's praise that is  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=86) actually due here because he he handled  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=88) himself quite well  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=90) despite that i do think there are areas  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=91) of criticism as well so we'll be looking  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=92) at some of that but before that i think  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=95) let's look at two main aspects okay  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=97) let's get straight into it two main  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=99) aspects of this video that i wanted to  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=100) react to yeah  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=102) which uh kind of starts in the middle  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=104) where nikki herself who  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=106) is to be honest with you i don't know  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=108) much about her but from what i know uh  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=110) she's a figure of decadence and if  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=112) someone could personify decadence it  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=114) would be this woman  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=116) um you know  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=118) nothing intellectually contributed at  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=120) all she thinks she's a success we'll  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=122) come to all of that  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=124) starts off by speaking about you know  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=126) success funny enough and these other  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=128) things so i wanted to see what she has  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=130) to say coming onto this platform and  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=132) then how  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=133) we can look also at how kevin responds  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=135) so let's first take a look at what her  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=138) prerogative is here i'm talking to black  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=140) women real quick can we stop talking can  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=142) we stop  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=144) posting all day on to because i i re i  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=147) knew we went to tik tok and i and i just  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=149) kept seeing this black women can we stop  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=151) talking about if black men if these  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=153) successful black men want us or not  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=156) like can we just focus on us and we be  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=160) successful and then we go out there and  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=163) we decide who the [ __ ] we want so what i  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=166) see with this uh z bro is like it's it's  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=168) typical independence narrative  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=171) success narrative she's talking about  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=172) she's a success oh she's  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=174) what is  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=176) what is success i mean is success being  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=178) famous being rich  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=180) i'm sorry to say these are things  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=181) assumptions which cannot be justified  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=184) and who are you anyway nikki to speak to  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=186) black women as if you represent them you  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=188) don't represent them you represent  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=189) higher echelon type individual western  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=192) women  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=193) you don't you don't actually suffer from  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=194) the same plights as the majority of  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=196) black people will suffer from black men  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=198) or women and you don't have even a right  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=200) to call yourself a success because you  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=203) are  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=204) rich and famous success is not defined  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=206) like that for us is it zusha  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=208) no because if you define success as  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=211) richness or fame these are two things  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=214) that don't have an ending like money  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=217) there's always more money that you can  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=219) attain with fame there's always more  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=221) fame that you can attain you'll never be  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=222) able to reach the pinnacle absolutely  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=225) and in our tradition the islamic  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=226) tradition were the prophet muhammad  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=228) sallallahu alaihi said that if you give  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=230) a man  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=231) you know a valley of gold  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=233) you know he'll be hungry for another  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=235) valley so in other words there's always  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=236) the thing is having material wealth as  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=239) you say it doesn't quench your thirst  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=241) for these kinds of things you'll just  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=242) want more and more and more yeah and so  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=245) really there is no pos strong positive  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=247) correlation  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=248) for example  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=249) with happiness as a state  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=252) and  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=253) material wealth you'll find  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=254) unfortunately  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=256) a lot of the richest people in society  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=258) yes and the most famous are those who  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=260) are most depressed yes so this idea of  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=262) equating success with fame and money  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=264) this capitalistic  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=266) idea  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=266) which you have been colonizing to  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=268) believing is the case is itself  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=270) difficult to substantiate from the very  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=272) beginning yes so this is the first thing  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=274) the independence narrative here  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=276) i think is problematic as well but  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=278) before we go there i want to see how  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=280) kevin samuels responds to her  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=283) there's a lot of hurt on both sides and  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=285) i recommend i told guys look why are you  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=287) under 30 work recognize work on getting  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=289) yourself together because like it or not  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=293) you're really not in a position like  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=295) like you should be to be able to work  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=297) with lee do anything like that so as you  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=299) see  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=300) he starts off by saying there's a lot of  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=301) hurt from both sides now this is not  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=303) this is atypical of kevin samuels  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=305) because usually if a woman hypes up like  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=306) that to him and his uh  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=308) in his  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=309) presence  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=310) or discussions he will actually  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=312) shut her down or even switch her off or  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=314) something but i think he's being  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=315) strategic here and he's got good  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=317) emotional intelligence here to be  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=318) praised worthy of him yeah  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=320) however his narrative is as good as hers  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=323) in the sense that he is also telling men  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=325) to i'll just focus on themselves it's an  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=327) egoistic gender narrative on both sides  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=330) and if it's an egoistic gender narrative  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=332) on both sides what you're going to end  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=333) up having is an atomized society with  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=336) people only caring about themselves they  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=339) don't realize  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=340) that complementarity is needed in order  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=342) to avoid conflict of interest in the  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=344) first place like at the end of the day  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=347) if men just think about themselves and  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=349) work on themselves  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=350) not caring about the opposite gender or  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=353) having  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=354) apathetic attitudes and the opposite is  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=356) true imagine what that will do to the  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=357) black community my question is simple  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=360) why are the adults making themselves the  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=363) center of this project indeed seldomly  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=365) do i find in these conversations that  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=367) children are put first like children are  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=370) put first we know through the data  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=372) that  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=374) uh nuclear families and stable families  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=377) are the most  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=378) advantageous for children okay  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=380) but for nuclear families to be  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=382) functional there has to be compromise on  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=384) both sides  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=385) i would call it like the individualistic  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=387) narratives of the west yeah it is  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=389) because at the end of the day like 100  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=391) years ago he mentions this to be fair to  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=392) him kevin samuels mentions this in some  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=394) of his discussions he says your grandma  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=396) wouldn't be speaking like that yeah and  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=397) he's right  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=398) his you know what he's right  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=401) her grandma whoever whoever she's  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=402) speaking to wouldn't be speaking like  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=403) that because she'd have a more  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=404) traditional complementarian nuclear type  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=406) understanding of the family but do you  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=408) know what else is true  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=410) his granddad wouldn't be speaking the  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=411) way he's speaking either  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=413) that's the truth as well like his his  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=415) granddad will be thinking about like how  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=416) do i provide for the kids how do i make  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=418) a family stable how this and that the  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=420) problem the problem is not just with one  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=422) gender or another it's both genders  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=424) realizing individual responsibility and  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=427) recognizing individual weakness and then  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=429) working together to try and sort that  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=431) out and you you mentioned something a  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=433) verse in the quran you wanna explain  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=435) yeah so i think this whole  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=437) complementarianism is something which is  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=438) uh mentioned by the quran to the nearest  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=441) meaning when it says um you are garments  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=444) for them and they are garments for you  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=446) referring to a husband and a wife and  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=448) and  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=449) this issue that you're talking about of  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=451) individualism is something which is you  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=453) know it's a disease that's coming from  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=455) capitalism and it's something which is  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=457) obviously rooted in liberalism um which  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=460) which talks about  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=462) in individual benefit  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=464) and  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=465) of course an offshoot of that is human  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=466) rights which talks about  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=468) um what we're old and not what we owe  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=470) others there's no human right that talks  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=472) about the the rights of your mother or  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=475) the rights of your father and this is a  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=477) problem and liberalism is something  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=479) which is being shoved down our throat  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=481) and we're seeing this in in france this  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=483) is where we're seeing the hijab being  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=484) banned and we're seeing this now in in  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=487) saudi arabia where you've got  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=490) you know  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=491) liberalism being  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=493) injected into the community and and  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=495) other communities so liberalism is an  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=498) issue and that's why liberalism does  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=500) need to come under the microscope  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=501) because it is what is telling us look  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=504) the individual and your pleasure and  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=507) your pain as long as it doesn't affect  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=508) others yeah it's fine it's all i do know  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=511) is it's ethical egoism it's not just  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=513) psychological evil the difference being  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=514) is ethical egoism is like i i am  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=518) sorry psychological egoism is about me  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=520) it's about me yeah it's about my pain  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=522) and pleasure and a lot of us are like  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=523) that by by nature but ethical egoism is  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=525) where you say it ought to be about my  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=527) pleasure first and what we're seeing  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=529) really with this kind of conversation is  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=531) a proliferation of ethical egoistic  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=534) gender discourses yeah so both of them  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=536) are just concerned with each other's  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=537) okay well black women shouldn't do this  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=539) blah blah blah blah blah it's no care  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=541) for the kids same thing with him no care  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=543) for the kids no care for the other  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=545) gender it's a very selfish discourse  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=547) either way but let's move on to  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=549) something else that he mentions  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=550) controversially i guess you know she  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=552) asks him how many times should a man  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=554) expect to have sex let's take a look at  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=556) what she asks and how he responds how  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=558) many times  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=560) should a man  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=563) expect to have  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=565) uh sex what is in your opinion how many  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=567) times should a woman give their man  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=570) sex  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=572) a week  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=573) a week  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=575) uh  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=576) i'm a fan of the as often as he wants it  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=580) well  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=581) no hold on  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=582) because here's the thing it's under  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=584) here's the thing  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=586) you look at like i said i look at guys  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=588) most guys i'm talking to working  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=590) 10 12 hour days so i actually respect  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=593) the way he responds there you know and  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=595) she didn't really have much pushback  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=596) after what he said  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=598) uh which is surprising to be honest but  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=599) i respect the fact that he stuck to his  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=601) kind of guns on this one because at the  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=603) end of the day it's once again sex is  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=605) one of those things okay which is a  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=607) weakness for men more so than it is for  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=608) women it's one of those things and let  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=610) me say  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=611) you know as many of the viewers know  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=613) like muslim women have to wear hijab  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=615) which is more encompassing than what a  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=616) man has to cover and so on and so forth  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=618) yeah  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=619) and a lot of people come muslim and  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=620) non-muslim alike and they say like why  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=622) should a woman cover up for the weakness  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=624) of a man  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=625) that is the wrong why not the question  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=627) is why not why should a man cover up for  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=628) the weakness of a woman if certain  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=630) things certain events a fire happened  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=632) women and children come out first or a  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=634) war happened the men on the front line  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=636) these things are clear that there are  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=637) some things that men are stronger than  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=639) women at and some things that women are  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=641) stronger than men and that's why the  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=643) quran beautifully expresses this in one  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=645) sentence where in senator the human  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=646) being is he's been created weak the  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=648) human being has been created weak and in  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=650) fact in this context it's talking about  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=651) sexual weakness  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=653) and so yeah  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=654) the idea of a man having intercourse  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=657) or the woman helping really facilitating  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=660) for the man  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=661) something which would otherwise be his  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=662) weakness something which would otherwise  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=664) if it's not done it can cause greater  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=666) societal decadence and decay because  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=668) he's going to go try and find find it  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=670) elsewhere  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=672) pathological behavior will start to  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=673) emerge it will destabilize families and  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=675) all kinds of other things happen you  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=677) might start to find her  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=679) you know uh  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=680) he might not he might be put off her to  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=682) be honest with you might be  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=684) a horrible thing for him so yeah this is  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=686) we're not advocating obviously some  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=687) stupid person is going to come out and  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=689) say are you talking about rape or  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=690) something obviously we're not sick if a  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=692) woman doesn't want to give it you can't  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=693) take it from her like that because you  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=694) can't cause anyone harm in islam that's  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=696) what we believe anyway but yeah  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=698) the fact that a woman wouldn't want to  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=699) give it to a man anyways is the mark of  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=702) a dysfunctional relationship yeah it is  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=704) a mark over there but i'm i'm i respect  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=706) the fact that he's he's coming out  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=707) saying this because you won't find many  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=709) people coming out men saying in the way  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=711) that he said that what do you think  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=712) about that yeah i think you made a good  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=714) point unfortunately and sadly in this  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=716) day and age especially in sitcoms when  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=718) you see  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=719) a husband and a wife sex is actually  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=721) used as a weapon  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=722) it's actually used as a weapon kids are  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=725) used as weapons and when you start using  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=727) these things as weapons then what you're  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=729) doing is you are breaking that from that  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=731) family up and if if a man can't get it  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=733) at home if a woman can't get at home  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=736) then i mean the question now arises  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=738) where else are they going to get it from  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=740) well she does mention women here  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=742) should we listen to what she has to say  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=743) yeah we continue let's say you know a  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=745) lot of people throughout my life would  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=747) tell me  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=748) that i'm like a man because i remember i  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=751) never people would tell me  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=753) i shouldn't want to i shouldn't expect  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=756) as a woman to  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=758) have a climax every time i do it right  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=761) i'm like hilton and i said excuse me are  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=764) you out of your [ __ ] mind why  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=766) wouldn't i want to climax every time i  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=769) have intercourse just like you want to  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=771) climax when you have interquest and i  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=773) was i was accused of being like a man  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=778) not in my you know i'm this is years ago  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=781) and i knew that wasn't going to work  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=783) chad cause uh it's not only about you  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=786) okay well i mean yeah i think you were  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=788) mentioning it before as well that this  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=789) is something that  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=790) in islam when you look at the literature  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=792) this is something that's emphasized that  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=794) it's not just about the man's pleasure  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=796) it is about the females pleasure as well  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=798) i mean just like  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=800) when we're talking about  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=801) complementarianism  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=802) and we're talking about both parties  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=804) then this actually fits in very well to  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=806) that i agree  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=808) a lot of men and the prophet gave  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=809) explicit advice as like not to come in  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=811) and go out straight away  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=813) even to to warm up a woman to foreplay  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=815) all that kind of stuff  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=816) very  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=817) specific about this shows you this  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=819) comprehensiveness of the guidance of  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=820) islam like  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=821) women work in a different sexual manner  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=824) to men and i'll tell you something like  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=826) honestly a lot of men we talk about men  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=828) withholding and sexual  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=829) marriages and stuff but also women men  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=831) sorry women withholding but men will  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=833) hold as well sometimes like and and that  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=835) is  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=836) if you want to destroy your marriage as  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=838) a man  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=839) then the first thing you'll do is ignore  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=840) your woman's sexual needs  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=842) not necessarily yeah  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=844) you know unnecessarily of course but  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=846) either way is unnecessary like in the  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=847) sense that why are you no because in the  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=849) quran it does say that you can oh yeah  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=852) if she's unnecessarily in the sense that  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=853) you know it's not because she's acting  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=856) rebelliously or something like that or  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=857) and no shoes  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=858) of course of course good point but like  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=860) what i'm saying is exactly you know what  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=862) i'm trying to say like  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=863) if she wants  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=865) something and you're ignoring that  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=867) men need to also realize that this is a  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=869) quick way to break a family  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=871) and then she would you not think that  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=872) this you're going to cause a fitnah do  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=873) you not think does not a man not think  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=875) that by leaving his wife sexual needs  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=877) and she wants to do something and she's  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=879) prodding him and she wants to you know  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=881) engage sexual sexually women he's like  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=883) kind of like giving her the cold  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=884) shoulder or on his phone or something  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=886) like that does he not think that he's  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=888) now destroying the family and that he's  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=890) making a fitna for himself and for his  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=892) uh for his family yeah so it's at the  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=894) same time like we have to be fair here  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=896) just islam it gives actually if a man  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=899) can't sexually satisfy a woman there's  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=901) and and it continues and he's is  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=903) stopping herself there's very strong  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=905) grounds for a divorce here there's  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=907) actually i'm not saying that woman  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=908) should do that she should obviously try  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=909) and wash  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=916) it shows how serious of an issue that it  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=918) is yeah there's yeah this is you can't  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=919) you cannot yeah you cannot withhold from  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=923) either party and this goes back to the  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=924) complementarian point yeah but so yeah  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=926) we agree with that we agree with that  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=929) but generally now before we close off  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=930) what do you think of this conversation  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=932) back and forth we've already talked  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=934) about what's conspicuously kind of  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=935) missing here which is mention of the  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=936) children and these conversations they  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=938) always disregard the children  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=940) in family settings what else would you  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=942) say is missing or should have been added  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=944) or could have been i think what's  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=945) interesting here is  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=947) someone like myself or when i was  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=948) initially watching it i expected cam  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=951) kevin samuels to go in full guns blazing  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=953) and just smash her to bits and stuff  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=955) like that because that's that's what  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=956) he's known for yeah and oh i was  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=958) expecting nikki to be very blase and  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=960) very kind of loud and you know very i'm  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=964) gonna represent for the people and all  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=965) these women and i'm gonna lay on him i  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=968) think both of them were clever in their  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=969) approach um kevin respected her um and  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=973) she respected him and i think we were  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=976) discussing before as well that i think  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=978) he maneuvered himself very well uh in  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=980) that discussion so in that sort of sense  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=983) on that point actually you make a good  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=984) point because at the end of it is like  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=986) this is this actually it might seem  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=988) uh  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=989) like  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=990) trivial yeah i guess  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=992) but at the end he was like i need to go  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=994) now and i know that might seem like  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=996) something trivial but i think it was  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=997) premeditated personally you know and i  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=999) think that actually speaks volumes to  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1001) the kind of thing as muslim men yeah  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1003) because it's not just we're not here to  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1004) criticize only kevin and nikki well  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1006) nikki we should be criticizing to be  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1007) honest she's  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1008) from the looks of it a completely  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1009) decadent character but with kevin at  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1011) least  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1012) there are some things which muslim men  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1014) can actually learn from and this is one  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1016) of them if you look at the end of this  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1017) conversation he's like have you got any  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1019) more questions because i need to leave  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1021) well good to be on here with you you got  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1023) any other questions because i gotta get  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1026) but the phraseology is actually very  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1027) telling here have you got any questions  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1029) so he's the he's the one that's being  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1030) questioned yeah he's put himself in the  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1032) teachers the edifying position he's the  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1034) teacher  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1035) because i need to you know go whatever  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1036) yeah meaning  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1038) i've got things to do i i don't value  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1040) you as much as you think you value  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1042) yourself  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1043) he's not saying that in explicit terms  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1045) but he's gesturing it through implicit  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1048) action because he knows if he does it  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1050) explicitly he's risking putting his  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1052) reputation at risk with someone of her  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1054) social profile you know who is at least  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1056) seen the society as successful although  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1058) she is not according to us yeah  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1060) what do you think of that kind of  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1061) maneuvering bro so there's websites  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1063) nowadays in which people go and you know  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1066) they unlock pictures and they they spend  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1069) extortion amounts of money just so they  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1071) can interact with women and there's a uh  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1073) a term which has been coined called  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1075) simping  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1076) where even in in games people pay  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1079) extortionate amounts to female gamers  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1081) just so they can kind of sit there and  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1083) simp over them and stuff like that so  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1085) this has become a big problem in our  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1087) society and for for us to kind of  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1090) they're an asian community as much like  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1092) it's in every community unfortunately  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1094) sadly there's a pakistani before you  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1096) tell us what's happening  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1098) it's it's in every community that i've  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1100) seen yeah because the world has become a  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1102) global village it's not i think we're  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1103) okay  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1105) you know the highest consumers of uh  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1108) pornography and stuff like that is  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1110) actually the  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1112) it's actually not that different though  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1114) we're talking about this this groveling  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1115) attitude we call simping in it yeah yeah  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1117) that's the he he exemplifies a good  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1120) example even  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1121) even when you look at the economic  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1122) hitman by john perkins he actually talks  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1124) about you know people that higher up in  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1126) certain arab countries oh you're trying  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1128) to first of all  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1129) you hear this  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1134) where this bro they pay extortionate  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1136) amounts just to to get white women and  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1138) stuff like that this is this is uh  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1140) post-colonial simping that that's what  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1142) it is  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1143) so in that sense to see somebody like  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1146) this because nikki at the start she  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1148) actually rated herself as a seven  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1150) now she's absolutely she doesn't think  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1152) but she did which was interesting but  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1154) then you can ask a question yeah  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1156) sorry i don't you know i don't know  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1159) i've not heard a single song from this  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1161) woman i don't know who this woman is you  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1163) know right i had to research her after i  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1165) saw this thing with this guy yeah okay  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1166) i'm not just saying that i know she's  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1167) famous but she thinks she's famous and  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1169) important i don't think she is all right  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1172) but  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1172) is he who rated him nine out of ten  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1174) right he did yeah  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1176) i mean is that something you would say  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1177) is accurate  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1181) i mean is that is that do you think he's  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1183) doing that to kind of boost her ego or  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1184) something about that i think he is  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1186) because it was very interesting because  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1188) i think you made the point you said at  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1190) the start when he increased her rating  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1192) the conversation took a different turn  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1194) imagine if he gave like a four uh which  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1197) i think would actually  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1198) i checked let me say something  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1200) sorry to say well i checked the  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1202) wikipedia page of this individual yeah  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1204) and i saw that she was like 40. like on  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1206) his standards i don't see how his  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1207) subjective measuring stick is is all  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1209) over because on his a four-year-old  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1211) woman for him well he and he says over  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1214) 35 is gone so how could he be giving her  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1216) that number i think maybe it was a  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1218) strategic move because i think with any  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1220) of these celebrities so that means his  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1221) his rating system is is flawed bro or  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1224) maybe this was like exceptionalism maybe  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1227) it was one-off that he was just trying  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1228) to protect himself yeah protect himself  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1231) and stuff like because imagine if he  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1232) upset nikki and then he's getting a  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1233) barrage of thousands of messages after  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1236) the ejaculation after the orgasm yeah  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1240) after both parties or one of them

[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1283) way  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1284) the communities are going to break down  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1285) as i said it's just egoism on steroids  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1288) yeah i think that's a that's a very good  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1289) point a very good summary and uh  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1292) i think  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1293) it proves and it shows that islam has  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1295) the holistic kind of view you can go to  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/l33Wv9GSHuc?t=1297) isms and schisms and some things that
