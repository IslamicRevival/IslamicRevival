[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=6) podcasts in history

[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=12) books  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=13) she specializes in many issues to do  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=15) with uh

[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=36) done it for 10 years and now she

[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=45) able to see on her socials so let's  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=46) start off sister naima  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=49) what kind of issues  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=51) have you been kind of trying to help  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=53) sisters with  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=55) in the muslim community what have you  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=56) found to be the salient issues  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=58) problematic issues for women in the in  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=60) the muslim community such that  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=62) especially male members need to pay  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=64) attention to  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=67) oh okay i think i had an answer for the  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=69) first part of the question and the  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=70) second part made me think and made me  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=72) pause  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=73) i think what we see within our space  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=77) in terms of what sisters struggle with  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=79) is a lot of mental barriers  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=83) i would say that many many sisters  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=86) suffer from  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=88) a sort of victim hood  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=90) or some kind of  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=92) imprisonment of the mind more than a lot  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=94) of other things why i say that is  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=96) because lots of us don't realize really  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=99) how powerful our own mindset is in  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=103) determining how we feel about our lives  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=105) how we feel about our marriages about  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=107) our children about our prospects a lot  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=110) of that is actually what's happening in  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=112) your mind right not necessarily what's  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=113) happening on the ground so the work that  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=115) i do is geared towards helping sisters  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=119) and general in people in general  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=121) understand the power of their own  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=122) mindset and taking back control of that  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=126) which they can control  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=128) uh and you know we call it women's  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=130) empowerment and we've had this  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=132) conversation before where you know  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=133) people are wondering well what kind of  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=135) empowerment are you actually talking  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=137) about  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=138) for me the most potent form of power is  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=141) self-control  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=142) is self-awareness is you know being able  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=145) to navigate your own mind and be able to  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=147) regulate yourself and that's a skill  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=149) that we don't teach children we don't  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=151) teach it to young people we don't teach  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=153) it to men or women um so that's really  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=155) the work that i do subhanallah what is  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=157) the um what are some of those barriers  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=159) that you speak about you say you  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=160) mentioned some mental barriers that  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=161) women  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=162) in the community have  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=164) from your experience  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=166) what are some of those barriers  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=169) i would say  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=170) when i've spoken with sisters and when  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=172) i've worked with sisters the  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=174) predominantly women come to me because  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=176) they feel that something's missing okay  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=178) um they  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=180) lack confidence in themselves  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=183) there is a sense of you know failure  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=185) about their lives wherever they are  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=187) whether they're single married whether  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=189) they have children or the children have  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=190) left the nest there's this sense that  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=192) they are not good enough that they're  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=194) not worthy but they're failing somehow  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=196) um and you know that's a really powerful  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=200) lens  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=201) to to look at your life with the lens of  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=203) failure because if you're looking at  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=205) your life through the lens of failure  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=206) guess what you're going to find failure  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=208) everywhere right if you're looking at  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=210) your life through the lens of you know  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=213) i'm not good enough or i'm not good as  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=215) good as so and so that's what you're  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=217) going to see replicated time and time  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=219) again and this is for men and women you  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=221) know way that we see ourselves impacts  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=223) directly our experience of of life of  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=227) everything that's happening around us so  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=229) you know for  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=230) for me  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=231) empowering sisters is helping them to  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=234) show up you know like i talk about to  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=236) show up fully for the lives that allah  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=239) has chosen for them  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=241) and every single one of us allah has  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=244) picked a path for us  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=246) and that's the path that matters  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=248) not your sister's path or your cousins  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=251) or your sister-in-law or anyone else but  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=253) the path that allah has put you on your  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=256) responsibilities the people who count on  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=259) you your opportunities your challenges

[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=263) on living your life intentionally and  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=266) showing up to every one of those  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=267) challenges the more satisfying your life  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=270) will be to be honest and the more  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=271) fulfilled you'll be in the life you have  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=274) right now and that for me is is golden  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=276) because it makes everything easier  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=279) what are some of the women's specific  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=280) issues because a lot of what you said  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=282) there could like you've kind of alluded  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=283) to yeah equally applied to males and  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=285) females so what are some of the women's  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=287) specific issues which through our own  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=289) paradigm like obviously  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=291) uh this whole conversation we're going  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=293) to assume the islamic paradigm here but  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=295) let's let's for the sake of argument say  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=297) through our own paradigm  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=300) that women have concerns with that  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=302) legitimate concerns  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=303) which we all need to be aware of we all  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=306) need to to to to to aid in helping them  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=309) with  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=310) and that we need to have empathy on  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=315) i would say the topic that comes up the  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=318) most uh in general is and not  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=321) surprisingly is relationships um  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=325) and specifically marriage and then  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=326) everything that kind of radiates  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=328) outwards from a marriage um whether it's  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=331) in laws whether it's children whether  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=332) it's step children whether it's looking  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=334) to get married whether it's healing from  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=336) a divorce a lot of the problems that  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=338) we're seeing in the community do  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=341) kind of revolve around that relationship  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=343) between a man and a woman  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=346) and certainly over the years that's the  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=348) area in which i've seen the most  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=351) dysfunction in our community  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=353) that's where i've seen the most damage  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=355) being caused  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=356) the most pain being inflicted kind of  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=358) both ways and of course the fallout is  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=360) our children  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=362) and what they see growing up and what  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=364) they either want to replicate or don't  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=366) want to replicate so i would say  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=369) if we could  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=371) get our marriages on point  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=374) so many things would change so many  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=376) issues that we're having with the  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=378) children with the youth with mental  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=380) health with even poverty and things like  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=382) that so many of those issues would cease  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=386) to be an issue if those fundamental  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=388) relationships were healed and were  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=389) healthy um because two healthy people  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=393) you know bringing up a family that's the  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=395) unit that we're you know that that's the  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=396) unit that we are striving to create but  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=399) when there is unrest when there is  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=401) dysfunction when there is pain in that  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=404) central relationship it again radiates  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=406) outward to everything so like i said all  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=408) of the issues surrounding a marriage  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=411) on the beginning of it the end of it and  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=413) in the but in the in between those those  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=415) are all the issues that i see still are  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=418) issues for our sisters a good 20 years  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=420) later so i've been muslim for 20 years  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=423) uh over 20 years now masha'allah and  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=426) it's still the same stuff and sometimes  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=428) upon allah i'm actually surprised  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=429) because i remember when i was deep in  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=431) the community i was living in a certain  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=433) community and it was rough it was rough  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=436) the  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=437) the the the situations that sisters were  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=440) in the the kind of conditions under  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=442) which they were kind of operating  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=445) it was it was tough it was tough to  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=447) witness it was tough to try to support  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=449) someone through that process knowing  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=450) that there was actually very little you  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=452) could do and it's it's just it's kind of  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=454) dismaying to me to see that we still  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=456) haven't figured it out we're still  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=458) having some of those same issues and  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=460) sometimes even more now because new  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=461) issues have come up to basically attack  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=464) that unit of the family  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=466) what are some of those issues in  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=467) particular  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=469) that  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=470) you could say  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=471) constitute patterns continuities  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=474) um  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=476) like let me let me give you one example  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=477) let's give one example right and let's  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=480) let's put it out there  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=482) the idea of an absent father  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=484) okay and i believe an absolute father  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=486) now  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=486) you  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=487) as you say you kind of counsel women you  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=490) speak to them you  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=492) yourself with a single motherboard for  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=494) completely different reasons which uh  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=496) you  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=497) intimate in your book uh  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=499) which i'm gonna get uh  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=502) show up show up here show up show up  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=505) which we recommend that you get it's a  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=507) very powerful  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=508) uh but just looking at the first kind of  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=510) 20 30 pages is you know  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=512) so emotional it's well written and  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=515) it's amazing how you articulate yourself  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=517) but putting that aside  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=520) how  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=522) how can we  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=523) how can we frame the idea  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=526) of  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=526) the problems that are caused by an  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=528) absent father  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=529) in the community what have you seen  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=531) with your with your clients with your  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=533) colleagues with your friends  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=535) what kind of damage does that cause  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=539) i would say that you know the  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=541) for me the most shocking thing that i've  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=543) observed over the years is  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=547) the seeming and again this is anecdotal  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=549) because i'm not a a social scientist i  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=552) haven't got the data but i know you've  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=555) got any dots are important to us neymar  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=557) your anecdotes are important well that's  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=558) what you're going to get that's what  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=559) you're going to  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=560) get honestly your experiences are very  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=562) important especially as we know there is  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=564) a death or a non-existence in some cases  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=566) of some of this kind of data especially  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=568) within the muslim community  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=570) so your your experience are very  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=571) important  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=574) i think for me i've been very vocal  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=576) about this on social media um you know  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=578) my videos all over instagram or whatever  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=579) but for me the most shocking thing that  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=582) i've seen in this area is  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=585) when there is a divorce  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=586) and the father is basically he's gone  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=590) he's left uh he's left the marriage he's  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=592) left the wife and he's left the kids  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=595) and i don't understand the thinking  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=599) behind that um because i know so many  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=602) sisters who when there's a divorce they  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=604) are literally on their own so they are  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=607) not only responsible for the children on  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=609) a day-to-day basis but they are  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=611) responsible for them economically  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=613) socially in terms of school in terms of  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=615) everything the father is he's out he's  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=618) out and i i've said this before um  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=623) we really  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=624) really need to start thinking so much  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=627) more carefully and being so much more  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=629) intentional when we start families  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=631) because as i have said before  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=634) the children pay the price  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=637) and that trauma that we are that we are  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=639) living through our broken homes our  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=641) children are carrying that trauma and  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=643) they will carry it into their families  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=645) as well so i i can think of a particular  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=647) situation where you know the father was  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=650) around he was working was a breadwinner  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=652) um and the divorce was was not amicable  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=655) at all it was a very very difficult  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=656) divorce but it was one of those where it  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=658) was like this cannot continue  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=661) when he left the home he stopped  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=663) speaking to the children completely cut  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=665) off from them completely they would ring  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=667) him he wouldn't pick up they would leave  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=669) voice messages  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=670) to be honest this kind of thing sorry to  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=672) chime in here but  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=674) this kind of thing really does make me  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=675) sick because it's  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=677) i think if anything it exposed the true  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=679) character of that person  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=681) like their true colors came out when  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=683) that that particular man his true colors  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=685) came out when the divorce took place  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=687) because if you're willing to sacrifice  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=688) your children for something that's  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=690) completely no fault of their own  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=692) that must mean at least  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=694) that your love for yourself  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=697) is far exceeds anything else in life  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=700) it's like the  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=702) ultimate manifestation of narcissism  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=704) like i'm going to teach everyone a  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=706) lesson i don't care what collateral  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=707) damage it is  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=708) just so that you know they know who i am  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=711) and what i'm about  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=713) i think that there is that  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=716) yeah i think these men should be exposed  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=717) honestly like if in these in the  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=719) community if a man is genuinely doing  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=721) that  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=722) to to putting the kids you know in  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=725) harm's way in that manner i think that  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=727) the community though  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=729) i don't know if this is a strong stance  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=730) in your perspective may get your  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=731) perspective on it but the community the  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=734) imams the  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=735) his friends should uh do anything that  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=738) by any means necessary to influence his  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=740) behavior because  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=741) that is for me uh despicable and  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=743) deplorable action and he should be  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=745) boycotted he should be uh  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=748) the heart the hard approach should be  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=749) used on him the kind approach but this  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=751) kind of person shouldn't be just allowed  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=753) to live in society normal he just left  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=755) his kids and said i don't know am i  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=756) having am i having an emotional reaction  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=758) to this or do you think i'm justified  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=760) no no i i think i think you're justified  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=762) i think we it we i i have observed this  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=765) over the years and you know anybody who  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=767) sees it differently is free to disagree  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=769) but what i've seen in the communities  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=770) that i've known is that brothers give  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=773) each other a pass  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=775) you know whatever you do in your private  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=776) life ahi nothing to do with me like  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=778) that's your family do you know what i  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=780) mean like i'm not gonna step into your  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=781) territory i'm not a family that is left  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=783) behind this kind of way yeah whatever's  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=785) happening whatever the case it could be  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=788) that there's injustice happening at home  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=790) that sister is like you know it's known  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=792) in the community that sister is  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=793) desperately unhappy or that he's taken  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=795) away her rights in some shape or form or  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=797) whatever but he's still a brother and  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=799) he's still welcome and he still gets  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=801) salaam and he still has you know his  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=803) place in the society because i don't  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=805) know whether it's like a a is a thing or  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=807) a thing but for us as sisters i'll be  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=809) honest and this is something that  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=810) sisters have been saying for years and  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=812) years it's like no one ever tells the  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=816) brothers anything  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=818) anytime that there's advice or footballs  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=820) or warnings it's always to the sisters  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=823) sisters fear allah sisters hijab sisters  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=826) do this sisters do that obey your  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=828) husbands sisters give him what he wants  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=830) sister sister sisters and unfortunately  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=833) we're human beings sisters are doing  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=834) wrong and brothers are doing wrong but  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=836) what we don't often hear or see from the  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=839) the elders in the community is brothers  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=841) actually being pulled up and said you  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=843) can't do this you know whether it's on a  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=845) sort of grassroots level  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=847) person to person or even from the member  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=850) to say brothers  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=852) you know this is not acceptable in our  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=853) deen and actually teaching our brothers  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=856) that  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=857) i'll just i just want to make this point  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=860) yes in our communities many many times  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=863) you'll find that we enable bad behavior  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=866) especially amongst men and boys we  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=869) enable it how do we enable it by making  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=871) excuses for it by not pulling them up on  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=874) it domestic violence is a great example  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=876) okay when there's actual violence in the  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=878) home yeah there's actually violence or  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=880) there's alcohol abuse or there's drugs  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=882) or anything like that the family's  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=885) response is typically to cover and to  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=887) shield right we don't want to get the  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=889) police involved we don't want the  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=891) neighbors involved we don't want the  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=892) community involved and if the woman has  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=894) the audacity to speak up she's the one  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=897) who's shamed she's the one who's blamed  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=900) how could you embarrass us like this you  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=902) know it's your fault he did x y and z  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=904) it's very easy to blame and shame the  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=906) woman rather than actually addressing  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=909) this issue with your son and saying in  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=911) our family this is not acceptable so we  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=913) become a community of enablers and okay  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=916) but before we move on with this  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=918) usually yeah sorry sorry i'm sorry to  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=920) show you that and before we move on  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=922) the issue here is when we use terms like  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=925) domestic violence  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=926) you know um  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=927) i told you i think before we started the  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=929) show that i wrote a small little  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=931) pamphlet book  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=932) uh which was really the um combination  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=934) combined effort of my postgraduate  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=936) essays that i've done  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=938) on gender studies um anyway one of them  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=940) was about domestic violence and what i  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=942) found was problematic there was a  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=944) particular woman  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=945) who wrote a definition for what domestic  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=947) violence is  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=948) her name was kumasi i think has  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=950) correctly pronouncing her name and she  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=953) says something to the effect of and i'm  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=954) paraphrasing but this is it's in my book  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=956) if someone wants to see  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=958) um that domestic violence is um  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=960) is defined as is defined as  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=963) when one spouse  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=965) um  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=966) you know  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=967) abuse of one spouse to another or  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=969) violence violence of one's past another  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=971) uh usually and this is exactly what she  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=973) said in her definition usually from a  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=975) man to a woman yeah  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=976) now  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=978) any any any social scientist will tell  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=979) you this is a problem because it it begs  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=982) the question in the sense it's kind of  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=983) assumed the answer of the question  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=985) before it started it so you couldn't put  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=987) the results  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=988) like the hypothesis and the conclusion  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=990) should be two different things  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=992) the issue with  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=993) the terms like domestic violence and  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=996) rape and and these kinds of terms  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=998) is what whose definition are we really  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1000) using are we using the definition  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1003) of kumasi who's already put her  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1006) conclusion in her hypothesis are we  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1009) using the definition of uh mckinnon who  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1012) defines rape as sexual intercourse any  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1014) sexual intercourse even with uh  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1016) catherine mckinnon says that it's rape  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1018) it's even with consent  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1020) so  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1021) the issue with using these terms and  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1022) especially sometimes the legal  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1023) definitions are so vague what are the  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1026) definitions of abuse  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1027) like for example  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1029) um the you can have monetary abuse  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1032) what does monetary abuse look like well  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1034) you're not giving a pocket money enough  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1035) pocket money what kind of pocket money  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1036) do you need  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1038) what would you do it's not really like  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1040) that it's more you know if a person is  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1042) has money in there  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1044) away from that money got you but naimo  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1046) my issue is when we have these such wide  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1048) definitions of these things right yeah  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1051) as so you say well she's been raped  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1053) and what he means by mckinnon's  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1055) definition being raped means  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1058) someone had sex with her but on someone  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1060) on the governmental definition is the  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1061) insurgent of the penis or whatever it  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1063) may be by the way rape on the uk law can  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1065) only be done by a man to a woman it is  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1067) discriminatory by really yeah there's no  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1070) such thing as weight  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1071) a woman she can sexually assault a man  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1073) but she cannot rape a man uk law for  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1075) example but anyway putting that aside  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1077) even though you can imagine her sorry  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1079) sorry to be explicit but she can put  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1080) some knife in here or she can put a  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1082) bottle in him she can do something she  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1083) can she can sedate him  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1085) all these things are possible you know  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1087) it's only defined in in that way but  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1089) putting that all to the side the point  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1090) is  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1091) whoever gets to set the definition  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1094) gets to control the narrative whoever  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1095) gets to control the narrative  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1097) gets to call the shots and my issue with  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1100) a lot of these key terms is that if we  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1102) don't have it in the islamic narrative  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1104) and we use these terms like abuse  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1105) domestic violence and what's it what  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1107) what all these things  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1109) then  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1110) uh it can easily come in someone can  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1112) come in with another agenda  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1114) and take our community to a completely  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1116) different direction would you agree to  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1117) that or to what extent would you agree  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1119) to that  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1120) um well of course it's plausible but do  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1122) you think that's what's happened with  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1124) the community  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1125) do you think that we've been kind of  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1127) kind of coerced yeah i think there are  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1129) examples of one i'll give you one  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1130) example where i think maybe we'll both  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1132) agree right  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1133) one example where we definitely both  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1135) agree is that in the islamic law right  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1138) we believe that kin's ties of kinship  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1140) should not should be respected  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1142) yeah we talked about the case of the  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1144) absent father right okay but there's  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1146) also the courageous voluntarily absent  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1148) father yeah  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1151) yeah but what about the case also of the  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1153) the woman who's weaponizing the children  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1156) and leveraging them  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1157) in after a divorce in order to spite the  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1159) father and that happens a lot so much so  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1162) that is i mean organizations like  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1164) fathers for justice and these kind of  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1166) they have come up and let me give you a  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1168) real scenario which i think you're aware  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1169) of right  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1171) say for example a man or woman gets  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1172) separated for whatever reason it may be  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1174) yeah  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1175) man and women get separated the woman  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1177) has custody of the children she's the  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1179) primary  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1180) custodian of the children she takes care  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1182) of them and so on  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1184) now he wants to have access to his child  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1186) so there's they have to arbitrate they  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1188) have to go to court family court in the  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1190) uk and so on yeah in the meantime he  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1192) can't see his children  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1194) in the meantime she has  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1196) she she is barring him preventing him  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1199) stopping him from seeing the children  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1201) and for every second that she's stopping  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1203) him from seeing the children from  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1204) islamic perspective she's sinning not  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1206) even every second every millisecond and  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1209) she's not just  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1211) sinning for that  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1213) she's sitting for stopping the extended  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1214) family for example the man's  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1217) the grandparents of the children or the  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1218) aunties the uncles from seeing those  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1220) children again as well  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1223) and you you were talking about and it's  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1224) true and i do agree that there is this  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1225) kind of culture of  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1227) gender bias it might not be feminism or  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1229) red pill or whatever it may be but it  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1230) could be geneva like where genuinely  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1233) people think that you know  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1235) he's he's one of one of the guys and  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1237) whatever so i'm not going to say  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1238) anything but i think on the other hand  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1239) as well you do have gender bias from the  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1241) from the sisters as well like sometimes  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1243) she'll see  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1244) that her friend is preventing  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1247) her ex-husband from seeing the kids her  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1249) friend will make bogus excuses  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1252) yeah and he's not doing it my way he's  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1253) not giving me enough money whatever it  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1255) is and she will acquiesce to that as  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1257) well would you agree is that happening  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1259) yeah i think i i would say i agree i  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1261) think there's a general kind of uh  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1263) opinion that women back each other up  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1266) and it's even got a name it's called  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1268) girl code right out there in the world  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1270) um where women validate each other women  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1272) back each other up no matter what right  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1275) i would say within the muslim community  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1277) the sisters who don't do that are the  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1279) ones who are firmly rooted in deen  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1282) because when you love someone for the  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1283) sake of allah true it's not about girl  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1285) code it's not about yeah you're my girl  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1288) and yeah whatever it's sis this is haram  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1291) exactly you know and i have witnessed  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1292) those conversations before and someone  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1294) has said you know i have been involved  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1296) in those conversations say sis have you  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1298) checked to see whether that is okay you  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1300) know have you asked anybody about that  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1302) and with something like this yeah sorry  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1304) to cut you off sorry i'm i'm cutting up  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1306) a bit too much but  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1308) with something like this you don't need  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1309) to check like the prophet muhammad said  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1313) you know that someone who cuts the kins  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1315) of  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1316) kinship is not going to go to heaven  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1318) so yeah  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1319) this is such a like it's a clear thing  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1321) it's  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1323) actually if you  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1325) open the quran the second or third page  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1326) i don't know  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1329) um  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1332) the ones who cut  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1334) the the ties that allah wanted to be  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1337) maintained and then they create  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1339) corruption in the land  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1340) any tafsir will tell you that's not just  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1343) you know your parents and your  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1344) grandparents and dashie or the extended  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1346) family but it's even your friends and  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1348) your neighbors and these kind of things  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1349) as well so i mean imagine someone  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1351) stopping their children from seeing a  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1352) parent  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1353) that's stopping the child from that is  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1355) stopping the child from performing an  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1357) obligatory act that is stopping the  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1359) parent from performing obligatory act  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1361) that is um  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1363) that is causing emotional damage to  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1365) someone unjustly that is all of those  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1368) things are more  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1369) what do you think about that  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1371) you know as you're saying all of this  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1372) i'm just thinking of i'm thinking of it  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1375) from sort of two angles and i think my  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1377) my conclusion is that as as human beings  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1380) we just need to sort it out because just  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1382) as okay so there's one thing  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1384) this happening to men  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1386) because men especially muslim men up  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1389) until very recently have not really had  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1392) spaces where they have talked about  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1393) their lived experience  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1395) it's always assumed that the brother is  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1397) the brothers are okay the brothers are  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1400) cool because they have all the power  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1402) they have all the control they get to do  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1404) whatever they want and basically they're  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1406) never the victims women are the victims  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1408) sisters are always the victims right so  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1410) and i think that is a narrative in our  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1412) community that is a narrative  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1414) and i think it's because sisters will  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1416) talk about their problems sisters have  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1418) been much more vocal of late about the  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1420) issues that they go through etc so we  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1422) know what each other are going through  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1423) but brothers may not speak to each other  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1426) but they certainly have not up until  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1427) lately really been speaking honestly  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1430) about hey you know what  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1431) i'm struggling with this or this has  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1433) happened to me and i'm suffering because  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1435) of this so even in our minds the idea of  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1438) a muslim man suffering because of a  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1440) woman it's like what are you talking  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1441) about  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1442) that never  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1450) especially when you hear the woman like  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1453) you know if a person a judge or an  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1455) arbitrator or a third party  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1458) another stakeholder of some sort and  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1460) they literally just see and hear the  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1461) woman  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1462) like you just hear and see the woman  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1464) crying it's enough she has won already  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1466) like  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1467) or at least she has convinced you know  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1469) but if you see a big man you know a huge  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1472) man with dominance and especially if  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1474) he's an extrovert yes it's almost like  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1476) there's no chance he's got no chance are  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1478) you telling me that she's oppressing him  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1480) you know  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1482) this is something  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1484) this is something that i want to just  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1485) touch on and i hope it's not you know  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1487) too  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1487) too um open for this audience but i'll  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1490) give you another example i think it's  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1491) too open for my audience  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1493) okay  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1494) well  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1495) you know as i have two sons and i have i  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1497) have three sons and i have two daughters  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1499) alhamdulillah and so  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1501) when i'm looking at gender in general i  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1505) feel i have a responsibility to be as  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1507) balanced as possible and to be as fair  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1510) as possible and to be as just as  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1512) possible so just as you're talking about  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1515) men who are having their children  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1516) weaponized um i can't  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1519) i cannot say that's not happening you  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1521) know how we always say believe women  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1524) and also we've had many situations where  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1526) women have come forward and said this is  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1528) happening to us and the brothers have  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1529) been like no or the imam or the whoever  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1531) is like i know sister you must have done  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1533) this you must have done that  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1534) similarly i must extend the same grace  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1537) to brothers so if brothers come forward  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1539) and they say look i haven't seen my kids  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1542) for two years and i've been trying but  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1543) xyz we have to give them the benefit of  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1546) the doubt we have to think that it's  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1548) possible that that is true just like if  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1550) a sister came to me i would you know i  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1551) would give her the benefit of a doubt  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1552) and say you know what says i hear you  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1554) anyway no but the burden of proof like  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1556) can i just say something here yeah the  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1558) but we're not we're not the brother's  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1559) not coming forward and saying though the  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1561) woman has raped me or she has the stuff  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1563) the kind of things that you know require  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1565) a heavy burden of proof in islam is  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1567) she's not coming and saying that  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1569) that is the the burden of to establish a  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1572) woman is stopping a man from seeing his  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1573) children is fairly you can say fairly  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1575) simple all they have to do is test it  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1577) out come see them on a saturday are you  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1580) going to be there or not if if if not  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1582) why not why are you not going to bring  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1583) the kid he wants to see them on saturday  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1584) uh they want to see him on saturday you  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1586) know this is the time that is willing to  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1588) take them uh is that allow are you  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1590) allowing this or are you not allowing  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1591) this  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1591) all you have to do is basically if you  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1593) ask this question you will be able to  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1595) establish whether the person is  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1596) borrowing personally  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1598) so you don't need four witnesses for  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1599) this it's just an easy burden of proof  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1601) and so what i'm saying is  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1603) it's definitely happening i mean i'm  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1604) sorry i've um might have said the story  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1606) before but me and alidawah we went to uh  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1609) and he'll remember this he went to  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1610) sacramento in california and there was a  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1612) story that stuck with me  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1614) you know this man who's they were  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1616) telling me went to the masjid you know  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1618) he went to the masjid and  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1619) uh every day and fajr i think he they  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1622) were saying he was and then he had a bad  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1623) divorce  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1624) and they were telling me that uh you  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1627) know he had his last day with his  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1629) daughters he had two daughters and his  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1631) last day with them and he couldn't bear  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1633) that you know the other woman now she's  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1634) married another man and that the courts  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1637) have all been fooled in her favor so he  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1639) he done a monstrous act you know he went  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1642) to the lake and he killed both of those  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1644) daughters and he killed himself you know  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1646) and this is from the  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1647) un  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1648) involuntary i'm not even he was  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1650) responsible for this but this this  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1652) disgusting behavior or this this kind of  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1655) reaction took place because of an  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1657) initial injustice now two wrongs  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1658) obviously and cannot make you can never  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1661) ever justify something but the truth is  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1663) we can avoid these kind of things  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1664) another situation i heard just a person  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1666) who's been prevented from seeing the  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1668) children literally died from it  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1671) literally had panic attack seizures  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1673) until they died from it  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1675) why did that happen or because he had a  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1677) secret second wife or something happened  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1679) you went to this country and even and  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1681) then the woman found out and she said  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1682) you're never going to see your children  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1683) again and a few years down the line he  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1685) just he couldn't he his health couldn't  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1687) handle it and he deteriorated and died  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1689) because of a stroke or some some heart  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1691) attack or something which is related to  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1693) it now all i'm saying is these kind of  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1696) things if you're really honest about it  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1698) could be prevented but they we need to  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1700) have i don't know what tell me if i'm  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1701) wrong because once again i'm not a  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1704) pastoral  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1705) my specialism is not  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1707) pastoral counseling or something like  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1708) this it's more this is why i've you know  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1711) asked you honestly  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1713) do we know should we not use a really a  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1715) sledgehammer approach with this like  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1717) either if we're talking about the the  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1719) absent father  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1720) or we're talking about the weaponizing  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1722) mother yeah and either should we not  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1726) really  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1727) you know should we shouldn't really  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1728) expose these people should we not really  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1730) um  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1733) let the community know who these people  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1734) are so that they're unmarriable they  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1736) shouldn't be back because if you think  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1738) about it right if they're capable of not  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1740) seeing their children in the case of  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1741) absent father they're capable of leaving  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1743) their kids alone  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1744) uh or they're capable of weaponizing  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1747) their kids  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1748) that means that they're capable of  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1750) putting their children as humans shields  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1752) in this proverbial game of leverage uh  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1754) that means what kind of person are you  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1756) you're a narcissist you're a bad person  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1759) and you and if anyone's going to marry  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1761) you they're going to have a hell of a  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1763) life because that means you're only  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1764) going to be thinking about yourself if  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1766) you can't even think about your children  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1767) then you can't you will not think about  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1769) a partner properly you will not you will  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1771) not be  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1772) courteous and compassionate and  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1774) empathetic am i am i being a bit too  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1776) emotional with this  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1780) as i said before  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1781) the family is the unit right and our  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1784) families are under extreme pressure the  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1787) family itself is under attack at the  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1789) moment we know this and muslim families  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1791) are just  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1792) if not more under attack we are just as  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1794) as vulnerable we think we're not but we  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1797) are and for me sledgehammer  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1800) okay it's a possible approach but i am  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1803) more concerned about  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1805) us  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1806) preparing people for  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1808) properly for marriage for parenthood we  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1811) don't we still don't have enough  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1814) pre-marital counselling we don't have  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1816) enough therapy and counselling for  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1818) people oslon because that man  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1820) who went and killed his daughters  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1823) it's not just because his wife wouldn't  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1825) let him see and he had a divorce  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1826) obviously the man was hurting obviously  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1829) he was not okay so mental health big  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1832) issue counseling within the marriage  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1834) helping people to strengthen their  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1836) marriages you know to work on things  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1838) right to actually you know if then if  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1840) they can't work at it if they can't make  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1843) it work should i say then how can we  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1845) manage the separation because all i care  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1848) about is the children i'll be honest you  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1850) too you man you woman you're adults do  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1853) whatever you want you want to have a  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1854) secret marriage go ahead you want to  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1856) have monsieur go ahead you want to have  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1857) four women you want to marry  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1859) you know three men one after the other  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1861) do whatever you want but the children  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1864) the children they are the ones who  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1866) experience the fallout and so i like  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1869) though you tried to balance it there you  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1870) know you you give you give a female  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1872) example  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1874) because the reality is we can all do bad  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1877) muhammad that's the reality we can do  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1879) bad just by ourselves you know and this  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1882) this idea and i might get through yeah  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1883) but but  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1884) i might because the reality is the  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1886) reality is even if a woman for example  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1889) let's take let's assume that the woman  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1892) does not have the upper hand she has the  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1894) lower hand right the man is over her her  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1896) father is over her whatever the case may  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1898) be right do you think that that woman  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1900) does not have power to be evil  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1903) just because she doesn't have the upper  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1905) hand of course she can and i'll tell you  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1906) where you see it the most you're talking  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1908) about weaponizing your children what  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1909) about weaponizing intimacy that's a real  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1912) thing well  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1914) here's what here's what i'm going to say  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1915) look you're talking about secret second  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1917) wives i mean  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1919) if if someone's doing something like  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1920) that i would go and tell them to get  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1922) three secret second wives i mean to be  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1924) honest with you she's she's doing a  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1926) secret second one yeah i get three  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1928) because i i know this sounds  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1930) maybe harsh or something but if a woman  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1932) is doing something which is clearly  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1934) haram which is weaponizing intimacy  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1937) then a secret second wife which is uh he  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1940) means not telling the first wife which  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1942) is not even a shot in the nikah cannot  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1944) even be compared to that in the least  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1945) although due respect this is complete  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1947) they're two different uh  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1949) things altogether so if she's not doing  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1951) it and then he knows that if he's gonna  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1953) tell her that he's gonna be in polygamy  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1955) that she's gonna take his kids and go to  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1956) another country or or bar him  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1959) then maybe secret second maybe secret  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1960) second lives are the way to go for such  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1962) people i mean they're you know now yeah  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1965) what do you think  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1966) okay i i'm not gonna go down on paper  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1968) saying yes secret second wives are a  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1970) thing  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1972) but but i think again my really what i  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1975) want to say and the point i want to make  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1977) is that we must be careful of buying  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1981) into the narrative that only the  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1983) dominant party can be evil only the  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1986) dominant party can oppress only the one  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1988) who has a level higher can actually do  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1991) wrong and the person who is under is  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1993) always right is always a victim is  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1995) always you know basically not to blame  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=1998) that's not true okay it's not the fact  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2000) and anyway as we said you know and the  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2003) thing is again it's not something we  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2005) talk about very often but if you if if  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2007) you start this is this is i'll just give  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2009) you a little bit of background i have  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2011) not spoken about these issues before  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2013) because up until last year i never  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2016) listened to men anyway right muslim men  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2018) didn't really talk about their own  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2020) personal issues and just in general in  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2022) the culture the culture around us is  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2024) very female it's very very female  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2027) dominated the culture i'm not talking  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2028) about economy i'm not talking about  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2029) politics i mean the culture okay and  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2032) it's not only very female but it's also  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2034) very female centric so women's stories  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2037) dominate women's view of the world now  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2039) dominate women's ways of emoting ways of  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2042) expressing themselves they dominate the  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2044) culture that we live in western culture  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2045) right yes so it's very easy to get a  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2048) feel for what women like and what women  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2050) don't like and how women see the world  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2052) that's very easy but to find out how men  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2055) feel and how men see the world and how  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2057) men experience the world actually have  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2059) been a lot harder up until a year or two  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2062) ago certainly for me so all of this even  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2065) weaponizing intimacy i would never have  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2068) thought it was an issue because i never  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2069) heard men talking about it and of course  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2071) women are not going to talk about that  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2073) sisters are not going to sit around  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2074) saying yeah it's been three months yeah  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2077) until i get that car or anything like  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2079) that it's not gonna happen okay and you  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2081) know and to be honest you know in  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2082) certain places that might even be  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2084) applauded it's like go get yours girl  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2086) yeah  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2087) have you ever heard something like that  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2088) not amongst sisters sisters not sisters  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2090) sisters you know but just within  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2093) with intimacy  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2094) not sisters is she asexual this is not  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2097) she doesn't she want it herself or  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2098) something maybe she's maybe she's  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2102) there's lots of different no uh brother

[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2106) i mean three months  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2108) and come back what's going on three  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2110) months what's happening she doesn't want  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2112) herself if everyone's interest anyone's  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2114) interested in like knowing more about  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2115) this you just have to just search  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2117) youtube and you'll see  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2120) three months sorry sorry to say three  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2121) months is a very very it's a very big  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2124) example we should be talking about three  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2125) hours or three days like how about how  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2127) about two years  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2129) how about two weeks two years  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2134) my brother's laughing i'm really sorry  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2137) so what do you expect him to do maybe  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2139) you can't imagine it but maybe you can't  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2141) imagine it but  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2144) this is the lived reality for some men  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2146) some muslim men  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2149) then the secret second one you can't  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2150) fathom it very viable yeah you can't  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2152) fathom it  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2153) but i mean can we say it  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2156) no i i i think that if you know you are  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2160) in a situation where you know intimacy  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2162) is being withheld okay for whatever  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2165) reason right because if sharia wise and  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2168) in general in in in terms of you know  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2170) marital relationships  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2172) this would be seen as abuse not  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2173) acceptable  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2174) yeah yeah of course yeah i mean it is  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2177) domestic violence  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2178) the basic abuse probably is like  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2180) domestic violence domestic abuse but um  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2183) you know you'll see that  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2185) oh  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2187) can you pause mohammed yeah yeah

[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2191) um

[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2197) it's not live it's not live by the way  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2198) okay cool yeah oh no because i was  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2200) signed out of my account okay  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2202) but i'm still here so that's cool okay  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2205) where was i um  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2206) we're holding intimacy let's let's go  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2208) back to this okay so  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2210) um  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2214) so um so that so when i say  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2217) uh that this is something that people  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2219) are going through you will see that  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2221) obviously  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2222) in there is no space in which it is  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2224) acceptable for either partner to  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2226) withhold from the other but what we're  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2228) seeing is you know it's like  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2231) it's it's a thing weaponizing intimacy  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2234) is a thing uh may allah guide us i mean  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2236) i want to say  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2238) um  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2239) i know i'm taking up a lot of your time  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2241) i'm not going to take too much of your  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2242) time i know you're very busy but  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2245) i wanted to ask  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2247) now  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2248) the issues that we're facing a lot with  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2251) with like the females i've heard you  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2252) speak about this before i want you to  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2253) kind of articulate  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2255) the way you've heard you said it before  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2257) um the  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2259) the issues relating to like how  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2262) some sisters can perceive  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2264) what men do as always oppressive  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2268) why by virtue of this feminist kind of  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2271) second wave narrative which is that man  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2273) is the oppressor by domination because  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2276) he is he is in power over the woman the  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2278) higher the managerial hierarchy that is  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2280) set in place by  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2281) allah all these concepts they are  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2284) themselves oppressive so if you  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2286) if you so much as enact them then you  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2288) are the agent of oppression  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2291) how do you combat this how do you talk  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2293) to talk to this  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2295) you know  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2296) subhanallah  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2298) for me  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2300) the answer for me and i could be wrong  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2303) but whenever these questions come up  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2305) i feel the answer i believe that the  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2307) answer is always found in the sera  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2310) and why i say this is because the seerah  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2312) was the lived example right that was the  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2314) lived experience of our deen that's how  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2317) people actually applied it right  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2319) so you know  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2322) what we know from the seerah is balance  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2326) however what we need to be careful uh  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2330) and everybody needs to be aware of the  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2331) fact that we live in a cultural context  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2334) okay and that cultural context wherever  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2337) you are in the world whichever era you  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2339) live in it impacts the way you view  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2342) things  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2343) so in the 1950s for example  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2347) islamic values were pretty much in line  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2350) with society's values traditional gender  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2352) roles man's the head of the household  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2355) you know when daddy comes home you know  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2356) he comes and deals with the problems he  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2358) goes out to work mom stays home with the  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2359) children  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2361) muslims would not have been strange at  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2362) that time okay because the society was  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2365) pretty much based on that  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2367) fast forward to the 70s now muslims are  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2369) starting to look a bit old-fashioned  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2371) starting to look a bit out of touch  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2373) fast forward to today and our sense of  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2376) what is balance  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2378) has shifted dramatically let's put it  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2380) that way so those of us who are  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2382) especially younger  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2384) you know we're trying to make sense of  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2385) everything trying to make sense of our  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2387) identity trying to make sense of who we  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2389) are as individuals what you know what  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2391) does our islam mean to us you know how  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2393) much of you know which of our identities  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2395) takes precedence and all of these things  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2396) because those are the questions that  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2397) young people are asking now because of  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2398) the society that we live in and so what  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2402) we may see as fair what we may see as  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2405) balance what we may see as just  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2408) may not be what allah sees as fair and  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2411) balanced and just  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2413) we we have to be aware of the fact that  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2415) we live in a paradigm okay we are in a  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2416) context and a lot of people i find  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2419) a lot of us think that  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2422) our views are our own you know they come  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2425) from ourselves you know people that are  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2426) my truth i'm speaking my truth this is  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2429) this is how i see things right not  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2431) understanding that your opinion or your  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2434) ideas and your feelings etc they aren't  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2436) they didn't they're not created in a  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2437) vacuum  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2438) they're not something that sprung up  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2440) from a well within it is a  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2442) combination of what you learnt growing  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2445) up what your parents taught you what you  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2448) learned in school what books you read  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2450) what films you watch what music you  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2452) listen to the friends you have the  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2453) social media you're on all of that is  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2455) impacting you all the time and that's  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2457) your paradigm so i digress  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2460) when we look  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2461) at the we call it a managerial hierarchy  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2464) and we look at the prophet sallam i  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2466) would love to go back to example the  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2468) prophets are selling because you know  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2469) we're having this conversation about  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2470) masculinity we're having these  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2472) conversations about alpha and beta and  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2474) dominance and all of this kind of thing  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2476) and  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2477) what we see  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2478) really without any bias when we look at  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2481) the seerah we see a man who was  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2484) holistically masculine because we know  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2486) that every one of us has got masculine  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2488) and feminine tendencies inside us anyway  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2489) right we have that we have those  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2490) energies when you see the prophet sallam  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2492) and how he was able to be strong and  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2495) decisive and dominant and and and have a  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2498) goal and go after it and fight and order  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2501) for people to be punished and all of  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2502) these alpha traits right because that's  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2504) what alpha is all that's how we're  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2506) seeing it now strong dominant etc  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2509) masculine  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2511) he also had the  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2513) flip side of masculinity which is the  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2514) ability to be humble  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2517) to be protective to make people feel  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2520) safe to make people feel like you know  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2522) grounded  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2523) because that's the beta side of the male  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2526) it's not an alpha good beta bad that's  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2528) just ridiculous it's just that  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2531) you have the ability to be both right  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2533) and the prophet saws  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2534) when you see him with his family he had  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2537) a balance of both we've got stories of  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2539) him laying down the law and we've got  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2542) stories of him completely giving up his  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2544) right and it didn't mean anything we we  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2547) i don't have to go into the stories in  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2548) glacier because i think we all know what  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2549) i'm talking about and so when we look at  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2553) the ideal at the ideal that we are  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2555) aiming for especially brothers i want to  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2557) speak to brothers on this point i also  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2559) speak to sisters because sisters you  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2561) want to be married to a brother  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2562) hopefully maybe you are married to a  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2563) brother and hopefully you're raising  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2565) future husbands  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2566) so being able to appreciate that a real  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2570) man is one who  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2572) is grounded in his belief in allah and  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2575) his sense of mission and purpose  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2577) he is humble before allah and his  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2580) actions are all for allah there's no ego  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2583) right there's no ego there's no my way  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2586) or the highway because i wanted to this  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2587) should not be the way that we think  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2589) right but that man he will have to make  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2591) decisions some of those decisions you  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2593) will not like them but that's his huck  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2596) to make those decisions and that man as  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2598) well is responsible for making you feel  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2600) safe and secure and loved and protected  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2603) and looked after so  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2605) i don't know i guess the the the long  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2608) story for me is  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2610) if we can go back to that model and  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2612) understand it and know what it will take  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2614) from us to be able to embody that  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2617) standard  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2618) we'll be on our way to something special  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2620) at the moment everyone's on ego  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2622) everyone's on myself what i want what i  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2626) like women and men right now that's why  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2628) we're clashing because the sisters now  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2630) they wanted their peace right before it  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2631) was the brother wanted his peace and  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2633) everybody had to kind of run circles  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2634) around him now this is like no no no i  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2636) also want my peace and that's partly why  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2638) a lot of our marriages are fracturing  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2640) because all of a sudden  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2642) you know there's this there's this power  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2644) shift this dynamic that's shifted but  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2647) sometimes the original power dynamic was  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2649) not the healthiest dynamic and it wasn't  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2651) on sunnah it was something else  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2653) something cultural something whatever  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2655) i was going to say i was going to say um  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2657) that's really well put  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2658) the only thing i would just kind of like  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2661) talk about here well i want to i want to  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2662) kind of clarify it because  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2664) i mean you know the whole red pool  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2665) movement we've spoken about me and  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2667) alidah made a video about the mgtows and  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2668) the red pill and whatever they call  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2670) themselves you know  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2671) and these terms  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2672) are not the same thing but anyway yeah  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2675) they have very similar ideas you know  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2677) but red pool have their ideas mgtow have  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2679) their ideas a lot of it is is a reaction  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2682) to feminism in my view but anyway  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2685) you know  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2686) whatever it may be  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2687) the the terms alpha and beta the reason  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2689) why i personally don't use them or don't  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2691) subscribe to them  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2692) is because so what they because there is  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2695) a connotation just like with the  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2696) patriarchy you know i don't accept the  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2698) term patriarchy the the reason why i  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2700) don't accept the term patriarchy like  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2702) some men use the term in a positive  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2704) sense they're trying to re-own the word  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2705) or something like that  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2706) the word patriarchy has historically and  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2709) in the literature always  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2710) connoted at least if not sometimes even  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2713) they've been defined as a systematic  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2716) oppression of woman by men or through  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2719) domination or power structures  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2721) yeah now if i'm if i'm affirming  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2722) something which is  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2724) known in the in the culture to be  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2725) oppressive then i'm not doing a favor to  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2728) the model of islam which i'm trying to  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2729) to espouse likewise the word beta here  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2733) it has we're not reclaiming the word  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2735) beta no no no i don't want to reclaim  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2737) any because it's already been it's  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2738) already been  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2740) distorted by the commandments yeah

[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2752) media thing  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2753) uh it's being used in a pejorative sense

[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2776) called the prophet muhammad sallam a  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2777) beta male okay  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2781) i know that you i know that you if you  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2784) were very careful uh in your  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2786) articulation and definitely she didn't  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2788) say that  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2789) that would be lying about you anyway  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2791) don't worry you didn't say that but what  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2792) i was going to say was  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2794) um the qualities that are like  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2796) compassion for example compassion  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2798) compassion is associated with what maybe  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2800) beta but this is something which is for  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2802) us for seeing as allah is  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2803) what is here  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2807) as an insult  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2809) you're using the beta as an insult yeah  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2811) yeah that is the problem  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2815) another one is as leadership  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2817) and this whole thing of alpha alpha one  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2819) of the things that i'm always seeing on  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2820) these social media things that alpha  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2822) male is a leader  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2823) our religion doesn't tell us to go and  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2825) opt to be leaders  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2826) honestly it does not tell us to go and  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2828) want to be leaders our religion places  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2830) more emphasis on obedience than anything  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2832) else not just for women but for men as  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2833) well  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2834) and not obedience to not obedience to  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2837) just  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2840) that there's no obedience to the  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2842) creation and the disobedience of the  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2843) creator but also obedience to the  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2845) creation there's very harsh hadiths  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2850) you have to be strong with the  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2851) you have to uh obey the will  
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2855) and um yeah  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2856) so what is it telling us there's only  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2858) one ayah in the quran only one that i  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2860) can think of which is the dua to be a  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2862) leader which is  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2865) the one verse number one time  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2868) we are  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2869) kind of incentivized if at all  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2871) incentivized to be leaders is what allah  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2873) is pushing us to make a dua where we  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2874) don't get it from our own life because  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2876) being a leader is being arrogant is what  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2878) you want to be a leader why so you can  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2880) assert yourself you can be dominant who  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2882) you want to be dominant  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2884) we're trying to imp like we're trying to  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2886) do a lot of kalimata we're trying to  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2889) make allah's kalam dominance not  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2891) ourselves dominant  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2892) so in fact  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2895) whoever humbles himself to allah allah  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2897) raises him so this idea of  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2899) leaders and this and that  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2901) usually those people who are most hungry  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2903) to be leaders are the worst leaders  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2904) anyway  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2905) you know the ones who are good leaders  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2907) they never think of themselves as good  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2909) leaders they people push them to that  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2911) position they never opt for that  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2912) position themselves so the this idea of  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2915) what's alpha is connected with the  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2917) leader this is an islamic actually oh  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2920) hold on i'm going to push back on that  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2921) i'm going to push back you should not  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2923) let me let me let me clear up you  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2924) clarify before you can reflect what i  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2926) mean is you should not desire leadership  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2929) you can be a good leader but you don't  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2931) need to desire it desiring it is  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2933) problematic because it is a form of i  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2936) want to impose myself on other people  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2938) but yeah our deen is not about power  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2940) like that our deal is about we just okay  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2943) that's that's the yeah that's the point  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2944) that i want to get to because i think  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2946) that you know even in you know certain  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2949) discourses right the issue of of um you  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2952) know male dominance etc  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2955) so everything is about power right  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2958) and  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2959) when we look at leadership  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2962) in the dean  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2963) looking at the shepherd for example  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2965) every one of you is a shepherd of their  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2966) flock and you'll be questioned about  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2967) them what does that mean it's not  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2969) leading to dominate it's leading to take  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2972) responsibility  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2973) so every man is the emir of his  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2975) household he leads the household because  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2978) he takes responsibility  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2980) as well  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2982) exactly  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2984) you know everyone has every one of us is  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2986) a shepherd right so i mean i i i  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2989) personally i would love to see more of  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2992) our brothers developing themselves to be  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2994) the very best that they can be  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=2997) and leading their families because even  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3000) though we have a big  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3002) you know very loud maybe minority  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3004) complaining about toxic masculinity we  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3007) have also a very vocal i would even say  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3009) majority of sister saying where are the  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3011) men  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3012) where are the men who know how to be men  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3016) what does that mean as far as they're  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3017) concerned who can take care of the  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3019) household who can lead us who can  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3021) protect us who will bust his his  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3024) backside to make sure that we have what  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3026) we need because sisters are overworked  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3028) right now and sisters have been  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3030) overworked for a while and again again  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3032) it's all anecdotal  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3034) but when you hear about sisters whose  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3036) husbands he could even be present but  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3039) she's she's doing everything she's you  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3041) know getting money for the kids is her  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3043) house she's working as well you know the  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3045) money is coming from the government and  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3047) he's not really kind of bringing  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3048) anything to the table etc these issues a  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3051) lot of those sisters that i said i just  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3052) wish he would grow up i just wish that  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3054) he would man up and i know it's it's not  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3057) like it's not politically correct to  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3058) tell a man to man up but this is this is  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3061) what women need we do need men who see  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3064) themselves in that role as i'm  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3066) responsible for this flock and it's my  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3069) responsibility to myself to optimize  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3071) myself in every way that i can so that i  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3074) can do right by these this manner that  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3076) allah has given me so i think if you  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3078) were to see more brothers stepping up  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3080) and deciding to work on themselves dean  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3083) emotionally getting you know and mental  
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3085) health issues out of the way physically  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3087) you know getting healthy you know  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3089) finding ways to kind of maximize their  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3091) income and the impact they have in the  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3092) community you would find a lot more  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3095) sisters who are happy to let them lead  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3097) and happy to relax into their feminine  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3099) role and it wouldn't be this type of  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3101) fight but i could be wrong no no i  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3103) appreciate all of that and i think  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3104) you've articulated it very well but i  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3106) think there's one thing which is  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3108) conspicuously missing in the  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3109) articulation  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3110) which is that we you've mentioned health  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3112) you mentioned mental health and you  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3113) mentioned uh  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3115) you you've mentioned finances but that  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3117) the one thing which is that the dean  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3119) actually hierarchizes  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3121) is not any of those things but it's  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3123) i did mention spiritually at the  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3125) beginning it was the first thing i said  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3126) actually i did but okay let me be more  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3128) clear about this right so allah he  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3131) mentions  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3132) he mentions  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3143) he raises amongst you those who have  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3145) believed among you and those who have  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3146) been given  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3148) knowledge  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3150) this knowledge islamic knowledge  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3156) as you know the hadith very famous  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3158) whoever wants good allah who wants good  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3160) for them allah he gives them knowledge  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3162) of the religion or understanding of the  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3163) religion even yeah  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3164) now the thing is like when men are  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3167) looking for women to get married to or  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3169) women are looking to men this whole red  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3170) pill community what do they favor oh

[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3176) a good-looking woman is not important  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3178) i'm not saying a a a rich husband is not  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3181) it's not good to have but what i'm  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3183) saying is that when the prophet muhammad  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3185) said  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3188) that the woman is married for four  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3189) things  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3206) but be successful with the one who is  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3209) religious now why is this important  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3211) because you know and now we he mentions  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3214) in  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3214) this hadith  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3216) he says it when when the prophet  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3218) muhammad said  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3227) he's not saying you should marry a woman  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3229) for four things  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3230) he's saying that these are the four  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3232) things ah these are the four things that  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3233) women are married for but and the  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3235) prophet said okay these are important he  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3238) didn't say like you know go for the one  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3239) who's most beautiful who's eight out of  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3240) ten or nine or ten he didn't say go with  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3242) the one who's got the most money he says  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3244) go with the one who's most religious  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3246) now the same thing applies for the woman  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3248) like you can have someone who doesn't  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3250) have as much money who might be in a  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3252) council property who might be whatever  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3254) but he's he's a man of piety he's known  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3257) in the community you know i'm trying to  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3258) say he's memorized the quran he's done  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3260) this he's done that  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3262) that person  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3263) okay is higher if if his class is in  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3266) place  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3267) in the hierarchy that allah has put for  
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3269) him  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3272) so  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3273) i think a lot of these disciples get  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3274) colored with  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3276) a capitalistic lens and we have to  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3277) really be careful because this is not  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3279) ours it's like feminism it creeps in but  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3281) we have to remember what is the  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3283) hierarchy the prophet muhammad hadith  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3286) um he mentioned  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3296) that the whole dunya is cursed and  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3298) everything inside of it is cursed except  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3300) for the remembrance of allah and someone  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3302) who is a teacher who knows and he was a  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3304) teacher and someone who's learning so  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3307) there's three there's three things you  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3308) want in your life  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3309) of allah  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3310) and you want  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3312) to teach the deen which is the most  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3314) important thing even though other  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3316) knowledges are important as well because  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3317) the prophet salallahu  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3328) but you know so this is a thing that  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3329) sometimes in these discords we're  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3330) talking about men need to be men  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3333) what do do we mean that they need to  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3334) start studying the religion by that do  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3336) we mean that they need to start going to  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3337) pray to pray five times a day by that  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3339) wake up for fajr by that do we mean that  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3341) when the quran says  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3344) you know and then  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3346) from the the the the mutmans are rijal  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3350) uh oh sorry the other area which talks  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3355) which refers which which links  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3357) masculinity with with cleanliness what's  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3359) what's that link  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3360) what's that got to do with alpha and  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3362) beta sorry nothing's it if you go on the  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3364) quran just forget about the sorry to say  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3366) but just go to the quran  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3368) and look at what there's 23 or 24  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3370) instances with where the radical rajulan  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3371) is mentioned  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3373) i mentioned anytime  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3375) the word man is mentioned look at what  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3377) it's connected to it's connected to iman  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3379) it's connected to  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3381) cleanliness  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3383) it's connected to  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3385) uh  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3386) protection  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3387) and maintenance like what you've said  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3389) but what we what we do  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3391) sometimes we just focus on that one  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3392) thing which is  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3394) we forget about all the rest  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3396) you know what can i just say i i hear  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3398) you and i and i agree with you given you  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3400) know expanded my thinking on it as well  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3402) mashaallah but i i think  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3405) i don't know what it's like now because  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3407) i think that the  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3408) the landscape has changed so much from  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3411) when we were kind of coming up because  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3414) when we were coming up it was very clear  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3417) who was on dean and who wasn't  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3419) sisters got hijab  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3421) you were safe to make certain making  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3423) yourself out to be like a older woman  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3425) sister like what you're wondering yes i  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3427) am no no no i told you i'm an otg i'm an  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3430) auntie  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3438) it was safe to make certain assumptions  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3440) about her lifestyle about her values  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3442) about the kind of marriage she was  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3444) looking for similarly if her brother had  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3446) a beard and a soap and he went to pray  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3448) at the masjid it was safe to make  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3450) certain assumptions about what he  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3452) expected in a marriage the role he was  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3454) going to play his lifestyle etc my  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3457) friend those days are gone those days  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3460) are gone  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3461) those days are gone because  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3464) we are such a mix of the elements right  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3467) now you've got sisters in hijab in the  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3470) club  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3471) you've got brothers in  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3473) selling drugs you know  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3475) you've got you know this one here with  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3477) the pornography addiction you've got  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3479) that one over there who's kind of you  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3480) know messing about with girls  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3482) it's it's completely  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3484) it's no longer black and white so and i  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3487) think as well  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3488) people experienced this idea of marrying  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3491) only for dean and let's be fair it's the  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3494) appearance isn't it of dean and that's  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3496) the danger because a lot of people did  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3498) have the appearance of dean  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3500) meanwhile they've got mental health  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3502) issues meanwhile they've got anger  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3504) management issues meanwhile she she's  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3506) you know she's angry with the kids and  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3507) she beats them when she doesn't look  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3508) after the house nice  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3510) stuff happening yeah so  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3512) i agree with you the dean should be a  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3515) priority however  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3517) there is a danger of us becoming  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3520) kind of  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3521) fooled by people's exteriors it's not  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3524) that simple anymore because as i said  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3526) even though the muslims that you see now  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3528) if you bring a whole group of practicing  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3529) muslims together who are don't all go to  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3531) the same places you'll find that their  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3533) virgin their views on things are  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3535) different their lifestyles are different  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3537) they're certain things they consider to  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3538) be just fine certain things that i want  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3540) to marry like this on a marriage like  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3541) that so it's not so simple anymore um  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3544) and i think that people need to be  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3545) really honest with themselves and  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3547) realize that the appearance of dean on  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3549) somebody's external is not all there is  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3552) to know about that person you do need to  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3554) do your due diligence you need to peel  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3555) back the layers and we need to be honest  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3557) with ourselves  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3559) that's that's what we need to do we have  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3560) to have the dean as a standard yes  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3563) all i'm saying is we're not in a place  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3565) anymore where you can say she looks  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3566) religious i'll marry her oh no  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3569) you can't do that he looks religious  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3570) mashallah i've you know how many times  
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3572) i've heard head sisters marrying  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3574) brothers who have mental health issues  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3577) yeah bipolar schizophrenia anger  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3580) management whatever but what did they

[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3583) brother mashallah is a good brother he's  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3585) always in the masjid praying what does

[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3593) the dark  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3594) i'm sorry i can't accept just that as a  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3596) witness i i have to get a bit more  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3598) information than that you know and same  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3599) with the sister the sisters are crazy  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3601) out there sisters who literally have  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3604) mental health issues and they mashallah  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3606) wrap up really nicely covered in hijab  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3609) everything mashallah sister  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3610) salaamwalekum everything everything you  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3612) marry that sister you find that she's  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3613) actually crazy so  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3616) that's all i'm saying it's it's not as  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3617) simple as that anymore  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3619) stuff out there that's why i said  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3621) protecting the family unit  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3623) by making sure that we are all healing  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3626) firstly and that's that's big  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3628) because so many of us are carrying  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3630) traumas and and it's not like our  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3632) parents generation you know i had this  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3634) conversation with fatima about katala in  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3636) our ilm feed podcast and i talked about  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3637) our parents and our grandparents  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3640) their lives were much harder than ours  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3642) right much harder i'm sure your  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3643) grandparents had had you know they may  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3645) have gone through some wars you know the  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3648) immigration the racism the you know  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3650) poverty living on the streets all this  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3652) kind of thing but when you ask them  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3654) about it it's a long gone memory they  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3656) don't even remember it and they  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3657) certainly don't say i was scarred for  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3660) life like i i've never gotten over it  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3663) it's like it was life that's what  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3665) happened i think you know what it is  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3667) neymar on this point  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3668) do you know do you know like a lot of  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3670) today's conversations to cut you off  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3671) please remember where you stopped yeah  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3673) a lot of what you said today you  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3675) mentioned like key term we talked about  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3677) the patriarchy and how it can be  
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3678) misappropriated or it can be misused and  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3681) or if it is used it has some negative  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3684) connotation we talked about alpha beta  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3685) on the other flip side but this this  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3688) term trauma which has become almost a  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3689) buzzword now as well i feel like that  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3692) itself can be  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3693) it can reinforce the bad memory like oh  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3695) i have traumas  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3697) like the lexicon has changed to the  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3699) extent where the lexicon has changed  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3701) yeah there's trauma there's triggered  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3704) yeah triggers like a trauma yeah exactly  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3707) and what that does is it just it's kind  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3708) of like  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3709) if anything sometimes it can have a  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3711) negative it can have it can have an  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3712) adverse effect because it's just it's  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3714) like like you said  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3717) all my all my grandparents are gone now  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3719) but when i was when i was speaking to  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3720) them when they were alive or even my  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3723) parents you know  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3724) they don't speak in that language that  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3726) language is unusual that is unusual  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3728) language because  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3729) the presupposition is almost that we  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3732) shouldn't be it's like we're entitled to  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3734) a life without trial that's the  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3735) presupposed world problems yeah yeah  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3739) but even first world problems like the  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3741) people in the first world think that  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3742) they shouldn't be trialed like  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3744) this  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3747) the quran says people think that they'll  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3748) just be left alone to say we believe and  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3750) they will not be trialed  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3752) you know and the reality is like that  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3754) you know the trials of this life are for  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3756) everyone you know every one of us not  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3758) just the believers disbelievers muslim  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3760) men women young old everybody everyone's  
[1:02:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3763) going to get a piece of life says in his  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3765) book  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3766) um it's a very good book some of it has  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3768) been translated  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3770) it's one of the best books you can  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3771) probably read on these matters and he  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3773) was talking about like  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3775) um  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3776) the trials and stuff and he was it was  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3777) he was basically describing the dunya as  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3779) a combination of heaven and hell  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3781) basically if you uh he's not that he  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3784) didn't put it in that language like i am  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3786) paraphrasing okay but if you put  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3788) evidence together you have done if you  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3789) want to put it you know it's i like that  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3791) that that make that yeah i like that you  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3793) know what i mean is there's a reason why  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3796) there's a reason why there's a bit of  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3798) hell in the bit of heaven in this dunya  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3800) it's like allah didn't give us either or  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3802) gave us both because  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3804) it's it's the place it's the testing  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3806) ground  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3807) for the graduation to take place and it  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3809) will test it we'll see you the true  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3810) colors we were talking about certain  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3812) things happen which expose people's true  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3814) colors  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3815) yeah this dunya is the is the biggest  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3817) thing that happens which expose all of  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3819) our spiritual true colors  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3821) of judgment is what's going to put us  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3822) it's where the results of of  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3825) that is going to be manifest  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3827) 100 i mean i think you know this uh this  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3829) issue of and again this is why i keep  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3831) talking about the cultural context that  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3833) we live in because it does affect us you  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3835) know we can't none of us can say  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3837) very few of us and i think only those  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3839) few are the ones who are steeped in  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3842) islamic knowledge and that's a tiny  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3844) minority of us majority of us yeah just  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3846) me and my friends actually now  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3847) [Laughter]  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3849) you heard it here  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3852) um  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3853) steeped in islamic knowledge  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3855) and the your islamic knowledge informs  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3859) your thinking it your islamic knowledge  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3861) is actually the thing that is your  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3863) thinking is rooted in that  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3865) it's a tiny handful of people in the  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3867) world yeah because because you read  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3869) quran doesn't mean that your thinking is  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3871) like rooted in islam it's not the case  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3873) yeah but what my point is that  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3876) even you know and i i've been  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3877) transparent about this you know at the  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3879) end of the day i'm not a scholar i'm  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3880) just a person  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3882) um  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3883) and you know for example hierarchies i  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3885) always talk about maslow's hierarchy of  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3887) me yeah yeah  
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3889) honey we're just trying our best but  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3890) maslow's hierarchy of needs i find is  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3892) very very um very instructive and i know  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3896) because people have said that's not our  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3898) hierarchy of needs we have a different  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3900) hierarchy just to explain to the viewers  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3902) just because this might be something  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3904) they don't know it's basically a  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3906) triangular structure at the bottom of  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3908) which is like you know you have your  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3909) basic needs like shelter  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3912) whatever and at the top of the pinnacle  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3914) of this triangular structure is  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3915) something called self-actualization and  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3917) according to maslow people like einstein  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3919) would have  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3919) have achieved this self-actualization  
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3921) people like i don't know choose whoever  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3923) you want fill in the blank you know  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3925) successful so-called successful goats  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3927) basically the goats  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3929) the goats and whatever but it's good  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3930) it's good like you said it is i think  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3932) that's a good way to put it is  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3933) definitely instructive because  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3935) it gives us something to  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3937) to opt for the islam sorry the quran is  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3939) in the hadith where the prophet muhammad  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3941) has his own triangular  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3943) structure which is  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3945) islam and then the five pillars  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3947) and then the six pillars then yeah  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3955) you know we've got our own one but  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3956) certainly i think is destructive as well  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3959) yeah  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3959) keep going that's interesting to me so  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3961) what's interesting to me with this  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3963) hierarchy of needs um at the bottom is  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3966) basic needs food shelter uh you know  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3969) food drink shelter i think it is um i  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3971) think intimacy is in there  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3973) yeah next up from that is emotional  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3976) needs i believe uh and then it's sort of  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3979) uh i think it's not professional but  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3981) it's like mission and then self actually  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3983) social structures  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3987) guys go and google it please it's there  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3989) for everyone to see but my point is this  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3992) is that  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3993) my observation is that when the lower  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3996) people are on the hierarchy of needs as  
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=3999) in if you're still at basic needs level  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4002) it's very easy to be satisfied because  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4004) all you need is your basic needs to be  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4006) met  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4007) once you have transcended basic needs  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4009) and you start to go into higher pursuits  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4012) the higher you go  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4014) and the higher you aim on that triangle  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4017) the more likely you are to be frustrated  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4020) and disappointed because not everybody  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4022) reaches the top of that triangle some  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4024) people stay on the basic level some  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4026) people will go up to having their  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4027) emotional needs met but there are  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4028) children even today who don't get their  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4030) emotional needs met we know this okay  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4032) maybe they have a home maybe their  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4034) parents feed them they make sure they go  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4036) to school but their emotional needs are  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4037) not being met maybe the parents don't  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4039) know how to do it maybe the parents  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4040) themselves never had the emotional needs  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4042) met whatever the case may be anyway i  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4043) digress  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4045) my point is  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4046) we need to be careful because we're  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4048) living in a world where that bottom is  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4051) done first world problems means that  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4053) we're always looking at  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4055) self-actualization we're looking at you  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4056) know me you know kind of finding myself  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4059) and and becoming the better version of  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4061) myself and and  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4062) and and and usually not in a religious  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4064) way but in other ways right  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4066) i think my concern for my community  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4070) is that we aim so high  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4072) that we  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4073) firstly neglect to be grateful for what  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4075) we have  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4077) and we also are not able to be satisfied  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4080) so we are constantly chasing the dragon  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4083) and that means that we're always in this  
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4086) perpetual state of chasing after the  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4088) dunya because that's what it is it's  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4090) chasing dunya and that dunya could be  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4093) the relationship  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4094) it could be money it could be uh you  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4097) know a certain lifestyle it could be  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4099) academic pursuits whatever it is right  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4102) but  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4102) i just want us to be  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4105) circumspect i think and try to have a  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4107) balanced approach to it because even in  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4109) relationships we're seeing it you know  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4111) people expect more from their  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4112) relationships now than they did 20 years  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4114) ago even muslims and i think that is one  
[1:08:37](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4117) of the other reasons that is driving  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4118) high divorce rates in the community  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4120) because one partner has a higher  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4122) expectation for the relationship than  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4124) the other and the other one is perfectly  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4127) satisfied listen  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4129) we're together  
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4131) you cook for me  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4133) i've got wonderful kids  
[1:08:55](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4135) i'm happy i'm good  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4137) she's like we don't do date nights  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4140) you never listen to me  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4141) you don't really see me i feel like you  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4143) don't appreciate me i want more  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4146) i want a best friend i want a companion  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4149) i want all new things yeah these are new  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4151) things because when they first got  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4153) together this was not the conversation  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4154) when they first got together it was  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4156) bismillah for the sake of allah you're  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4158) going to give me your rights you're  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4159) going to give me my rights i'm going to  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4160) give you your rights it's easy yeah  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4162) because remember back in the day that's  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4163) what everybody thought a successful  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4165) marriage is what two people get married  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4167) for the sake of allah they fulfill each  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4168) other's rights happily ever after that's  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4170) what people thought  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4171) but the more we want and the more we  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4173) demand from our partners and i'm going  
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4175) to switch this because i don't want to  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4176) be accused of bias  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4178) let me switch it  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4180) say it say it say we want to hear that  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4182) we want to hit a few more problems as  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4183) well yeah i'm going to say so the sister  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4185) is no this is not this is the husband's  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4187) problem because the sister's problem a  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4188) lot of the time is  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4190) you know she has a vision for her life  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4192) and a vision for her relationship but  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4194) her husband doesn't meet her there  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4196) anymore like maybe her vision was here  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4198) before once she starts to elevate that  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4200) vision he's not following her he's like  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4203) what are you doing all that for like  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4204) you're doing too much just relax we're

[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4209) she's she's evolving she's becoming a  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4211) different person so that has caused a  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4213) lot of friction and i've seen this more  
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4215) and more in the community right so  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4217) that's that  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/ELwvnd2b-Zs?t=4218) flip side
