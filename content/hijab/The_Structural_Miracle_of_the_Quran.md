[0:00:00](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=0) and patina people ability age would you  
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=8) a party so they wanted to focus on  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=12) another part of the world called Islamic  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=16) proof yeah which is the structural  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=21) coherence of the plan which is something  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=24) which is kind of not really spoken about  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=26) too much the structural provision of art  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=28) I personally believe that it offers  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=31) another layer of very powerful  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=32) argumentation for someone to promote  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=36) Islam I basically added another layer of  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=39) evidence for the Islamic charity once  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=43) again here before we start is an  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=46) important caveat that to put forward  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=48) which is that Iran itself wasn't result  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=51) Buddha long ago so the property was 40  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=53) years old when he know the promise to go  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=57) to him in the bath shut up  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=58) and obviously the span of 23 years he  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=62) received the bronze piece meal like  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=65) piece by piece until he died at the age  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=67) of 63  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=68) now this itself is interesting okay this  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=71) is this is healthy interesting why  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=74) because the thing is you realize that  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=76) before on despite it being completed in  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=79) terms of its structure and despite it  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=83) being also something which we know ended  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=87) when it needed to be ended  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=89) absolutely Maya in the Quran it says in  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=91) chapter 5 verse 2 it says and you'll  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=93) make mint electric vehicle we're at  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=95) Mount Wellington amateur only two level  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=97) disseminated in a suspected religion and  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=99) I complete multiple to use exception so  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=102) in other words the Quranic message was  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=105) fully revealed yeah this is a ton of  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=108) evidence for the validity of his life  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=112) what was in chapter 5 verse 67 underpins  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=115) a lot of analysis it says yeah you had  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=121) yeah you know so well that man what did  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=123) I like am a robbery  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=124) what is a  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=126) forever last an eternity well no me a  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=128) single community says that Oh profit  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=132) basically say to the people that which  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=136) you have revealed to you from your Lord  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=140) or has come down to you from your Lord  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=142) and if you don't do this and you have  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=144) not put forward or you have lost you  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=146) have not basically fulfilled your  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=147) mission sending the message and then the  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=151) interesting last part of the area is  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=152) well love we are similar I mean an  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=155) entity that certainly Allah will protect  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=157) you from the people the Prophet Mohammed  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=161) Salim was engaged in warfare on a yearly  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=164) basis I think if you count it probably  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=167) about two wars a year so he had an equal  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=170) chance to be killed at each time each  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=172) time please but what I would say alone  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=175) protect you from the people together so  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=178) the first point of interest here is half  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=181) considered and by the Midway how could  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=183) anyone guarantee that year it's not like  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=186) today's lot of the profit actually where  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=188) does it was mercy for the most part in  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=190) light manservant with defensive war yeah  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=193) so there was thought when the program  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=195) was going out that he was going on him  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=196) so it wasn't people going on his body  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=199) when he went out each time of the times  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=202) you'd be killed each time each every  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=204) time you become how come is the puranas  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=207) being so confident here is saying that  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=210) alone protect you from the people and  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=213) otherwise you'll be protected you will  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=214) not be killed this is an interesting  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=216) thing and a very confident thing to do  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=218) mysterious fact it had amounts of  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=221) prediction of the future and it shows  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=223) you once again the veracity and the  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=226) validity of the Atlantic message another  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=229) thing that came to my mind was in gaja  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=233) resulting issue of death in chapter 2  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=237) and chapter 52 the Prophet Muhammad and  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=241) basically using human interaction with  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=243) Jewish tribes at the time and then many  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=247) of them there was peace agreement who  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=250) are broken apparently  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=253) so the client came to America criticized  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=256) those particular Jews at the time of 100  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=258) yet and basically as you may know the  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=263) lot of the Jewish people believe in that  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=266) now the chosen few that so I lost my  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=270) data  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=271) he sends down in Sioux possible for  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=273) unwanted you know if you think that you  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=278) are basically the chosen people says  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=280) mala sentimental notes so rich was dead  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=284) yeah and it's my son of it what's going  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=288) on but there was a good company they  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=290) saying which would end and then is  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=293) something interesting and that's  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=295) technically a intricacies of what I had  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=297) meant no no more evident department ID  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=299) you will never be able to do whenever we  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=303) wish to a hopeful of death because of  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=306) what their hands and forth and so just  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=309) assume about whether men know whether  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=311) the mother without the two moons very  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=313) rate this is a matter it's really that  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=315) they were never really asked for that so  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=320) I sit there and I ask that because of  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=322) what they hadn't before not was got to  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=324) do anything basically saying making a  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=327) prediction that those particularly  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=329) Jewish people who had broken the peace  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=331) agreement would never say I want to die  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=335) basically  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=335) the DS word I don't like if a Jewish  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=338) person came out and said this will occur  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=340) while he did it it every age you know  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=344) Islamic and this was clay animosity  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=347) because at one point there was the  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=348) breathing of the peace agreement they  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=350) could have easily come up that shows you  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=351) because the ranchers and other part of  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=353) Iraq yeah well can we have connect now  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=356) basically know him like they know their  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=358) fun  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=359) so otherwise the party was asserting  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=361) that those particular Jews believe that  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=363) our farmers true right but that they  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=366) would never come on say it openly in  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=369) that way with a publicly claimed that it  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=372) will never come up and say that we want  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=374) to die that's a prediction of the future  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=375) we can easily be disproven  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=378) all that it needs is one person to come  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=380) out reduce to be those diseases use  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=383) people and say you know I I want to buy  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=388) every night you know literally that's  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=390) what I wouldn't have to happen and then  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=392) under being destroyed but that didn't  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=395) happen which does show or think that you  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=398) also go for I'm new the psychologies of  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=400) the people and this you know this once  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=404) again Republicans of this councils for  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=407) example one is in Navarre of Maria which  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=410) in some aggressive attack from before  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=412) the crime war lost her Allah he  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=414) mentioned in the film I put it again  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=418) this this whole narrative of wisdom in  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=421) real  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=422) basically the Quran is saying became his  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=426) legacy of my renewal really function how  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=430) far  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=430) maybe he's hoping a diet for his lamb so  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=433) once again he could have discredited  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=435) Islam I come before you think our  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=437) cameras let me know you know and if they  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=439) didn't have a lot that we can I'm glad  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=441) know like with that this purse you could  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=444) have come forward at admit but look what  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=445) I was saying generally that is not a so  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=448) this is something which we could  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=449) possibly refer back to the old better  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=451) because it goes into kind of like a  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=453) prediction of future by also demonstrate  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=457) that the author of the Quran he knew the  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=460) psychologism that he would be and he's  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=463) challenging you to be I mean think of it  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=465) this is a sudden reading which I find  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=467) fascinating letter so I if it charges  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=470) you invades with great confidence do  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=471) certain things or when it's hopes of the  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=474) future so very confidently and you know  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=477) this is a part of the narrative here or  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=481) the evidence base we use to show up Iran  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=484) has it also which knows the future  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=486) basically so this is pretty why  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=490) what is you know something about the  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=491) structure before not specifically which  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=492) all is it so high idle bit which is  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=494) interesting as we said the park in peace  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=497) in your then someone Alonso gang but  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=500) despite a thunder for i attain peace by  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=502) peace you will find that there are  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=505) incredible

[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=514) at a time when circumstances which no  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=517) further predicted because some of them  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=519) contain questions inside of them which  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=521) the prophets have had to basically hunt  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=523) on the spot so there are lots of  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=525) questions that a proper was asked and he  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=527) had to answer in the form of the prime  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=530) mechanical they ask you about the sole  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=532) successor yes a lunar handbook burning  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=534) he asked you about opening chapter 18  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=537) and black the lunar calendar related  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=539) they asked you about drinking and  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=541) gambling in chapters of the Quran yes  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=544) and like a hill then they asked you  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=546) about the new moons yes a lunar hand  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=548) legitimately ask you what you see so  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=551) each time the planning to come forward  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=553) and basically provide an answer so it  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=556) couldn't have been pre-planned mounted  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=557) by I in mind when I tell you now that  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=560) the Quran is composed of 114 chapters if  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=564) you look properly you'll find that the  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=567) Quran in the beginning to the end is  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=570) punched into two different groups the  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=571) paralyzes thoughts inside I think by and  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=574) I was reading a book remaining  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=576) instragram us by surprise this person  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=579) actually comes a very conclusion Asian  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=581) cuisines moderate iron over fire yet and  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=584) what willful destruction of others never  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=586) I was quite interested in his  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=588) observation probably having a good  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=590) school destruction for Annapurna and he  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=592) was saying that one had an interesting  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=596) structure and that basing your finally  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=599) the Puranas compartment I'll into  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=601) different groups and this is my let me  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=604) holla if you think it's it's really over  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=605) like if you look into the night sky and  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=607) you look at a star you find no clear  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=610) pattern maybe on first sight but if you  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=612) look more closely you'll find that they  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=614) are arranged into the constellations now  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=616) collided something thinner because if  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=619) you let us with the bottom for example  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=620) yeah so the pocket very similar  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=623) which is right in the people being  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=626) sequencing of those so tested to is very  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=629) solicitous of dream in its lexical  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=631) phrases edits and it basically is  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=635) composition and file all related very  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=638) similar chapter 3 and chapter 4 other  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=640) seminars check before her so all of the  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=643) sort that I actually arranged XP channel  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=645) you'll find that the tape or the flavor  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=648) of the surah is similar to the sort of  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=650) axonal for insulin that comes after it  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=652) and this is very very interesting on the  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=654) acquiring discourse you'll find out also  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=659) in addition to this reality and this is  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=661) something I rented this interesting book  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=663) was it going to be the Western  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=667) communities completely by each other  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=668) because a Muslim then with Neil Robbins  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=670) again here at McConnell available camp  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=673) the company I already read the chapter  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=677) so far structure I just wanted to get  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=679) you know and only after the suspect how  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=681) are we going but basically he says that  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=685) in his views and he looked at the world  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=687) some is markers one person I think who's  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=689) even Indian person yet and he said that  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=692) each each surah he called it the  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=696) steering Duff tells the next Iran which  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=699) is chatter LeBron is connected  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=701) intricately with the next chapters the  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=703) beginning and ending of the chapters are  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=704) connected and the ending of white  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=706) chapters connect it with the next  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=707) chapter  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=708) now this is really interesting because  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=710) if you think about it if you really  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=712) think about it how could it be arranged  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=715) in that way if you don't know what the  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=716) future is going to be simple question  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=718) how can you spend your time arranging  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=721) the Quran and a particular way if you  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=724) don't know what the future is going to  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=725) be I mean you want easy example one  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=726) thing suppose the fun happens with guide  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=730) us to the straight path the part of you  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=732) those of you are failures cattitude  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=734) starts with basically who then is not  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=736) appear which is the people USA ends with  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=738) good people as well this says you know  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=741) when what we learn in the same chatter  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=743) bus  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=743) justice unrelated littlez's mother and  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=746) chapter and so far that boxes work the  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=749) books of previous appearances until the  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=751) landfill air live with all our unique  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=753) session in the next chapter chapter  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=755) three includes other books Windsor r87  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=758) will happen so Tiffany Robin a day when  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=760) the two are two ng shows what the books  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=762) and the messages which are connected and  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=764) then at the end of the surah chapter 3  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=767) it looks once again about in SM America  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=770) where the many Romanian analytic film  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=774) about a particular topic which is called  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=776) Mohammed so it's all the dovetails you  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=779) could say well-connected entertaining in  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=781) such a way a whole necklace one of it is  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=784) intricately connected to the next part  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=787) were puzzled really all of it put  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=789) together perfectly to create the  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=792) overarching image as a question that you  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=796) can duck is and why did I happen to be  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=798) like that when the author of them or SEO  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=801) for the problems human being and listing  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=802) man who is in a situation to me  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=806) circumstantially and he was basically  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=809) forced to respond on the spot how could  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=812) it be that he had the time or even the  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=814) ability to connect it together  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=816) intimately this equation and you'll find  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=819) almost look no exception that the Quran  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=822) has this secretly you don't so the fact  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=827) I even sometimes a lot if you look at  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=829) social analysis as a one ago Quran which  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=831) we believe it was  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=832) despite its brevity it is the most  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=836) powerful slow Gibran if you look at this  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=838) salon it's composed of seven hands seven  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=840) area and in the southern had to find  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=843) that there are three different kinds of  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=846) reports first of all to like it talks  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=849) about God in the third person and then  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=851) it moves to second person narrative  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=853) voice and so it is interesting  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=855) transition or what you put an advocate  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=859) effect which is a little return come  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=862) back really  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=863) this insight is really interesting in  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=865) the second point is you'll find that  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=867) there are three different types of and  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=870) this is going to fail technical juggling  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=873) there but if you can just be patient a  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=875) little bit with absolutely no basically  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=879) you have generally think it's you  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=881) present sentence plasma advocating after  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=884) 11:00 it's Leah Angeles Valley you have  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=887) a kind of like a normal sentence and you  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=890) have a resonance and first three ahead  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=893) of so the first half are to live near  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=896) there are three now sentence except and  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=899) the last three are Jewish family they  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=902) are bouncing the one in the middle is I  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=906) do it may I be hovering apartment at  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=908) it's basically a normal sentence with a  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=911) with a heart which is rare to be the  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=914) news of the of the census which is put  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=918) in in yoga the place all of this mean  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=921) there will be net and it goes back to  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=924) you while surviving in the proper was  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=928) awesome time  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=929) who are those people who have been  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=931) joined up because never in the desire we  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=932) get lost  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=933) absolutely lots of Possible's of Angela  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=937) they said Jewish people and  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=943) 3:11 basically in terms of in the  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=946) Islamic theology is being that the  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=951) Jewish clergy of that type and this  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=954) trickle-down has a tendency to knowledge  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=957) not a job and not necessarily action so  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=963) there isn't any tracks prepare applying  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=966) all the number yeah and that you are as  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=969) narrated lightly and in general who are  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=973) Valley who are the ones who illustrate  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=976) so he replies the officiator while the  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=979) Cassini orbiter that but what they  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=980) believe in the Trinity and these  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=982) campaigns are completely irrational so  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=985) they haven't got any difficulty they  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=988) they they irrationally deplete on any  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=992) substantive knowledge okay it's a  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=994) basically here in the paralysis of  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=997) America John become almost emulsified  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=998) shut up to Merced River agree so we have  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1000) met may be of new ionization we're not  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1003) meant to be like all knowledge in no  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1006) action I will almost lure action in a  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1007) lot therefore come back to our sense of  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1011) the front the the structural completion  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1014) to look further being three murders  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1017) constructed of germanium and and some of  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1022) this may I means that there are normal  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1023) services and in our if you feed the  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1025) light basically it's very fishable for a  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1030) unholy percentage so they give you  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1032) knowledge and and other ones if you  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1035) haven't because it's verbal at first not  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1037) doing like that  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1038) and the one of the middle is kind of  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1039) like a combination book again

[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/ciQVUBMyVkY?t=1055) doing kind of verses and you go one
