# Apostasy Punishment in a Liberal State? (2019-01-28)

<iframe loading='lazy' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PnRGigvmVL8'></iframe>## Description

This is a spin on the usual question posed to Muslim traditionalists of what the punishment of apostasy is in an Islamic state. The question under investigation in this video is the extent to which social contract models (in liberal states) could allow punitive punishment for 'anti-state' expressions in a public domain. 

This is what John Locke had to say in his letter concerning tolerance: 

The case of idolaters, in respect of the Jewish commonwealth [i.e. the Kingdom of Ancient Israel], falls under a double consideration. The first is of those who, being initiated in the Mosaical rites, and made citizens of that commonwealth, did afterwards apostatise from the worship of the God of Israel. These were proceeded against as traitors and rebels, guilty of no less than high treason. For the commonwealth of the Jews, different in that from all others, was an absolute theocracy; nor was there, or could there be, any difference between that commonwealth and the Church [i.e. the Jewish religion]. The laws established there concerning the worship of One Invisible Deity were the civil laws of that people and a part of their political government, in which God Himself was the legislator. Now, if any one can shew me where there is a commonwealth at this time, constituted upon that foundation, I will acknowledge that the ecclesiastical laws do there unavoidably become a part of the civil, and that the subjects of that government both may and ought to be kept in strict conformity with that Church by the civil power.

Immanuel Kant says in the metaphysics of morals: 
A Law which is so holy and inviolable that it is practically a crime even to Cast doubt upon it, or to suspend its operation for a moment, is represented of itself as necessarily derived from some Supreme, unblameable Lawgiver. And this is the meaning of the maxim, ‘All Authority is from God ‘ which proposition does not express the historical foundation of the Civil Constitution, but an ideal Principle of the Practical Reason. It may be otherwise rendered thus, ‘It is a Duty to obey the Law of the existing Legislative Power, be its origin what it may.

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=0) - [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=1200)

discusses apostasy and how it would be punished in a liberal state. argues that, in a liberal state, apostasy would be seen as a breach of the social contract and would be punished accordingly. He also argues that human rights are not always respected in liberal states, and that there must be a balance between rights and responsibilities.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=0)** , a brother asks about the punishment for apostasy in Islam, and a more interesting question is posed: to what extent can liberalism or does liberalism talk about this topic? The argument goes that, as followers of a human, individuals have the right to free belief, and if someone changes their religion, they should be free to do so. Liberals in philosophy generally agree with this position, but there is still the issue of punishment for apostasy. The brother claims that, even though belief is something that is personal and between oneself and God, it is only known through public proclamation. Thus, even though liberals may support freedom of belief, they still recognize the need for law and representation- in other words, social contract theory. This theory is, in theory, able to facilitate punitive punishment for those who renounce their faith publicly.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=300)** , Jay Mill discusses liberalism and apostasy punishment. He argues that in a liberal state, apostasy would be seen as a breach of the social contract and would be punished accordingly. John Locke, a prominent figure in liberalism, wrote about tolerance for Jewish states and mentions apostasy in chapter 19 of his book, On Tolerance. Jay argues that apostasy would be permissible in a liberal state, as long as it is done in accordance with the social contract. John Stuart Mill, another prominent figure in liberalism, wrote about blasphemy law in a manuscript attributed to him. He says that if someone kills someone because of their religious beliefs, they should be killed.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=600)** In a liberal state, personal beliefs can differ from what is expressed publicly, and this can lead to a rupture of the social contract. It is possible for liberalism to slip into a intolerant state, where certain beliefs are not allowed. Liberals debate the extent to which individual rights should take precedence over social contract theory. John Stuart Mill says that certain acts, such as sex in public, should not be accessible to the public without fear of reprisal.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=900)** , a liberal speaker argues that apostasy law, or the punishment of death for those who abandon their faith, is necessary in a Western liberal state. He goes on to say that the Western man is more liberal, and therefore apostates should be punished more harshly than those in other cultures. He also argues that human rights are not always respected in liberal states, and that there must be a balance between rights and responsibilities.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRGigvmVL8&t=1200)**  an apostate is punished in a liberal state, and it is argued that this punishment has no basis in morality or ethics. Instead, it is simply a value judgment of 21st century complexity.

[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=4) so the brother asked the question about  
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=6) apostasy yeah so the punishment for  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=13) apostasy in Islam so I think a lot of  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=16) time we ask this question what is the  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=19) punishment for apostasy in Islam and a  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=23) more interesting question for me  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=25) recently has been to what extent can  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=29) liberalism or does liberalism or do  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=32) liberal philosophers talk about this  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=37) because that's like that's for me a  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=39) really interesting discussion in it the  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=41) argument goes as followers right you say  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=43) that look everyone should have freedom  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=47) of belief it's a human it's an  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=48) individual human right and therefore if  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=52) someone changes their religion they  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=54) should be free to do so based on human  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=57) rights and based on the fact that they  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=59) should have freedom of consciousness and  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=61) so the argument is not a bad one because  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=64) actually coincides with the Islamic  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=66) understanding of free will and actually  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=69) it coincides with the version of Quran  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=71) which says like Rajas with Dean tucked  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=73) away in a rush to Delhi in chapter 2  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=76) verse 256 of the Quran which there is no  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=78) compulsion of religion that truth has  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=81) been made clear from falsehood so the  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=84) the idea that there should be freedom of  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=86) consciousness and freedom of belief is  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=89) actually a principle part of the Islamic  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=92) discourse because we believe that there  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=94) are two things that's here which is free  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=97) will and there's determinism over  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=99) Lazcano Taliban he writes things etc so  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=102) we believe everyone does have a right to  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=104) believe in whatever they want to believe  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=105) and the idea is not one-off and this  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=111) should be very much stressed in Islamic  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=113) discourse it's not one of individual  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=116) belief  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=118) this is to do with social contracts okay  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=121) now this is a big term in political  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=124) science what do you mean by the term  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=125) social contract now in liberal  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=128) philosophy there are two things right  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=130) there's the primacy of individual and  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=133) their right to do whatever they want  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=135) without intervention from the government  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=137) and on the other hand you have the  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=139) universality of law you're stuck between  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=143) two things as a liberal you have the  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=147) primacy of being an individual you're an  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=149) individual right you have the freedom to  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=150) do everyone and for a liberal expression  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=152) a libertarian they'll say you should the  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=154) government should keep away from putting  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=156) obstacles in the way of the individual  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=158) so that it can be as free as possible  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=160) right but then obviously they realize  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=163) almost all liberal theorists realize the  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=166) need for number one representation and  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=168) number two law which is why they have  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=171) social contract now what is social  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=174) contract social contract is number one  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=177) is forced upon us so by virtue of the  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=181) fact that I'm a British citizen you're  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=182) British isn't as well your British is  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=184) now we're gonna have to check on that  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=186) okay by virtue of the fact that we're  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=192) British citizens we have to abide by  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=194) British law and that's not something we  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=196) have any say on because of the  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=199) citizenship that we carry in other words  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=200) we're forced into a social contract it's  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=203) not a social contract which is a  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=205) voluntary or something I have any choice  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=208) in write the terms of that social  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=211) contract indicate that I have to follow  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=213) the law of this country isn't it okay so  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=216) almost all liberal theorists agreed with  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=218) this now the question is not one of  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=221) personal belief I can believe whatever I  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=223) want to believe from a liberal  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=225) perspective and from an Islamic  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=226) perspective and not not have any  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=229) punishment in any context exerted on me  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=231) in any way because belief is something  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=234) which is personal belief is something  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=236) which is between me and God and it's  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=239) only known through the publication of  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=242) that belief or profession of that belief  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=244) in public settings right so in other  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=246) words people won't know I believe unless  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=248) I don't declare it  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=250) question to what extent are what are  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=256) referred to as laws of apostasy which is  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=261) for example if I come out and say I'm no  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=263) longer say for instance a Christian I'm  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=265) not going to use the Muslim example say  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=266) it's a Christian country and I come out  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=269) and say I'm no longer a Christian to  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=273) what extent can social contract theory  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=276) the lack of which were which was  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=278) advocated by people like Rousseau and  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=279) obviously John Locke before him Thomas  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=282) Hobbes and almost all liberal theorists  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=285) even Jay s mill can it facilitate for a  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=289) kind of punitive punishment for those  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=292) who renounce their faith publicly now  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=295) I'm gonna make a very bold claim here  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=297) I'm putting a slam to the side right now  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=299) I'm putting a sum to the side it's not  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=301) about Islam I'm gonna say that from my  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=305) reading of liberalism that that can be  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=308) facilitated what am I talking about I am  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=311) saying quite clearly that if someone  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=314) comes in a liberal state which also  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=317) claims to be for instance Christian  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=320) which can happen according to Jay's mill  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=323) that number one point one that in that  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=326) liberal state it would be it could be  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=330) seen as a rupturing of the social  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=332) contract if someone professes publicly  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=336) yes that they are not X faith anymore  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=340) that is if that faith is connected with  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=343) the social contract  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=344) why is your evidence for this I will  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=346) give you the evidence for this right now  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=347) John Locke wrote a book obviously  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=350) everyone knows it called the two  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=351) treatises of government I think he wrote  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=353) this in 1687 when he also wrote I wrote  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=356) a book called on tolerance in chapter 19  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=359) of this book in chapter 19 of this book  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=362) on tolerance he talks about Jewish  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=366) States John Locke talks about Jewish  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=369) states and up if it's not chapter 19 is  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=372) somewhere in the book and he says it's  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=374) legitimate to allow Jewish people to  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=378) implement Mosaic law and we know full  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=381) well that in Mosaic law there are laws  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=383) of apostasy and he continues by talking  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=387) about the social exclusion of a certain  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=389) amount of certain people of different  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=392) faith groups he talks about Mohammedans  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=393) and atheists now Muslims wouldn't say  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=397) this by the way so in essence you could  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=400) argue that Islam applies a more rigorous  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=404) type of liberalism than John Locke  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=406) himself why because Islam says in us in  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=409) an Islamic state or some a governance if  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=412) you're a Muslim or a Christian or a Jew  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=414) you can live in your respective  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=417) province without harm now someone will  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=422) say but then they say that you have to  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=423) pay the jizya but according to the  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=426) hadith  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=428) jizya is one dinner so it's a tax it's a  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=433) tax that almost everyone has to pay for  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=434) the protection of the people one dinner  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=436) is less than there's a cat which is  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=438) usually typically 20 dinars of my Saab  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=442) so therefore the jizya is less so this  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=447) idea this false notion of GCR being a  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=449) discriminatory tax it's only  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=451) discriminatory against Muslims because  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=453) Muslims have to pay more by the way if  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=456) you want to call it discriminatory  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=458) Muslims actually have to pay more as a  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=459) cat's yeah so going back to I was saying  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=464) about apostasy I came across in my new  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=466) campus work and I also came across John  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=468) Stuart Mill's work and there was a  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=471) manuscript that was attributed to John  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=472) Stuart Mill which actually specifically  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=476) talks about blasphemy law and he talks  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=479) about blasphemy law and he says John  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=481) Stuart Mill says  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=485) Joshua mill actually says equivocally  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=488) that if killing someone this is John  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=494) Stuart Mill not the Prophet Muhammad not  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=496) Moses not Jesus it's not a medieval text  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=500) this is one of the prime figures of  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=502) liberalism in the Victorian era in  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=505) Britain by which and through which most  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=507) other subsequent theories take their  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=510) liberalism from he actually says in that  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=512) manuscript that killed them yes  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=515) he says kill them kill them if you have  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=518) to kill many of them kill them in other  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=519) words it seems to me an Immanuel Kant  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=521) has some similar sayings it seems to me  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=524) that the question we should be asking is  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=527) not whether Islam allows apostasy law  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=529) it's where the liberalism allows  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=531) apostasy law because actually when we  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=534) look at the primary source materials of  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=536) the most regarded liberal theorists the  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=540) highest founding fathers of liberalism  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=542) it would seem that a social contract  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=544) theory could in fact facilitate of a  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=548) kind of apostasy law right - that's from  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=552) a liberal perspective Aslam is something  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=555) quite similar in many ways but has some  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=558) fundamental differences  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=561) so relatable ooh a man who's one of the  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=565) prophets companions you had a list of  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=568) people who are munafa corn and those  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=571) list of people were people who had  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=573) rejected Islam there were not Muslims  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=575) the Quran says in Delhi would have  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=577) Athena Fidel kill s Philemon enough that  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=579) certainly the the hypocrites are in the  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=582) lowest part pit of the Hellfire they are  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=585) not Muslims they are not believers they  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=587) are not movements yes yet  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=591) there was no apostasy punishment applied  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=594) to those individuals there was no  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=596) apostasy pub thing applied to them why  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=599) because it regarded to personal belief  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=601) so I'll because I'll be unequivocal in  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=605) saying this that which regards to  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=607) personal belief is that is different  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=610) from that which is expressed publicly  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=612) and thereby from a liberal perspective  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=614) before even becomes an Islamic one  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=616) ruptures the social contract now the  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=619) question is is it fair and is it okay is  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=622) it possible is it conceivable in a  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=625) liberal state bearing in mind social  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=628) contract theory to have these laws and  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=631) therefore can liberalism can a liberal  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=634) state slip into a kind of nationalistic  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=637) stay intolerant state the answer is  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=640) unfortunately yes that is the elasticity  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=642) of liberalism liberalism because of the  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=645) tensions between the primacy of  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=646) individual versus the universality of  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=649) law could sway in either one of the two  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=652) directions could either become very much  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=655) libertarian in the sense that you know  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=657) we don't even allow I mean think about  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=658) this this way yeah libertarians would  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=661) argue why do we have seatbelt laws yeah  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=663) we have Seaborg known you have to go in  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=665) your car you have to put on a seatbelt  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=667) don't you but why do I have the policy  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=670) bro why is they a libertarian would  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=672) argue this is a paternalism they'll say  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=676) it's like the state is acting as your  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=678) parent now put under what it's not to  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=680) live even if I hurt myself it's none of  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=681) your business if I help myself someone  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=683) could argue a libertarian would  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=684) definitely argue but even if I hurt  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=686) myself in the car tonight I create a  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=687) crater crash it's not I'm not harming  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=689) anyone else by doing this why are you  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=690) telling me what to do so I'm allowed to  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=692) drink alcohol think  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=693) this because this is the this is the  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=695) ignorant of some people of their own  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=697) philosophy right I'm allowed to drink  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=699) alcohol yeah and in some places smoke  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=702) weed and have you know unlimited amount  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=705) of sexual partners polyandry and that  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=708) could cause problems for myself sexual  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=711) problems all of that is permissible but  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=713) I have to put on a seatbelt  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=714) I mean does that sound reasonable to you  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=716) seriously think about it I'm allowed to  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=718) compete in mixed martial arts well I  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=720) could injure someone and and die I can  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=724) go to a complainer I could be but I have  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=726) to put on the the seatbelt what kind of  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=728) nonsense is this  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=729) think about it it doesn't make any sense  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=731) let's be honest about this yeah why are  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=733) why is the state telling us you have to  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=735) put on the seat belt if I if I don't put  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=737) on the seat belt well I harm anyone else  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=738) think about it am I gonna harm any I'll  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=741) have myself yes but I'm not going to  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=744) harm anyone else by not putting my see  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=745) boy yeah boy if I hit the no no my point  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=750) is this my point is that liberal  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=753) philosophy can go in two different ways  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=755) yeah you have on the left side let's say  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=757) for the sake of argument and extreme  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=759) libertarianism where we don't want the  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=762) state to get involved in any matter yeah  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=764) like for example we shouldn't have  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=766) seatbelt laws that's one side on the  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=768) other side is where liberal philosophers  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=770) will say actually there should be  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=773) restriction and that should be enforced  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=775) through the context of social contract  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=778) theory into the universality of law  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=781) which should be applicable on the  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=782) individual laws should be applied and  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=784) John Stuart Mill's has something very  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=786) interesting you know he says he says for  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=788) instance he goes if a husband and wife  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=790) they have sex in public is that harming  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=793) anyone else you could argue no you could  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=795) argue no not physically harming anyone  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=797) if for example not to point anyone out  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=800) someone brings his wife and you know in  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=802) the park in the middle here sorry to say  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=804) has sexual it takes his trousers off  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=806) yeah and all of those things sorry to  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=808) say Annie is that going to harm anyone  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=810) no they're having sex you can decide to  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=812) leave you can go you don't have to look  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=814) at it you can't you don't need to be  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=816) offended by it what why is that censor  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=818) yes you could argue this yep now I  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=821) understand children and all that but we  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=823) can have an area where they can do it no  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=825) problem you can have an adult park why  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=827) not right Colin yeah I'm just I'm just  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=831) yeah I agree with you I agree with this  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=833) point I'm not telling you should I do  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=835) deal for us yes yes my friend I agree  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=838) with you yes but I'm saying  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=839) so John Stuart Mill said look there's  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=842) some things this is what he said there's  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=844) some things which keys our sensibilities  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=846) we have a culture and that's not  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=849) acceptable in our culture and he says  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=851) therefore the universality of law and  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=853) the social contract should put  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=855) restriction so here John Stuart Mill is  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=858) talking about in on Liberty in his book  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=860) he's saying that there are certain  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=861) things which should not be accessible  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=863) for people  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=864) ie having sex with your wife in public  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=866) spheres or your husband yes so the  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=869) question is now is Israel question what  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=871) should be allowed to be done in publicly  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=873) without fear of reprisal or other or  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=876) otherwise a fear of a consequence from  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=879) the law this is a thing that liberals  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=881) struggle with that's why you have  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=882) different schools of thought within  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=883) liberalism and I've something about  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=884) elasticity of liberalism yeah it's not  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=887) something which all can be liberal now  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=888) now the question is when they come to us  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=890) this is what I'm going to say to  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=891) everyone to answer your question sorry  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=892) yeah when they come to us and say look  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=894) you need to modernize what did I say you

[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=908) talking about you know I'm talking yeah  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=910) yeah the Western man what do you mean  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=912) what do you mean by it all right I tell  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=914) you what you mean  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=915) you mean become more liberal because  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=917) that is the dominant ethnic in the  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=919) Western world yes  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=920) okay now I'm liberal I have embraced  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=923) liberalism brother today I mean okay  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=926) what do we do let's go look at the  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=927) liberal books  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=929) let's look at the works of John Locke  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=931) and John Stuart Mill and Rousseau bottom  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=937) I'm not an ambassador for Saudi Arabia  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=940) yes I agree with you all I I don't yeah  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=944) yeah I agree with this point yeah I do  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=945) it that way yeah yeah sorry come back  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=948) I'm a liberal now yeah so yes I've  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=951) embraced liberalism let's go to the  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=953) books of the Liberals so we find within  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=955) the books of the Liberals you haven't  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=957) you have a spectrum of understanding of  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=960) to what the question the main question  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=962) is to what extent should the government  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=964) intervene and you don't have one answer  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=967) for that you have ten answers from ten  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=969) different liberal thinkers yes and so  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=972) here's what I'm saying to you is that  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=973) going back to apostasy law yeah gone  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=977) back to apostasy look I'll come to our  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=979) speaker after cuz I can yes I agree I  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=982) agree with you brother yes yes yes you  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=985) have to have rules yes that's that's my  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=987) that's my argument I agree with you yes  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=989) I do with you  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=990) yeah the man made a good point there you  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=992) must have rules otherwise people who  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=993) behaves anarchy he's right but the  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=996) question is just yeah think about it  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=999) think have you ever thought about this  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1001) before  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1001) they talk about human rights so to watch  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1006) that kind of liberal state institutional  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1008) institutionalize the law universalize it  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1011) and apply a death penalty for those who  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1014) don't go against it  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1016) well according to John Locke according  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1018) to John Stuart Mill according to your  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1019) manual can according to John Russo Russo  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1022) according to most even Voltaire I  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1024) believe as well  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1025) according to almost every liberal they  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1027) have full right to do that because of  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1029) the social contract therefore don't tell  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1031) me about liberalism I mean that's what  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1032) that's the issue here they come with a  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1034) false pretense they're even know their  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1035) own philosophy that's the issue they  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1037) don't even know their own philosophy  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1039) that's why America gets away with panel  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1042) of death penalties they have a death  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1044) penalty in America it's not against  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1046) liberalism to have a death penalty it's  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1048) not against it  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1049) yes sir yes sir yes sir that's a  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1056) political question if you're asking  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1057) about Parliament obviously going back to  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1059) charles ii and his but we don't want to  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1061) go in this country there's a whole  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1063) there's a whole tradition and if you  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1064) want to go back to william ii will name  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1065) the first William the Conqueror in 1066  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1067) I don't know how far back you want to  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1069) take this we can talk after I say it's a  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1071) long when I go and go Vesely we should I  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1075) go back to the room but at newman's I  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1077) don't know I don't know  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1078) so here ladies and gentlemen don't be  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1081) deceived as my as my is my point when  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1084) you ask her and this is the  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1085) presupposition which we have to  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1087) investigate because when they say human  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1089) rights what do they what do they  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1091) actually mean they mean 1948 convention  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1094) of human rights that was put in place  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1095) after World War two that's what they  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1097) that's what they mean right all right so  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1100) that convention if you read it it's got  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1102) 30 articles  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1103) it's got 30 different points 30  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1106) different points in everyone in those 30  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1108) different points you have the right of  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1110) this the right of that the right of this  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1112) right now  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1125) here's my criticism of the whole thing  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1128) I've got a criticism of the whole I've  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1129) got a criticism of the whole thing I've  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1131) got criticism you know when you tell  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1134) someone you've got a right to do  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1135) something if I tell you brother you have  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1137) the right to do this you know you know  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1139) what is telling you to do to be entitled  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1141) that's what it's telling you to be right  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1143) so it's it's a negative way of asserting  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1146) something it's a look you have this  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1147) right it means you are entitled to this  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1149) the question is why does this why does  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1152) the UN Declaration of Human Rights 1948  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1154) not have anything on responsibilities  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1157) because by telling you how to write is  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1159) telling you what you deserve but it's  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1161) not telling you what you need to do and  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1163) that's the problem with a lot of the  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1166) rights culture that we have any moment  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1167) you have the right to this yeah the  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1169) right slap you have the children a child  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1170) has a right to education but a teacher  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1172) does not have a right to a  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1173) responsibility to teach how does that  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1175) even work  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1176) you need to counterbalance rights with  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1179) responsibilities that's that is a  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1180) communitarian criticism which has been  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1183) made of liberal human rights culture  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1186) look I want to wrap up by saying yes I  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1189) want to wrap up by saying in the in the  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1191) context of the West we don't believe in  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1193) if someone changes their religion yes  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1195) whatever it is well hi you're there we  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1198) don't care if they're Muslim we don't we  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1200) don't look good even in the context  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1201) although Islamic state we don't care  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1204) about personal beliefs the extent to  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1206) which we care about personal beliefs is  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1208) the extent to which it's connected with  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1210) concepts of rupturing a pre-existing  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1213) social contract which is put in place  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1216) with the permission yes of that  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1218) individual because they have to obey act  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1220) they have to pledge allegiance they have  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1222) to give legitimate is a legitimacy of  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1224) that state  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1225) so in some I would say the laws the  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1229) punitive laws of Islam and this is my  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1231) final statement my final statement every  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1234) single punitive law in Islam the death  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1238) penalty is what they call the rid the  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1241) punishment every single one of them can  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1244) be justified not Islamic lean through  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1246) liberalism and through the social  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1248) contract  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1249) yes we would be going away from  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1251) libertarianism but you can justify it  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1253) through the universality of law so it's  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1255) not even a liberal critique of Islam if  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1258) we're honest with ourselves and  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1260) therefore it has no moral or ethical  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1262) basis it's just a subjective Mally a  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1265) value judgment of 21st century  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1267) complexity  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/PnRGigvmVL8?t=1269) Duprey
