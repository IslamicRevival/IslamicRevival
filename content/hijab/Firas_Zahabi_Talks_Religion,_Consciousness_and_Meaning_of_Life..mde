[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=137) with not much of an education he was a  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=140) mechanic he really grew up in the

[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=144) that time you didn't really go to school  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=145) for long of course there was a civil war  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=147) in Lebanon so they the they were  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=150) refugees to Canada etc yeah well my  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=154) introduction is not the first time I  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=155) heard about Islam was my father preached  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=157) that I come to preach to his kids to  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=158) teach them that Dean we should have a  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=160) religion yeah and I remember those  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=162) lessons really well quite well and they  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=165) served me my entire life and I would say  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=167) gave me even an edge in life because all  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=170) my peers were not Muslim the 99%  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=173) Christian or Jewish and and a lot of  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=177) seculars secular families and kids etc  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=181) and there was what there was some  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=183) lessons that really myself helped me out  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=185) through life and gave me a strong edge  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=187) because I found like especially in the  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=188) West people struggle very emotionally  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=190) they're very emotionally involved and  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=193) they have their ups and downs  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=194) emotionally but my emotions were always  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=196) very in check and it was one one thing  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=200) that he told me that I think if I feel  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=202) calm if a regular person were to hear it  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=204) they were taken at heart that would be  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=205) shocked and he was like he told me ask  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=207) me who do you love more your mother or  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=209) your God Oh is maybe eight or nine maybe

[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=217) young kids and my mother  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=218) well I didn't think much about the odd  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=220) or whatnot and he said to me no he said  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=222) think about it we questioned me very  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=224) gently very nicely said who gave you  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=226) your mother who gave you everything you

[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=229) thank you guys  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=230) I need something look maybe one day your  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=232) mother she gets sick and dies and you're  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=235) alone you can't base your life on one  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=237) person you can't be selected on money or  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=241) fame or fortune because all these things  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=243) can be gone it can be taken off from  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=244) underneath you  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=245) and told me you always have to depend on  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=248) God firstly for us above all and this  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=252) gave me a very very strong mental  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=256) grounding yeah because anything that  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=258) happened to me in life anything about it  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=260) happened to me in life in your season  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=261) someone there's nothing that's gonna  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=263) come your way and I have God never sent  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=266) to an officer going yes  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=268) you cannot hand that home so when  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=270) something would come my way I'd be  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=271) nervous I'd be scared and it gave me a  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=274) strong courage and it made me very very  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=278) know how to say but maybe very good with  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=281) the relationships because I would never  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=284) try to behave in a way to make you like  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=288) me because I was never on my I was never  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=291) like a suck up to people yeah because I  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=293) would never see somebody else mean  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=295) everybody was there was God and then  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=298) there was everybody else so you never I  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=300) never put people up on a pedestal so to  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=302) speak I think that helped me  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=304) tremendously because when I would see my  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=306) competitors or I would see somebody  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=307) intimidating obstacle I would as always  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=310) remind myself don't look at them so hot  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=314) in so many big moments in sports  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=316) terrible  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=317) now as for myself this is nothing but  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=319) big of a deal  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=322) and always lowered things are used to  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=324) create intimidation resonate for a lot  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=334) of people by early 90s and obviously a  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=336) lot people in the West don't believe in  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=339) business how would you reason to say it  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=343) atheist or someone else doesn't believe  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=345) in God the existence of God would you  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=348) say well you see there are three ways of  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=351) knowing something primarily let's just  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=353) keep it really basic ok this  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=354) philosophies it's a notion the primary  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=358) way you can have something to your  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=359) senses where you touch smell taste we're  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=362) here empiricism then we have deduction  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=365) mathematics one two three four  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=368) things are in order one plus one equals  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=370) two yeah I think we have a third a third  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=372) way of knowing something it's called  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=373) intuition  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=375) now intuition nobody can debate your  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=379) intuition so you can tell me the  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=383) temperature of that team we can measure  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=385) it its objective we can tell you the  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=389) number of people on the ship confident  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=391) about it however the tastes of the team  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=394) or what it's like to be you is all  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=396) intuitive and you have something to us  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=400) we call consciousness we are self-aware  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=403) this self-awareness is something  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=407) metaphysical it is beyond physics we  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=409) cannot put it in a test there's a part  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=411) of us we could not put in a test so it  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=413) reminds me of a little example I like to  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=417) give a little question like basketball  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=419) because you know I often often try to  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=422) teach people about self-reflection and  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=425) consciousness and in today the the West  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=427) so dominated by materialism yeah it  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=430) seems to be that for those who don't  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=432) know what is it what is materialism  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=434) that's such a great question that's why  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=435) this little anecdote is something that I  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=437) think really helps people learn the  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=440) difference between the great questions  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=444) on substance philosophy so basic  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=446) question your basic basic thought  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=448) experiment  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=449) I'm building a robot yeah okay and we  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=451) talked about this video for the audience  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=464) for spotting I take some of his lines  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=477) yes I like tell people okay let's say  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=479) we're building a robot trying to learn  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=481) that deep philosophical question and  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=484) trying to learn it through a fun  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=485) experience more easy than the  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=486) long-winded explanation yeah we're  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=488) building a robot okay so the robot  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=490) instead of skinny has sheet metal  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=492) instead of bones yes steel steel steel  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=495) bones instead of blood he has oil  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=498) instead of a heart he has a pump instead  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=501) of an eye he has a camera instead of  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=503) this he has everything is machine he  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=507) talks like you acts like he has a  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=508) program we programmed him to talk like  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=511) you  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=511) we programmed him to think like you to  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=513) learn like you he has your IQ if I pinch  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=515) it he says ow  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=516) if I tell him a joke he laughs but I  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=519) programmed him to do this  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=521) then one he's exactly like me the only  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=524) thing we know the difference between you  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=525) and him is he's made of steel when we  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=527) touch him your flesh and bone he's still  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=529) and then one day I come and I destroy  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=533) this comedy jack 2.0  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=535) now the question AB there's no wrong  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=538) answer right now it's not see we're not  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=539) trying to see a right or wrong answer  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=540) I'm asking then I commit murder or did I  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=543) destroy a property I destroy a property  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=546) yeah so somebody who says I committed a  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=549) murder he would say look I'm a  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=551) materialist meaning the only thing that  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=553) exists and there are people many people  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=555) are there who are materialist they  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=557) believe that the only thing that exists  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=559) is a material substance they would say  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=561) look that how much each app 2.0 is  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=563) exactly like he should have his rights  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=565) like you he's 100% and human because  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=570) there's nothing more to you than  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=572) substance material material substance  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=575) now the people who say no no you just  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=577) damage property we gotta ask them okay  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=580) what was missing what was the difference  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=583) what's the difference  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=585) Perry's not too bad what is the answer  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=588) to that question  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=590) then they're going to the primal  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=592) consciousness there's a problem of  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=594) course how do you know consciousness do  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=596) you know it deductively mathematics or  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=598) do you not in pearson empirically  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=599) through your senses but either we know  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=603) it intuitively now because we know  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=607) something intuitively that shows us that  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=610) science is not absolute I love science I  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=612) could sit here great science for one  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=614) hour if you like but I'm gonna save you  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=616) one out I can't take my word for it I'm  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=618) intrigued by science I'll read up on  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=621) science I believe in science I think  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=623) it's one way to know something yeah  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=625) however does it tell me the truth with a  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=627) capital T as I like to say man not true  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=629) everyday too comfortable to it yeah  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=631) where I can have to leave me here yeah  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=633) no I'm talking about the true  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=635) philosophers interested in the truth  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=637) that capital P yeah that's I can't  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=640) science gave me in the capital T true  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=642) the answer is no because it couldn't  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=647) tell me even about my own consciousness  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=649) so like this one of the great thinkers  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=651) that I'm very passionately well he said  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=654) look think about it this way if I were  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=656) really tiny thought experiment and I was  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=659) walking around in your brain I would see  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=662) neurons firing I would see blood flowing  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=664) I would see a brain a physical brain I  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=666) would see all sorts of things but I  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=667) wouldn't see life I wouldn't see your  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=670) thoughts you know what if you're the  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=672) song you're playing you and your head  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=674) that you're saying that you hear in your  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=675) mind I want to hear it all I would see  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=677) was the information yeah now this  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=679) information is being transformed  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=680) somewhere somehow through an experience  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=683) but this experience is outside the test  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=686) tube as I like so I can't put it in the  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=688) testing it's what we call in philosophy  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=690) metaphysical  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=691) it is not physical so if I'm gonna adopt  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=695) a dogmatic scientific method  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=698) meaningless science or nothing I'm  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=701) denying the thing that makes me most  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=703) unit the thing that's in my face 24  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=707) hours a day that cannot divide and you  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=709) know this is a lot of philosophy in a  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=712) few minutes you know we have the capito  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=713) I think therefore I am which proves  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=715) intuition is above all first it's the  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=718) first thing that you know it's actually  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=719) the only thing that we know now we were  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=723) talking earlier today what is the  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=724) difference between believing something  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=726) and knowing something for those who  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=727) don't know some beautiful  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=729) Carlito's something that they card said  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=731) that many people misunderstand I said  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=732) look I think therefore I have people  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=735) that worry you got finally figured out  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=736) if he exists hahahaha  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=739) it's not that he figured out he exists  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=741) he knew that before when he figured out  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=744) is that I now know something I don't  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=748) believe something because everything is  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=749) bullied save people to that point he  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=754) said look let me cross examine  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=756) everything I believe and he found out  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=759) that everything he believed he could  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=760) down his dog was so extreme we call it  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=764) Cartesian doubt modern philosophy most  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=768) philosophers will agree most scholars  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=769) will agree it started with bacon because  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=772) he did something so different that the  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=774) Greeks didn't do it was always said he's  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=780) quite a copy of God  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=782) again I just started to touch I said  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=785) it's work and when I read out so amazed  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=787) how similar or less you go they catch  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=789) word and it comes over a hundred years  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=791) before yeah it's incredible how the  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=797) Islamic philosophers were so fascinating  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=799) and you know at the senior touches on a  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=802) very interesting experiment it calls at  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=804) the floating man experiments a muslim  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=806) phosphorus caller said look imagine you  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=808) are floating man i'm still looking in  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=813) today  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=816) the floating man experiment says ok  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=818) imagine we take away your pinky where  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=821) you here take away your face you're  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=823) floating in the air ok we take away that  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=825) dunya everything's gone you take away  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=826) one thing out a final you're just  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=828) floating even we take away your seat  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=831) your spatial orientation is there still  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=835) something an answer if you think about  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=837) it yes there's a consciousness what do  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=840) you conscious of nothing really but you  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=842) still there's a consciousness and he  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=845) says you see he took it a different  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=846) trajectory but he found something that  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=849) you cannot put in a test that's beyond  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=852) yet it's beyond physical problems you  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=855) know see dick are assuming that  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=857) Aristotle  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=860) he made a lot of Socrates's lessons very  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=863) easy to understand so Socrates would  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=866) tell you okay look at this knife see  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=869) this knife if I show you a knife in  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=872) metal and I show you a knife in plastic  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=874) and I'll show you a knife made of wood  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=876) and then I show you a drawing of a knife  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=879) you're gonna tell me that's the nine  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=880) dots and I've got some they're all lives  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=882) and you're gonna tell me they're all  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=885) knives because they all have something  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=886) in common  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=887) this thing they have in common we call  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=891) it the essence so this table has the  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=895) same property as all other tables in the  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=898) history of the world every one of me did  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=900) they all shared in something we call  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=902) table miss the essence if you change the  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=905) essence you change the thing it's a  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=908) fight thickness table and I make it make  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=909) to check out of this unit likes no  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=911) longer a table it's not too thick I  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=913) changed the essence yeah so comedy job  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=917) after the age of seven every single cell  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=920) in his body has been changed according  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=922) to modern eyes  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=924) every single cell in your body is done  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=927) properly place it's been replaced by a  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=930) new material now how can we say you're  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=934) the same comedy chat we do say this is  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=938) known as the fellowship of thesis so  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=940) thesis was a Greek ship the ship had 99  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=944) parts every month one part was changed  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=948) put in the garage somewhere as the part  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=951) would get old  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=952) so after ninety nine months a paraphrase  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=956) the ship was brand new parts so the ship  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=960) of thesis we're still riding on it seem  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=962) license people see it that's a sister  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=965) ship  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=966) what were you today I was on this is  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=967) your ship we refer to this thesis is  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=969) ship but then we take all the old parts  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=972) we've been putting in the garage and we  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=973) reassemble them which one is thesis is  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=977) ship this is the ship it's not out there  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=982) in the world in here so we're getting a  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=985) deep philosophy we're talking about  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=987) ideal as it may be it's too much of a  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=988) topic for today yeah but the idea is  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=990) there are things that are known by the  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=992) mind so Socrates class stood in two  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=995) categories you have things that are  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=997) known by the senses the dunya the world  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1000) that's all this all this glass thousand  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1005) years from now is my gonna be I know  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1007) what VR the senses it belongs to a  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1009) category of things and is also very the  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1011) Buddhist religion Islamic religion in  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1013) Socratic thought we cross with the  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1016) Sailor this thing is going to dissolve  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1018) it's a category of things that dissolve  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1020) the things known by the mind never  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1024) dissolve it is the number one ever get  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1027) dissolve never how do we know Mohammed  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1030) Isha you know him by the mind his body  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1032) will dissolve his body's already been  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1034) changed several times in the flame  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1036) however how we know how much occasion is  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1039) through the mind and this is what we  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1041) call the soul this is one way we know  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1045) the soul the soul is long via the mind  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1046) so sorry said a soulless class of things  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1050) like Halloween oh god oh god the other  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1051) might know God via intuition not  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1054) mathematics or empiricism I should rule  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1057) the fifth law which is what we caught  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1059) that's why I'm studying today earlier I  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1061) studied philosophy for so many years  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1063) before I raced delved into Islam I only  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1065) been really studying is not for  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1066) seventeen years which is not a long time  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1068) people know as long it's not even close  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1070) to one percent how much there is to know  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1072) but I realized that all the lessons I  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1074) learned on Western philosophy and in  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1076) Buddhist or and all and all the great  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1077) thinkers know very fascinated I guess  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1080) it's all at Islam in a very deep and  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1085) profound level that I think would be to  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1088) one and  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1089) and drawn out for one village I guess a  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1092) but one thing we know it's the soul but  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1096) we know it directly it's actually you  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1099) know the soul more than you know this  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1101) table or physical world about the soul  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1104) is more immediate it's not intuitively  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1105) are you saying that now we have a  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1107) first-person subjective experience and  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1109) as much as that first-person subjective  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1112) experience direct substitutions are all  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1114) existence the reality round were also  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1117) the existence of a higher metaphysical  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1119) force which brought rise to all Nexus  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1122) now tell me the story of Adam please  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1125) police enough what happened in a  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1130) nutshell your tradition goes okay he  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1134) created Adam from the other one he did  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1138) some material substance material such  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1140) when he did so he breathed so now what  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1144) you did so in doing this sauce say they  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1155) ask you about the soul saying that the  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1158) soul is from the man I know you won't  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1163) know much about it so in other words  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1165) frankly for from our perspective not  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1169) much to be given some information well  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1171) we know this like expensive once again  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1173) is that number one the soul is something  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1175) which I must  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1176) Oh God Almighty implantable in salt  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1180) added with making viable through it and  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1184) afterwards all of human beings had the  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1187) same feature because the hadith is a  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1190) hadith in our tradition of which very  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1192) well-known it's like in the song anyway  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1194) today says that the human being is  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1197) created 40 days as long  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1201) in one formula for deserts why's that  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1203) and they said at the end of it then the  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1206) Angels breathes it to the universal so  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1209) the soul is a feature of everything  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1211) would be that can ask you a question are  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1212) we made of one soul of many ways we ever  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1215) even being has one soul but are we made  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1218) up once or is it is there is it as it  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1220) doesn't make any comment on if we're  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1222) made by one soul original soul what that  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1226) each human being has we share in the  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1229) same soul or is it individual soul every  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1233) individual has a specific souls out  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1235) there but this is the metaphysical  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1237) property so we have a story in the Quran  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1239) that says look there's this material  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1241) substance okay we can test it  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1242) scientifically but then there's an  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1243) ingredient we don't know much about yeah  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1246) but this ingredient you experience it  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1249) directly yes as a matter of fact it  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1251) flies in your face of science when you  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1254) ask a materialist philosopher who  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1256) science has mattress to clear some  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1258) positions so we'll about it that's all  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1260) we ask  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1261) a NASA scientist yeah how come I'm  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1263) conscious that's what we don't know  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1264) mystery they will never know we have a  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1270) verse we have a paradox about the  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1272) Chinese room sorry I thought experience  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1274) not a fair enough it's called the  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1276) Chinese room okay so the Chinese room is  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1278) you're in a room and I'm outside the  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1280) room and i slided a Chinese character  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1282) the Chinese character says hello and I  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1286) slide it in the room and you slide back  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1288) to me hello do you do and I slide you an  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1291) old saying how are you and you read  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1293) slide me back very good and you and  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1295) we're having this Chinese conversation  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1297) and then I open the door and I see you  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1301) said you speak Chinese you're like nah  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1303) don't speak Chinese  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1304) but we're having a conversation said  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1306) every time you slide me a character I  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1308) look in the book this character when you  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1311) get it send off this response  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1314) this is how a robot works the robot  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1318) doesn't understand the essence of words  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1321) he's just following an algorithm they  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1325) can get so sophisticated that they give  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1326) you the impression that they're human  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1328) yeah like one time the site is were  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1333) trying to mock Descartes and they made a  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1335) computer type I think therefore you  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1339) would print that out I'm sorry to say  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1342) look even the computer thinks it's  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1343) conscious but it's not and they were  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1344) putting butter at take up but really  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1348) what they were doing it was their  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1349) product they have contracts because that  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1352) is just an extension of you if you  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1353) really think about it somebody has to  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1355) have consciousness to say I think  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1356) therefore I am  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1357) long story short is people when you see  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1362) a robot a very sophisticated robot  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1364) people think on one day they'll have  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1365) consciousness you know they'll give  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1368) their parents the appearance of  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1369) consciousness they'll be very  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1370) sophisticated talking but we saw that  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1372) the Mohammed a job robot that we're  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1374) building  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1374) it's a destruction of property if you  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1379) ever see the movie castaway Tom Hanks  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1390) Wilson Wilson Wilson have a mind but he  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1398) projected his own mind onto Wilson one  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1401) day we're gonna have robots now we're  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1403) gonna protect our own mind that you can  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1405) project your money some people talk to  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1407) their imaginary friend the mind can be  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1412) projected it could do so many mess and  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1415) that's a situation the info  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1416) or for a robot right people are gonna be  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1419) like oh no robots cannot consciousness  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1421) one day no you cannot think about the  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1423) Pinocchio story I want to be a real boy  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1426) I wonder what how did they make him a  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1427) real boy you have to bring in some kind  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1430) of metaphysical element we're living  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1435) proof of metaphysics we're living proof  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1437) of me I don't need Richard Dawkins to  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1440) tell me if I'm going to live again or  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1441) what not that I know the part of me  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1444) belongs to the class of the mind it's  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1446) only known by the mind mathematics will  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1449) never get old and rust and died the  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1451) things known by the mind are never are  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1454) not subject to corrosion so to speak and  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1459) I really always loved the profound  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1461) question that asks you know I have again  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1464) micronus very weakly I know that there's  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1466) a part where they ask yes you know what  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1469) will be resurrected what brought you  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1470) here the first time see Socrates has a  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1474) very interesting dialogue he has in it  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1476) the fatal says look if you grew taller  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1480) you were first shorter you can't grow  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1483) taller if you were not first shorter  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1485) than possible they generate one another  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1488) so if I fell asleep first I was awake  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1491) and if I wake up first I was asleep and  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1494) you can do this with all the opposites  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1497) if I was cold first I was warming  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1499) I became warm brown for some sport  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1500) there's no escape they're tied together  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1504) voila he can examine it for thousands of  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1506) years then they have the greatest minds  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1508) have example and we cannot say that one  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1510) doesn't generate the other when was your  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1513) birthday okay where were you a year  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1516) before the fish is overthrown  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1518) you were not living oh yeah you were not  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1521) alive  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1521) you came to life yeah what does a time  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1524) and moment and space whatever the date  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1525) was exactly  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1526) you came to life what were you before  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1528) you came to life Socrates would tell you  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1532) and I would tell I would agree  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1533) some people have an emotional attachment  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1535) to answer this question the truth is you  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1537) were not living you are dead but you  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1539) came to life already happened  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1541) and if you were to go with the  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1545) scientific method today science would  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1546) tell you you're never gonna come to life  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1548) if you find you signs before I came to  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1550) life the times of it's impossible the  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1551) world you're talking about  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1552) is impossible if this world is possible  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1555) if this was a contingent remember we're  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1557) talking about like this this world is a  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1559) contingent meaning it could have been  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1561) another way if this world exists it's  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1564) very possible there are other worlds  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1565) that exists why not what's what is if  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1570) you understand cause and effect you  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1573) would know that if this world is  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1574) possible and the world is possible as a  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1576) matter of fact if you follow  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1578) regeneration but what Socrates says it  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1580) says look if everything went from life  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1582) to death and never reciprocated again  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1585) everything would be dead by now  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1588) everything would be dead if time is  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1591) infinite the cycle would have been done  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1594) if it was a one-time thing this is  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1597) complicated thinking it is it's very  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1599) advanced abduction very bad but the  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1601) truth no matter is like while learning  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1603) these things I really found them are  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1604) often the Quran in abundance and it's  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1608) fascinating that's really interesting  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1611) information and I think it's one of the  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1614) things that we don't stress enough with  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1616) the consciousness the consciousness is a  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1619) very unique argument it does require  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1620) your brain juices like hard thinking  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1624) you fool yeah but it's definitely  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1627) something that's good to put out there  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1629) we want to another issue now I just want  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1632) to kind of put our  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1633) some kind of thing social things  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1634) obviously we live in the West where  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1636) Muslims are all these things and we're  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1639) oftentimes fused okay well most of you  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1641) generally speaking why the right way I  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1643) will show how is it can I keep behind  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1645) the red door yes 30 minutes that's I  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1652) don't know how it is in Canada but here  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1655) in the UK accusations extremism and  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1669) these kind of things so have you found  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1671) that yourself and how how would you  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1673) advise Muslims to respond to that really  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1676) well I think the best thing is behave  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1679) well be a just person  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1681) yeah just person if you have information  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1683) share it if you don't know research it  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1685) and learn it the worst thing you can do  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1687) is talk about of ignorant surrender your  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1690) station but reading other so a good at  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1693) the and what's the slum about Islam is  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1695) about many central thin themes but one  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1697) central theme is justice yes  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1700) fairness me I rather suffer the  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1705) consequence that be on the face of it I  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1707) rather lose a hundred dollars and be  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1708) unfairly keep my to develop my because I  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1712) find justice to be beautiful and I find  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1714) that one of the central themes of Islam  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1715) is justice that's why I find Islam  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1718) beautiful even the Arabs at the time of  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1720) the Prophet SAW and Senate he funded  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1722) that the camel having rights was absurd  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1724) he was too progressive for them now  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1727) Islam for me I see it as a direction the  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1730) prophet saw the name suddenly took the  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1731) herbs one step at a time towards a  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1733) direction more and more lenient  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1735) more forgiving more and more tolerant  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1737) more and more loving more and more  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1739) caring and we have to continue this  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1741) trend today if the Prophet Solomon son  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1743) was alive today he would be the most  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1745) merciful the most renowned the most kind  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1747) the most generous I believe that because  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1749) George Bernard Shaw after reading the  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1751) CETA he said if this man was alive today  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1753) he would solve many of the world's  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1755) problems because what we're talking  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1756) earlier today about William definitely  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1758) definitely a German philosopher he says  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1760) look we're all made of the same internal  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1762) stuff this thing we have inside you  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1765) we've just been talking about your  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1766) consciousness the stuff you share with  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1768) every human being  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1769) so you transport yourself in their shoes  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1771) if you really put your mind in their  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1773) place and their time and then if you  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1777) don't look at it from your perspective  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1778) if you're a really open mind if you  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1780) would be to put yourself in their shoes  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1781) literally mentally speaking and see the  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1785) world the way they see it they were the  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1788) most lenient progressive and forgiving  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1790) and obviously that's how I see it and we  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1794) have to continue this trip we have to  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1796) continue this trip because the truth of  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1799) the matter is this is what was aslam  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1801) most seen us slaves were Muslim the  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1804) first Muslim was a woman and so on and  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1806) so on and so on  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1807) these were seen as crazy ideas  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1811) Bobby Denis Eady black cami we started a  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1814) show to come back Joe Rogan haven't been  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1816) high regard for you I mean you mentioned  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1818) you as over 100 100 of years and so the  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1822) civilizations they went through  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1823) different cycles the last cycle is when  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1825) they become corrupt decadence they start  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1828) cheating fighting killing one another  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1829) they're in fighting a lot of infighting  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1831) and these infighting causes the suicide  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1834) of a nation  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1835) so stations are not murder to commit  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1837) suicide why're you become corrupt more  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1840) corruption the more chances than being  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1842) overtaken by competing nation Islam and  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1845) Christianity kept corruption at bay now  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1847) of course there was corruption equipped  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1848) in every single typo you know we we know  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1852) that okay we have Isis the Christians  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1854) they have their kicker Cain among other  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1856) problems in the killer Catholicism the  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1858) free society yes but these are people  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1862) who did bad things but this is not a  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1864) religious not a creep it's not the Queen  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1866) so for instance if the secular American  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1868) does something wrong I don't say hey  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1869) that's the Constitution that's what you  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1871) get that's not what I say I say that  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1873) individual he decided to do something  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1875) bad and there's so much to read up  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1881) because the media loves to blame groups  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1885) to become Plato asked the very question  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1893) does God say something is good or bad  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1895) because its nature is good or bad or is  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1900) it good or bad because Allah said so  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1902) because God sent a fire therefore  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1904) whatever you sense about is bad guy by  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1906) him saying or is it its nature but is it  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1910) hot by nature then he said look if you  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1913) believe me God if Allah says something's  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1917) hot bad it's bad it only cost me more  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1919) because God is not questionable if you  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1923) don't believe in God  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1925) it's all aesthetics do you find it to be  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1929) ha  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1929) or hello is it ugly if you find me you  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1932) think it's bad if you find it to be  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1935) beautiful you find it to be good so if  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1938) there if you don't believe in a God good  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1942) and bad becomes beautiful and gonna be  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1944) fine beautiful as good whatever you find  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1945) ugly is bad if you think about it if you  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1948) think about it this is really what it is  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1950) and that's why when I was reading in the  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1952) Quran amazed they say follow your lusts  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1955) yeah well you follow your lust that's it  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1960) that's what ethics both know when  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1962) somebody tells me I hate is not what I  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1963) think I hear he doesn't want he defines  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1965) Islam to be why cuz he wasn't racist  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1969) with now there's a lot of beauty in  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1972) Islam you have to study it to know but  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1975) this president didn't study there's a  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1977) lot of beauty Christianity is about what  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1978) really integrity in Judaism as well but  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1981) you have to go beyond the rumors that  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1983) you hear because there are deep and  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1985) profound lessons in all the traditions  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1988) and people just live a superficial life  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1994) in the West generally speaking not  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1995) everybody I don't want to generalize you  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1997) know but the the recent trend is to be  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=1999) superficial  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2001) capitalism is go buy more yes there's  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2004) pork in it or what not but go buy more  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2006) consume more buy more you more happy the  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2009) truth no matter is you won't be you can  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2011) have plenty of material goods proof of  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2013) that is where is the most depression of  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2015) the world  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2018) because if there wasn't study that was  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2020) done I was quite interested in seeing  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2022) that we're focused magazine and I think  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2024) in Toledo because they looked at  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2026) depression in in countries and they said  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2029) that their top 20 was basically was the  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2031) country with the exception of I think  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2032) Nigeria well they have a real problem  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2034) number one with the USA and they take  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2037) the most depressing time yes  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2039) the most bills for cycle psychological  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2042) illness but the number of psychological  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2045) elements is on the rise how come the  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2046) pills that the cures are on the rise and  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2048) the helmets on the rise it's become an  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2050) epidemic and that's why I felt like I  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2052) had an edge growing up like I said  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2053) earlier because me I just believe the  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2057) guts that was coming a lot take  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2060) something from you strong mentally I go  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2075) through about times like everybody else  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2077) yeah but I love what comes that you  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2078) subset and said hopelessness is a bit up  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2081) you want to be I suppose they argue  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2084) about the gun you wanna bid up  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2087) hopelessness that's a bit could never  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2091) have hopelessness of course if anybody  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2093) was familiar with the serie no there's  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2095) never hope it doesn't exist again these  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2099) are these are like what one famous  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2100) writer is stephen r.covey there read a  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2103) lot of books every from every corner of  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2105) business 17 steps 7 Habits of Highly  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2108) planners he says look if you believe he  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2111) says look you got a build your are very  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2112) similar to Islamic came to me said you  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2114) have to build your life on a foundation  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2115) it's something under shakable if you  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2119) build your life that was a woman if you  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2122) build your life on your house yes maybe  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2124) your spouse lead you on in your whole  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2126) life will come crumble yes if you're its  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2130) fists you're building is built on a  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2131) stone that's shaky  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2133) you're always be insecure  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2135) so maybe you build it on your well  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2137) you're not gonna take it from me  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2138) maybe you build it on your health your  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2140) your users that's gonna be taking  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2142) everything in they're doing everything  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2143) in the world can be picking for you so  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2145) even if you have a firm grasp you always  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2147) have a deep sense of insecurity so he  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2150) says look if you believe in God but God  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2153) obviously first yeah and if you believe  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2157) you don't believe in God says at least  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2159) put your principles meaning I'm gonna be  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2163) honest respectful who are you really and  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2165) never compromised but the problem I  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2168) found the principle argument to get  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2169) second best because even yourself you  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2173) can be tempted I'm always gonna be weak  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2176) I can maybe be tempted or have a have a  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2180) have a book to a phase in my life that I  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2183) might betray my own principles it's not  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2185) sure I'm not sure yeah I think the  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2193) healthiest most technological might be  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2195) the reasons I accept this nature I have  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2197) this part of me that's miraculously  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2198) unique that science cannot even the  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2201) comment on so I will meet the permission  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2203) for this I don't need to bow down to  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2205) them and the awestruck you know I was  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2208) asking you earlier one of your favorite  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2209) pet needs it's a very advanced advice  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2218) but what have you then you tell me its  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2220) authenticity is supposedly what I was  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2223) told the Prophet taught some kids are  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2225) chasing a shadow guys won't eat why not  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2229) a shadow  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2234) yeah so I was told I was young so I  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2244) chasing the dunya maybe was paraphrasing  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2251) she's her shadow well you couldn't catch  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2253) it you can catch it  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2254) Jesus son and when they came back chase  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2259) no dunya it's like you're chasing your  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2261) shadows me never attention with the  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2264) denier exactly that was a very profound  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2267) you know so I never I never brought with  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2270) me growing up and I thought they got a  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2272) respect for my peers had a strong I  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2275) don't know how to say but have strong  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2277) backbone and I never believed something  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2279) was impossible when I started learning  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2281) to sit so any learning to teach me no  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2282) way laughs no puppy that you brought us  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2284) evolutions in the time that we yes a  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2287) while want to do an amazing so it even  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2289) if it's gonna be a short episode you  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2292) want to talk about because this is your  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2294) area especially here now there is  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2300) basically like keep it healthy  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2302) keep it strong because no place right  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2307) and this is quite a sophisticated way I  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2309) think is quite an effective one how does  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2311) our mind body and soul connection those  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2313) three things to some extent you know  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2316) satiated have to be a stimulation so I  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2320) want to talk to you about about that in  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2322) the next episode but you did like this

[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2339) you know more willing to say visually  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2342) exact things but in the next episode we  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2345) are gonna be talking about those visual  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/Pwkw85fRWtI?t=2346) exciting things and how to take care of
