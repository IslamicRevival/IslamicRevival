[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=83) universities right  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=84) engineering these studies  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=88) this is your path to allah subhanahu wa  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=90) okay  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=95) from the cradle to the grave right so  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=97) it's not just like a profession  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=99) that we spend a couple of years with but  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=101) rather  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=102) it's a journey the moment you go with it  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=107) it's going to follow you follow you up

[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=110) and this is why even some of the  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=111) scholars subhanallah before they passed  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=114) away  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=115) they would be carrying like papers of  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=119) the hadith  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=120) that they were written that they were  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=122) writing down  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=124) and uh and some of them like even on  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=126) their deathbed  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=127) a hadith would come to their minds and  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=129) they would want to write it down you see  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=131) so it's something that continues from  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=134) the moment  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=135) that you start that journey all the way  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=136) up to your death  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=138) and it requires a lot of patience it  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=141) really really does  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=142) okay i know it's a wonderful thing to be  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=145) known as the day  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=146) to be giving down to the people and it  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=148) comes with a lot of rewards as well  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=150) as the messenger sallallahu alaihi with  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=151) some said men died  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=154) canada  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=157) okay whoever calls the guidance for him  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=159) is the reward of everyone that follows  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=161) him up on that guidance  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=162) and he won't take anything away from him  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=164) and then look what he also said  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=166) women died in the  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=174) guidance for him is the sin of everyone  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=177) that followed him up on that misguidance  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=180) okay so it can work both ways  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=183) you can maybe even call it a  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=184) double-edged sword right so he requires  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=187) time it requires patience  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=195) we shouldn't try to be kind of like  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=196) hasty and wanting to be out  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=199) i remember also the shaykh of  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=202) he would say if i had the ability to  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=205) take the knowledge  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=206) and to pour it into your mouth the same  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=209) way  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=210) water and milk would be poured uh in  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=213) your throats  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=215) then i would have done that but the only  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=217) way you're going to attain knowledge is  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=219) by the scraping of the knees and the  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=220) scraping of  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=222) your toes right scraping of the knee is  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=224) the scraping of the toes and the  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=226) scraping of the elbows  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=227) so it takes time you know it takes a lot  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=230) of effort i remember when he was in  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=231) damage

[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=250) and sometimes it wouldn't even happen

[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=264) mentioned you're not gonna attain  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=266) knowledge of just the relaxation of the  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=268) body it requires effort  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=270) it requires you know time it also  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=273) reminds me of something that imam shafi  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=274) rahim allah  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=281) in mentions to how much effort you put  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=283) in okay  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=285) this is how you're going to attain  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=294) loftiness  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=296) and whoever doesn't put that effort in  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=298) he's going to be wasting his time he's  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=300) going to be chasing the impossible  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=306) okay you want to become honored you want  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=310) a high position  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=312) why do you sleep at night and then he  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=314) gives the example of somebody who's  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=316) ready to risk his life  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=318) he dives into the sea to get the pearls  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=320) from under the sea right  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=322) what kind of risk would we be willing to  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=324) take to do something like that  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=326) so uh it's my yemen like  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=329) i remember when i first got to medina uh  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=333) a brother called sheikh abdul razakh who  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=336) i benefited from  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=338) in the hambury he took me into the dorms  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=342) and he said to me about him you're going  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=344) to struggle with these dorms  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=346) huh and i said to him we got running  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=349) water  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=351) we got running electricity we didn't  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=352) even have that here man  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=354) okay so sometimes you know going out  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=357) being in places like egypt mauritania  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=360) but yemen obviously now there's a lot of  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=361) issues in yemen  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=363) you're gonna have to put a lot of effort  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=364) in okay  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=366) and that which we come out with is  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=368) absolutely nothing  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=370) to uh what the self came out with  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=373) having gone through all of the  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=375) difficulties but anyways this is a  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=378) i don't want to prolong it but i've got  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=380) a video on my youtube channel it's  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=381) called he drank his urine  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=383) six times this was the case of some of  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=386) the people of the past they would drink  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=387) their urine because they would  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=389) out of what you call it uh necessity  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=392) because they're walking in the desert  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=394) they don't have no water they don't have  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=395) anything  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=399) so that's that's very subhanallah  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=401) motivating i think a lot of people will  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=402) take a lot of benefit in gems from that  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=405) especially those who live in you know  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=407) modern day  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=408) societies where everything is fast  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=410) everything is quick everything is  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=411) accessible  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=413) um and so for that that's very  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=415) insightful i want to move on to now is  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=418) perhaps on a lot of people's mind in  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=420) many ways  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=421) could be since the elephant in the room  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=422) which is  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=424) there's a lot of kind of um refutations  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=428) you want to call it that you're involved  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=430) in or that you are associated with  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=432) maybe not directly involved in yourself  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=435) um  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=436) some time ago you came speaks corner  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=438) there was some kind of drama between you  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=440) and  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=440) oshid and um it was surrounding the case  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=443) of  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=445) haddad and a particular video  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=448) that came out basically the shiite he  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=451) went to a  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=452) that that man put out which is that he  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=454) went to a place where he was discussing  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=456) with the shia and stuff like that and  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=457) then  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=458) you know from that there was all kinds  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=460) of conclusions that were made on his  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=461) character  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=462) do i just want to ask you a direct  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=464) question do were you involved in that  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=465) were you part of the  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=467) um the backing that dalman had for that  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=470) video do you agree with that do you  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=471) endorse that  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=472) do you think that that was something  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=474) which is uh fair  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=476) that was said about or do you think that  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=479) that's something that maybe shouldn't  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=481) have been done  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=483) so there's a number of things that we  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=484) can actually mention with regards to  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=486) that right  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=487) um because you asked a couple of  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=489) questions as well  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=490) did they or did he have the backing of  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=492) myself before he made the video  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=494) okay or was it just after and so on and  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=497) so forth right  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=499) um firstly um  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=502) i personally didn't know about the video  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=504) till after it came up  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=506) i was hearing about a video that's going  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=507) to be released  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=509) okay did i know about it beforehand and  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=512) that is  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=512) that's not correct and i know now  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=514) obviously um  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=516) because of a video that went out between  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=518) him and sajid i didn't even know they  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=520) were making that video  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=521) but it comes across there that the team  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=524) was this  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=525) was it was consulted and um  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=528) and also my name was mentioned uh in  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=530) good light by both of the brothers  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=532) so one could easily think that i kind of  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=536) authorized it  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=537) which i didn't okay um  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=541) but there is mistakes that i did and i'm  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=543) not just gonna like throw somebody under  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=545) the bus and kind of free myself and just  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=547) you know run away from the situation  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=550) uh there is mistakes that i did  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=554) that i really really really regret and i  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=558) began to think more about it  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=560) when i got to medina because when there  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=562) is  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=563) um a lot of battles taking place and  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=565) you're on the ground  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=566) it's like a war zone right and sometimes  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=568) it doesn't really allow you to  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=570) just think outside of the box but when  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=573) you kind of like  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=574) just step out it allows you to look at  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=576) things in a better perspective  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=578) okay so um and of course that incident  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=582) with adnan oshida happened just before  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=584) i went to medina like i wasn't planning  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=586) to go to hyde park  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=589) me my cousin siraj i think you know him  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=591) right  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=592) we happen to be eating in edgeway road i  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=594) was you know going to be leaving very  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=596) soon so i want to spend my  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=597) some good time with one of my favorite  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=600) cousins right  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=601) so um he follows uh alidah on snapchat  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=605) so he saw adidas he goes oh let's just

[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=610) so we're going to come on to that later  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=612) anyways inshaallah to add exactly what  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=613) happened  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=615) okay just reminded me just in case i  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=618) forget  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=619) so when i got to medina um  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=622) i just really just started thinking  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=623) about this issue more some brothers  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=626) did come up to me in a very nice way and  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=628) they said you know  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=630) i just want you to you know maybe just  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=632) think about everything that you did  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=634) you know was a good thing was it not so  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=636) that got my thinking  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=638) going you know uh until one day i think  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=641) this was like two three weeks in  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=643) my brother called uma is the son of law  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=646) the son-in-law of  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=647) dr haytham right came up to me  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=650) i was saying in the haram i was reading  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=652) a hadith  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=655) and and i didn't know who he was i  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=658) didn't know who he was  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=660) and uh and uh he basically pointed out  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=664) that incident right and and he mentioned  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=667) the other incident as well about the  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=669) student loans that when we went to  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=672) kuwait so  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=674) we had discussions on a number of things  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=676) and there's no need for me to mention  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=677) now because and my journey is  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=679) but i'm going to mention this issue this  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=681) one issue

[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=698) the prices after everything started  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=699) becoming inflated right  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=702) so he said this to him i want to meet

[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=709) are asking me as none of you guys are  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=713) making a complaint  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=714) against me with regards to blood money  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=716) with regards to the wealth of the people  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=717) and so on and so forth  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=720) the people's honors come under this as  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=721) well right  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=724) and uh and ever since then  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=728) i just started thinking about i promised  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=729) him that i'm going to look into the  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=730) issue  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=731) this is right at the beginning exactly  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=733) like four years ago  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=735) that i'm going to look into it i'm going  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=736) to research the issue  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=739) and uh and to be very honest with you i  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=742) kind of just got very occupied  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=745) and but the thing just started  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=748) you know every now and again it would  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=750) just come back to life again  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=752) like in the haram being in the haram  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=755) and just seeing the different zoar like  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=757) the different tourists those who come  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=759) from  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=759) hajj subhanallah i actually began to  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=762) realize  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=763) how powerful youtube is i don't think i  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=767) realized that till  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=768) after i actually got to medina because  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=769) medina is like a central point for  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=771) muslims to come right  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=772) and people watch you online and the  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=775) repercussions i didn't see how bad it  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=776) was that actually got there  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=778) with certain things not just necessarily  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=780) my issue but  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=782) other things that happen and and  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=783) whatever have you right  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=785) so of course from allah azzawajal you  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=787) know videos going out and getting views  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=790) and  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=790) reaching different parts of the world so  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=793) every now and again i would  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=795) see people from around the world coming  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=796) up to me stopping me  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=799) many of them really just appreciating  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=801) but some people they would  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=803) just point this issue out so it's like  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=806) allah azza  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=807) was keeping this issue fresh in my mind  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=810) and to not just sleep on it  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=814) and um so two years in  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=817) it kind of like just went like that once  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=819) the two-year  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=820) mark went by i started taking this issue  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=825) much  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=825) much more seriously like brothers are  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=828) bringing their arguments  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=829) about that specific incident i'm not  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=831) speaking about  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=832) that dr haddad having gone to  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=836) shia for the purpose of uniting with  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=838) them  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=840) okay and was that the case was that not  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=843) the case  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=845) and everybody brings me the arguments  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=846) you have those who are pro and those who  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=848) are against it right  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=850) and um i really just started taking this  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=853) issue much more seriously  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=855) i think about it for a moment i don't  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=858) think any of us  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=859) want to have um  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=863) you know the oppression on our backs  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=865) something very powerful that um  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=879) send me all of knowledge it's a big  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=882) it's a big question right  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=886) responded back and he said  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=889) knowledge is too vast  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=892) but in terms of  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=905) and you're not carrying the burden of  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=906) having taken lives  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=909) okay khameer salvation  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=912) and your stomach is void from the wealth  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=914) of the people  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=918) and you've managed to refrain your  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=920) tongue from the  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=922) you know the uh the honor of people  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=923) right lazy  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=927) and you're sticking to the jamaa the  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=929) congregation of the muslims  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=931) then do so he could have told talk to  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=934) him about anything  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=936) look what he's actually advising him  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=938) about okay  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=941) and that's not a lie man it really  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=943) really isn't a light matter  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=945) and so you're studying at the same time  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=949) you know the evidence is about  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=950) volume about oppression having said  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=953) something that you shouldn't have said  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=955) because just because somebody is wrong  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=958) in something  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=959) it doesn't justify you now to start  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=961) pinning up against him everything else  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=964) okay refutations are part of our  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=966) religion okay  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=968) it's something that the sharia uh  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=971) calls to is something that is mentioned  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=973) in a hadith there's something that the  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=974) messenger  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=975) wasn't done the companion has done it  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=976) those who came after them they ordered  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=978) it  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=978) okay and even ibrutinib  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=982) he mentions some very very very powerful  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=984) statements he says  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=991) the coolest innovation their scholars  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=995) are more dangerous upon the ummah than  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=998) the people of the  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=998) noob the people who sin then he then  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1001) says  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1008) this is the messenger commanded to kill  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1011) the khawaris the kharagis that's how  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1012) they translate right  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1014) or is there any other word that you guys  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1016) use  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1018) uh he commanded that they are killed but  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1020) he said not to kill  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1022) the oppressive  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1036) is calling the people to innovation  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1039) okay  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1043) it is a must that his situation is  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1046) clarified to the people  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1047) okay and then he goes on to say well  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1053) removing his harms is more  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1057) better more greater okay  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1060) then removing the harm of a highway  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1063) bandit  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1065) okay like for example muhammad let's be  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1068) honest here if you see a pedophile  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1071) who's going to do something to our kids  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1073) right  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1074) you're going to want the people from him  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1076) right am i wrong saying that  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1079) and this is something related to  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1082) um the integrity of our loved ones and  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1085) whatever have you and likewise if  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1087) someone's going to steal something from  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1088) you you're going to warn that person  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1090) and adeen the religion of allah is far  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1093) greater than this  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1094) having said that having said that  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1098) when rebuking it requires a lot of  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1100) hikmah okay  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1102) and this is exactly what i'm allowed to  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1104) mention it goes  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1112) it is to do that which is appropriate  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1114) befitting okay  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1116) in a manner that is befitting and also  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1118) that time has to be befitting us all  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1120) and they mention three pillars first  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1123) pillar that he mentions  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1125) he has to be done with knowledge and  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1127) then he also mentions  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1130) and then he mentions the three opposites  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1132) and i'm going to comment to that  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1134) okay it has to be done with knowledge  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1136) you can't just basically say something  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1137) about someone  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1138) that is not true are you connecting this  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1140) with um  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1141) doctor yeah i'm gonna comment okay i'm  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1143) gonna come into that right  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1145) it's important that we mention this  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1146) because it's a taboo topic  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1148) and i believe sometimes there's two  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1150) extremes on this matter right  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1153) so it has to be done with knowledge then  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1154) you have also  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1157) which basically means not acting on  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1159) emotions  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1160) someone's upset you and he's angered you  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1165) i mean they usually translate as  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1167) forbearance okay forbearance  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1173) okay like somebody's angry you don't  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1175) rush to kind of like  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1176) punishing him and holding him into  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1178) account and then and that is  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1180) to just think about things like slowly  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1183) not to be hasty and rushing into it and  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1186) i believe that  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1186) i actually was very hasty just listening  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1190) to one side and seeing some parts of  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1192) some videos cut up  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1194) and i take the full blame for them  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1200) and we'll you know uh speak more about  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1202) it in a bit insha'allah  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1204) okay  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1214) announcing things right okay and  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1217) uh unveiling the secrets and of the  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1220) discussions that happen and so on and so  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1222) forth  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1222) so just rushing into things you're in  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1225) need of and  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1226) and this is something that messenger  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1228) sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1229) allah really loves when he was speaking  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1230) to  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1231) the place right in your  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1236) and he mentioned the three opposite  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1237) things of that he said ignorance  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1241) unthoughtfulness i think that's how they  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1243) translate right  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1244) and uh hastiness  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1248) so going back to what i was saying even  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1250) if the guy is a kafir  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1252) like you're a few atheists all the time  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1254) right and you speak about  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1255) the christians and i'm just bringing the  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1257) worst example here  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1259) if that christian  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1262) believes that jesus is the son of god  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1264) you are not allowed to say about him  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1265) islamically speaking and this is the  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1267) fairness that our religion came with  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1269) that jose is the son of god  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1272) you can't say about the individual what  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1275) which has no  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1276) reality whatsoever okay  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1279) he says  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1283) it's not lawful for you to oppress  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1287) any individual even if the guy's a cafe  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1290) and then he  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1291) mentioned the statement of allah  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1292) azzawajal  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1297) be fair don't let the hate that you have  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1299) for people entice you  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1300) to being unjust even if the guy is a  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1302) shia  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1304) shiite right he's cursing  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1308) and i know what you call it some of them  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1310) might have tokyo whatever have you right  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1313) but because he's now cursing morale you  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1315) can't just pin against that individual  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1320) let alone anyone else who is less in  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1322) danger  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1323) than the shiites and the christians like  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1325) the huani's even if the guy is in the  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1326) hawaii  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1328) the guy is the sufi diobandi wherever  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1330) brelvi sometimes you find that your  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1332) bandits are refuting the braves  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1334) and the other way around and this group  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1336) is refuting that group salafi might be  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1337) refuting that  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1338) you cannot say about that individual  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1341) which he hasn't done  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1342) if you're going to rebuke him rebuking  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1344) for what he said what he's done  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1346) okay and um  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1349) so i just feel like um  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1352) that issue about the shiite um  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1356) was a bit of that kind so let me just  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1358) quickly mention exactly of what kind  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1360) um it was it wasn't it wasn't it was it  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1362) wasn't fair at all  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1363) it was it was it was totally unjust so  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1367) as i'm coming up to the two years it's  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1368) really bothering me now right  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1370) why did you before you continue with  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1371) that sorry what made you come to that  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1373) conclusion now  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1374) i mean what was the thing because  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1378) so from what i understand so far in the  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1380) picture you  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1381) didn't endorse it in the today beginning  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1383) but then you  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1384) kind of looked into it and thought  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1386) actually this seems like a cut and paste  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1388) job maybe or it's being meshed together  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1390) in a way which is not  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1391) favorable makes it look uh something  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1395) that it's not so um  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1399) what exactly about it do you think is  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1401) unfair about it  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1402) okay i'm gonna come on to that so so now  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1404) the last two years  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1405) every now and again i think about it i  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1407) ask allah azzawajal to help me deal with  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1409) this issue  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1410) in the best and most correct way right  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1415) praying is tahara i've even went to the  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1417) kaaba okay  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1419) and then one year before that i dropped  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1421) a message to dr haytham  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1423) on his whatsapp i got the number and i  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1425) dropped a message to him  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1427) about the issue of tibet  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1432) right i never did that just because  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1436) a friend of mine okay  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1439) if your associates they do something  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1441) it's not fair again  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1442) for you to be painted with the same  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1444) brush i just wanted to claim myself with  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1446) him  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1446) and i clearly and explicitly said to the  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1449) i do not agree  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1450) with the stances that you take and the  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1452) views that you have and i'm not going to  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1453) go into the other things that  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1455) we discussed then because it's not right  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1458) um i discussed this right now right  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1461) um i said i had no i do not agree with  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1465) you but i did not say that  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1467) okay if abdulrahman's done today on you  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1469) i've got nothing to do with that  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1471) you see what i'm saying do you know  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1473) anyone else other than  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1474) in the in the group of the rahman hassan  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1477) that  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1477) did that pronounce that ruling on him  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1480) that called him an innovation uh let's  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1483) be more specific maybe calling the  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1485) khawani  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1485) right so you have to understand that but  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1488) is it it's anonymous for them for  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1490) like for example and he considers that  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1494) deviant sect and so therefore so this is  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1497) synonymous  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1498) the same thing yeah and i mean like just  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1500) so we're clear exactly what we're saying  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1502) in it you know  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1503) but uh if you call somebody that's  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1506) you've declared that individual to be an  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1507) innovator if you depend  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1508) if you think that yeah  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1526) many people say that you know  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1530) they're not they're not really a sect in  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1531) that sense the islamic  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1533) definition of a sect the thing is if  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1535) we're going to say ich ma  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1536) i would have to know what every single  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1538) scholar said no i don't think i've done  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1540) it  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1540) like i haven't collected every single  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1542) scholar because  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1543) means that every scholar in that time  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1547) he has to agree and take a position of a  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1548) certain yeah even even  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1550) even more problematic i was reading  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1552) sorry to cut you off  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1553) this might be a tangent but i was  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1555) reading sunnah okay and  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1556) uh i was talking about who's included in  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1559) ishmael  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1560) and what makes it more difficult is that  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1562) he actually includes the martezi lander  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1565) you know it's gonna be difficult to get  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1566) his mouth okay it's not a condition in  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1568) order for  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1569) a group to be misguided you don't always  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1571) what you call an identity for everything  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1574) in order for help them to take place  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1575) right like nothing but the force we move  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1577) them for  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1579) not even muslims i'm just speaking about  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1580) if we clearly established that  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1582) this sect sector's totally misguided do  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1585) i really need an ijmat before and hukum  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1587) can be made by a scholar  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1589) possibly not really okay before it  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1591) removes them  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1592) now i'm not talking about i'm going to  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1593) impose this on you and you have to take  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1595) this  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1596) i'm not basically saying that you have  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1597) to take my view or that yeah that's the  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1599) view  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1599) if the sheikh says and there's even  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1601) maybe even if there's one person with  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1603) him or even it is  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1604) no one ever to be a delete you know what  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1607) really matters is  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1608) the evidences that are being brought  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1609) forward right but i can't enforce  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1612) it upon you to say yeah you have to take  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1613) this and if you don't take that  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1615) you're an innovator agreed well yeah  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1619) yeah yeah this is uh it's unacceptable  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1623) yeah  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1624) what i was gonna say was that at this  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1625) point of going back to it's clear like  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1627) let's be honest that they considered him  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1629) an innovator someone who's not sunny  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1631) he said that in the park yeah about that  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1632) one he came in they said that yeah i  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1633) don't believe  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1635) blah blah blah he made that kind of  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1637) articulation so  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1639) you're saying you don't have anything to  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1640) do with that  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1643) there is a difference between declaring  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1645) somebody an innovator right  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1646) and one having fallen into innovation  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1648) that's why he says  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1661) yeah and uh and not everybody that falls  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1663) into a bidder can you call him a move  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1665) teddy  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1665) okay that's we need to really just  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1667) differentiate between the two  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1669) okay i might say okay this person has  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1673) these uh bid acts with him these  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1675) innovations with him  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1676) that doesn't mean that i'm calling him  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1678) an innovator tadia is something huge  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1680) right okay um uh  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1684) this is not a light matter so you're  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1686) saying  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1694) so for you now you have to understand  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1696) like these kind of things are normally  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1698) done in a court case yeah  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1700) and you get how to account for you know  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1702) compensations go out because of what you  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1704) say actually about a person  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1706) when it comes to taking him out keeping  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1708) him in right do you think that  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1710) so therefore do you think do you think  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1712) that that that was a mistake  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1714) well then we have to make that kind of  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1715) this no i'm saying this is an issue that  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1719) none of us should be speaking about okay  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1720) it's an issue that needs to be taken to  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1722) the scholars  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1731) these are big affairs that doesn't go  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1732) back to myself  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1734) yourself these students of knowledge who  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1737) are in the uk  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1738) even in the west this is an issue leave  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1740) it to the scholars this is their job  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1742) okay you see what i'm saying yeah so um  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1745) that's what  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1745) that's what should have happened that's  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1747) what should have happened and i said it  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1748) to both of them as well right  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1749) and even if let's be fair just to if  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1752) they took it to the scholars  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1754) and the school is pronounced  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1757) it's not we have to follow that scholar  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1759) they they have a right to say that  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1761) but that they have a right to do knuckle  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1762) of it like we need to say  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1765) do you mean by okay he's an innovator  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1767) now right  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1768) and because he's an innovator all of you  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1770) guys have to follow me on this and if  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1772) you don't follow me on this then you  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1774) you guys have got issues  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1777) yeah because sometimes a person it might  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1779) not necessarily become clear to him  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1781) yeah you see what i'm saying so there's  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1783) a lot of like things  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1784) attached a lot of strings attached and i  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1787) don't think we can go through an hour  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1788) just discussing yeah of course  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1789) a tab dear and take fear books have been  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1792) written on it yeah  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1793) the scholars have spoken about it  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1794) extensively yeah and uh  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1796) it's an academic discussion that you  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1798) need to go back to his books like i'm  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1799) talking about the viewer not necessarily  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1801) yourself  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1802) okay yeah yeah yeah so um  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1806) but yeah so your your position now is  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1808) clear i i feel like you're saying that  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1810) that was something that you think was  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1812) not the right thing to have done so let  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1813) me actually explain now how i actually  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1815) came to this point okay um  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1819) so there's like one year left now right  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1821) till this very moment right  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1823) i dropped him a message and i said okay

[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1826) right but he said look i disagree with  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1830) dr haysom's positions but what you guys  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1833) done yeah  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1833) that was oppression wow  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1837) i remember he said some he said the eye  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1838) to me  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1846) and do not do they not think that  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1848) they're gonna stand in front of their  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1849) laws  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1850) that they're going to be resurrected on

[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1857) standing in front of their laws right  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1859) at that moment he put shivers down my  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1861) back of me  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1864) and um and he basically said to me

[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1881) and then they said that he was going to  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=1882) unite with them

[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2084) flat and i was like i just i've been  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2086) thinking about how can i would you call  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2088) it  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2089) um really just get this out how can i  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2091) deal with it  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2093) and uh and then that these two videos  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2095) came out  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2097) and it's just subhanallah and it just  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2100) happened to happen you know  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2103) um so yeah so where are we at the moment  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2106) so yes  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2107) so you're at the point where i was  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2108) talking about you watched the video  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2110) seven eight times  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2111) and you came to a conclusion that you  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2113) that was  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2114) to be associated with that and to defend  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2116) that position yeah  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2118) um because like i said you know with  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2119) adam rashid yeah that discussion with  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2121) him that discussion that  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2123) uh i had with adnan rashid i stood by  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2126) that position and i even said that this  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2128) has caused confusion and everything of  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2129) what he was doing  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2131) and i've heard some of the arguments as  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2132) well that the brothers bring that he  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2134) woke up that day  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2135) to go and unite with the shia okay this  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2138) is what the whole  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2140) the whole conversation was about when i  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2143) went back to the video  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2144) the fact that as soon as they let him  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2147) speak  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2148) his blasting what's in their books and  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2150) everything and  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2151) and he keeps on repeating in kunda  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2153) nuridu  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2155) we're gonna unite  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2160) we have to we have to what treat and  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2164) cure the  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2165) because everything runs on it goes dual  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2168) you know countries are built on  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2171) and um and i heard some of the arguments  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2174) that the brothers mentioned as all that  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2176) um okay babe what are they gonna leave  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2178) like are they gonna leave just  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2180) huh uh cursing the companions and  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2182) everything else  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2184) um so even if they leave off some of  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2187) these points they're still shiites right  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2189) they're still shias  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2190) so he's gonna unite with them even  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2192) though the shia eyes  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2194) having left off some of these points  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2196) that are quite major  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2199) but at the end of the day i i kind of  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2201) think that's  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2202) how can i put this i mean the quran says  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2207) doesn't mention all the things that you  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2209) know of course even when you go into a  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2211) debate now right when you go into debate  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2216) okay get rid of this then we'll have  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2218) another discussion you see what i'm  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2219) saying yeah  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2220) and um at that time mentioned to me that  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2222) this is something that shitholi  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2224) mentioned right i tried to find it until  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2226) now i haven't found it and i'm still  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2227) looking  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2228) for it um but this is what he quoted to  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2230) me at the time  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2232) okay so i believe he was it was kind of  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2235) like just  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2236) really being fair you know he was when  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2238) he said that to me it was just  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2239) really being fair and uh so yeah when i  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2243) was in hyde park  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2245) i didn't even go there to debate anymore

[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2282) okay and the message in somalia is  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2284) really bloodthirsty  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2286) to take lives and whatever have you so  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2288) ali dawa

[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2304) guy versus this guy right  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2306) and the guy is basically getting to the  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2308) point he can't answer to some of the  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2310) ayah the verses you're saying that the  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2311) religion is barbaric and  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2312) it forces people so i just gave you all  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2314) the ayat  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2316) it's not happening right while this is  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2318) happening  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2319) adnan rasheed calls me because i want to  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2321) speak to you  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2323) and me at that point like i've heard  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2325) good things about nanoshit i don't know  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2327) him like that john fontaine said some  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2328) good things about him that they've  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2329) traveled together  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2331) and um i the only time that i know i've  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2334) done rasheed is  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2335) from the debate from the debate that  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2339) abdullah hassan when he was debating on  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2340) sarasota i was sitting there right  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2343) adnan rasheed is messaging me in a very  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2346) very respectful way okay  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2349) i know that i'm not his sheikh no i know  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2354) so but the point is he's being very  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2355) respectful yeah that's yeah that's how  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2357) he is  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2357) yeah so uh that's the only thing that  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2360) i've ever known of him  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2361) so he's saying make sure you say this  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2363) make sure this gets to him  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2365) i've never seen him from then so all my  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2367) relationship with him is a very  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2368) respectful relationship  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2369) he does he does that with with people  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2374) yeah and that's a very respectful way to  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2376) speak to someone even  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2378) yeah of course i've never told him  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2379) anything like he's older than me and  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2381) everything right so the point in all of  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2382) this is  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2383) you're speaking in a very respectful way  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2385) that's all i've ever known of you  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2387) you call me to the park like and i can  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2390) see him he's very  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2391) very angry very upset  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2395) and uh i don't understand why he's upset  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2397) why he's screwing  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2398) until we actually start the discussion  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2400) be honest i don't watch the whole  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2401) discussion  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2402) so i thought i watched bits of it like  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2405) highlights and stuff  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2406) but the gist of it from what i  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2408) understand is that basically  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2410) like you said you were you were  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2411) defending that position and he was not  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2413) he was saying  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2414) he was upset he was he was he was angry  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2416) and yeah  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2418) yeah no he wasn't even he was basically  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2420) saying uh  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2421) we we went from one topic to another  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2423) topic and no  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2424) no topics it wasn't like a healthy way  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2426) of having a discussion  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2428) okay that's why that's why even clearing  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2429) the video i keep saying okay let's go  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2431) sit there  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2432) let's go outside see the guys angry and  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2433) i miss a lot and what did he say  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2435) if you're standing up and you're angry  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2436) go and sit down if you're sitting down  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2438) and go lie down right  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2440) so um and okay i wasn't trying to  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2444) disrespect him  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2445) i wasn't being horrible towards him i  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2447) can see why he's upset  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2449) because how about this how about that  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2450) we'll put all of that behind us yeah  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2453) seriously muhammad i i i don't  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2457) mean rasheed until that debate which was  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2460) i think maybe like two weeks before  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2463) or maybe like three weeks before our  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2465) discussion in hyde park right i wouldn't  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2467) even call it even  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2467) never huh it was just i wasn't that  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2469) wasn't that was an argument  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2471) it was just an argument and and um  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2474) yeah and you know like what i would put  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2476) to you now on this on this issue around  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2478) the russians  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2479) it seems like you and him are on the  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2480) same page in a sense that you don't you  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2481) both believe in the same  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2483) things and like you're agreeing that  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2486) you know that [ __ ] that video shouldn't  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2487) be put out which i think was the main  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2490) point though let me make this very  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2491) crystally clear right i'm speaking about  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2493) that point  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2494) yeah of doctor hathan yeah yeah  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2497) um i think he was basically just trying  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2500) too hard  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2502) yeah yeah and what what said about him  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2504) like there's other things that if you  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2506) wanted to refume that you could refute  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2507) him on  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2508) but at that point i believe he was wrong  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2510) and you'd have to get someone on his  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2511) level to be fair yeah  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2513) that's yeah yeah otherwise it would just  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2515) i mean from an end user perspective  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2517) people would just  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2518) like i mean i'm happy somewhere i want  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2520) to see i want to hear i personally want  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2521) to hear  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2522) a second opinion on the student loan  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2523) issue or no no  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2525) no no the student loan yeah or the  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2528) voting issue whatever  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2529) whatever it is that positions  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2530) controversial yeah but it's got to be  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2532) someone  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2532) you know because even if say for example  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2534) let's let's let's say that people have  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2536) the knowledge  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2537) and they're younger than him yeah let's  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2538) just agree it's just not going to be  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2540) taken seriously from the end user  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2542) so if someone's on his level right and  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2544) comes out and  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2545) his age and his experience or whatever  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2548) and has the  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2549) tools that he has and provides an  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2551) academic  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2552) refutational response i'll listen to it  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2555) you know what i mean  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2556) but don't you think that's a problem  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2557) with the listener himself like in the  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2559) sense where  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2561) and of course this is what academia does  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2563) to the people right phd phd  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2565) masters masters bacclaurius i'm not even  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2568) mentioning like i'm not talking about as  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2569) qualifications i'm just i'm thinking  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2571) more about  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2572) um in the years in industry  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2576) like how long have you studied for do  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2578) you know what i mean if you're a person  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2579) i'm not  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2580) trying to take a digger anyway i'm not  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2581) obviously talking about you in  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2582) particular but  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2583) if you're a person that has barely uh  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2586) grappled with the arabic language  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2587) and doesn't know how to string a  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2588) sentence or don't know how to speak  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2590) in the arabic language and has a member  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2592) of the quran  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2593) and yeah and so on and so they don't  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2595) have animal they don't have it  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2597) or they have it on a very superficial  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2598) level and then you go out and attack  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2600) that or something  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2604) yeah or he's got much more controversial  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2605) opinions or  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2607) hamsa youssef who's got some  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2609) controversial opinions especially  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2610) you're not gonna be um accepted  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2614) and the reason why is just because the  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2616) guy's age the guy's credentials the guys  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2618) uh he's been in the game longer than you  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2620) have and it's just  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2622) it's not like for like if that makes  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2624) sense it's not like for like  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2625) so um that's what we especially on  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2629) matters where  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2629) you need you need more than more than  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2632) superficial knowledge  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2633) i i think that's my just my view on it i  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2636) might be wrong  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2637) but i think a lot of people from from  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2639) the feedback i've been getting is  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2640) they would kind of look in that  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2642) direction you know i mean someone who's  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2644) a bit older someone is  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2645) and is not personally or emotionally  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2646) invested in the issue but look  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2648) let's focus on the positives here i  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2650) think that there's the positives in this  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2651) situation is that  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2653) that people are coming towards the same  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2654) kind of understanding look  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2656) when it comes to subjective fear let's  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2658) have a more nuanced approach  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2659) otherwise i believe it's going to be  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2660) chaos there will be chaos there it's  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2662) going to just  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2662) the issue is just you're going to find a  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2665) bunch of individuals  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2666) here yeah just coming out and speaking  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2668) about these very big issues okay  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2670) i can just leave it for whatever  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2672) scholarship just let them do their thing  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2674) yeah that kind of responsibility  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2678) yeah yeah and alhamdulillah he hasn't  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2681) because if he has then we would be in  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2682) big trouble if we get things wrong  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2683) yeah you know and so that's one thing so  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2686) now you would say that  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2695) yeah i don't think i've had anything in  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2696) my heart towards him i just think the  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2698) way  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2698) you think about him shake his head yeah  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2701) yeah absolutely  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2712) he's a monster in his field the thing is  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2714) i just haven't even like  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2716) i don't personally watch videos that's  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2718) just me  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2719) the other one that i get sent i might  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2720) click on it but i'm just so  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2722) kind of like on this point i don't know  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2724) what she is  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2726) one of the top debaters in the muslim  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2729) world right now yeah  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2730) and he's got he's got stuff that you  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2731) would benefit from i'm sure he you've  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2733) got stuff he'd been  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2733) from and that's one of the biggest  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2735) tragedies in these things  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2736) both of you are working on different  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2737) lines of knowledge like you know  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2740) many people have been listening to you  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2741) now i'm thinking allah has memorized  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2742) many  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2743) you know aquael hadith you know  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2746) beautiful that's  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2747) that's that's something we're missing  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2748) because we don't necessarily focus on  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2750) these issues  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2751) but someone like on the other hand if  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2753) you want to hear about early christian  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2754) history if you want to hear about  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2756) indian history if you want to hear about  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2758) you know comparative religion if you  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2760) want to hear about you know all these  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2761) things  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2761) i mean and that's these are really like  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2765) important things i've heard he's got a  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2767) masters in  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2768) history oh yeah he's got a masters in  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2769) history degree a  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2771) master green history and it's not just  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2773) that he's been in the field for very  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2774) long he's got big collections  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2775) okay so i feel like that connection  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2778) between you and him  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2779) i'm just giving you an example  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2786) it would produce a lot more benefit for  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2788) thomas  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2789) like the fact that now you're not seeing  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2790) face to face in this  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2792) let me make this clear yeah not face to  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2794) face i actually dropped him  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2796) a number of messages if i'm not mistaken  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2799) on whatsapp i can't remember exactly  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2800) what it was  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2801) right but um i have nothing against him  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2804) i really don't  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2804) good i did try to come to a solution yes  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2807) with both parties yeah  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2809) okay about taking down the videos  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2812) because we've had this discussion before  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2813) right  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2814) that it doesn't look good it really  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2816) doesn't look good and  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2817) it didn't look like it was going to  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2819) materialize so i if anything  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2821) i try to arbitrate between both parties  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2823) to take some of these videos down  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2825) and um yeah beautiful i think you could  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2828) be  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2828) but uh but i can't remember the

[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2917) for if you're a manager of a football  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2919) team and someone's a really great  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2921) striker i remember you used this example  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2922) in saudi arabia  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2923) yeah i thought it was someone's a really  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2925) good striker  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2926) i mean someone says okay you're a great  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2928) striker come here and be  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2929) a defender do you know what i mean it's  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2932) gonna  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2933) it's the comparative balance is the team  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2934) yeah yeah the competitive advantage is  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2936) lost in a sense right  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2938) so we know what amron is good at we know  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2940) what number she is good at  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2941) we know what you're good at we know what  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2942) i'm good at we know what everyone has  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2944) advantages at everyone knows why i'm  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2946) good at magic  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2956) so so you know if we're all working like  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2959) you know  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2959) that then it works beautifully it works  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2961) in a fantastic way and no one's trying  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2962) to take away from anyone else right  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2964) no one's and you know like like  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2968) i'm gonna maybe look into this right  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2969) right now i know he has a youtube  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2971) channel and everything  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2972) yes i've kind of haven't followed him on  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2974) what he knows  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2977) i don't know much about it like i can't  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2979) you know say anything bad about him yes  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2981) with regards to that like the only uh  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2984) one that i've kind of like really just  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2986) spoken about to was john fontaine  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2988) yes when we did the podcast and uh  
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2991) you know what john fontaine is good at  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2993) right yeah  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2994) let's not leave anyone else yeah and he  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=2998) said some good things about him i can't  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3000) speak bad about a person if i don't know  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3001) him no no i've been trying to see what  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3003) i'm saying i know him  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3003) yeah so i don't know much about him  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3008) right yeah yeah  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3014) when speaking about others it has to be  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3016) of justice and knowledge not with  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3018) ignorance  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3018) and unfairness and injustice right right  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3021) as this is the situation  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3022) he says that the people of innovation  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3023) speak like that exactly man exactly  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3026) so now let's move on to another  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3027) controversy which i've been involved in  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3029) unfortunately and put my hand in and  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3032) created my own sense of controversy is  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3034) um you also  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3035) had nothing to do as far as i know with  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3038) the the leaking  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3039) or of the emails and you want to make  
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3042) that clear as well don't you  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3045) again first uh like i said earlier i'm  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3047) putting making that video or you didn't  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3048) endorse that did you  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3050) look again i was not consulted  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3053) beforehand  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3054) right as i mentioned before as well i'll  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3056) say explicitly now right  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3059) i only knew about a video just maybe  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3061) like a day or two before it was going  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3063) out that a video was coming up  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3066) i only ended up seeing the video after  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3068) it was released just like everybody else  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3070) right and i watched the video twice okay  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3073) and at the time things are happening  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3075) very very quickly very quickly right  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3078) and uh with regards to leaking of the  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3080) emails yes okay i  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3082) had i didn't even know that was  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3084) happening so another question i have  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3086) here is  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3087) did you have anything to do with leaking  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3089) emails or publicizing the lead material  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3091) okay like like i said before um i was  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3094) not consulted beforehand  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3095) i didn't even know what the content of  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3098) that video was  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3099) till it was actually released once it  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3102) was released  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3103) i saw it and uh i watched the video  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3106) okay uh thinking back on it now  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3110) was it a smart thing to do because i  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3112) heard imran's explanation now when he  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3114) was doing that video with sergey lip  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3116) was it a smart thing to do okay was it a  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3118) wise thing to do  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3119) because we know that a lot of doubt  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3123) uh has now hit the people's hearts right  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3126) and the general principle with regards  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3129) to um  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3130) spreading doubts and telling your  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3132) friends about it is  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3134) what suffered allah mentioned right  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3145) then let him not relate it to those who  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3146) sit around him  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3148) okay and let him not hit  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3160) the majority of the scholars of the self  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3163) and when we use the word salaf okay uh  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3166) what we're intending by the three golden  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3167) generations not people who are breathing  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3169) here today  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3170) the word has been tarnished the moment  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3172) you will use the word seller people  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3174) begin to think that it's referring to a  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3176) group of people okay  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3178) um we're speaking about the sahaba the  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3180) tabi in the table  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3181) i know the prophet saws  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3185) the best of his my generation those who  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3186) came out those who came after them right  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3188) so he says the majority of the salaf are  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3191) upon this tadeer  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3200) because the hearts are what weak and  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3203) that the  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3204) the doubt it really snatches a person it  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3207) can make you go haywire  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3209) because of that dao it could you see  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3210) what i'm saying  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3212) so now releasing emails and i've heard  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3215) what  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3215) imran's justification is i'm really just  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3217) still trying to  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3218) it's muslim it says  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3224) again like like i said here do you agree  
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3226) with this kind of  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3227) though oh and do you think that the the  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3230) ones who came to this conclusion  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3235) what i can say is this is one of my  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3237) regrets right this is one of the regrets  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3238) that i have  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3239) sometimes men being involved in very  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3241) controversial issues  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3243) and things related to public safety and  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3245) public fear  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3248) uh  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3251) that i may have just like saw advice  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3254) from the elderly  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3256) okay you have to understand when this  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3258) video was going even if  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3259) i did have something to say about this  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3262) video being released  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3264) we're all in our twenties at that time i  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3267) think was like 27  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3268) imran really yeah mid-twenties  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3272) um myself are on the same age so  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3276) we're all in our 20s the poet he says  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3279) and you're going to like this line of  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3280) poetry  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3288) if there is an issue that only  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3289) youngsters are  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3291) pushing through or that they are  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3292) carrying  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3294) okay uh you're going to find a  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3297) deficiency in  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3299) that uh issue that they took onto  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3302) themselves right  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3304) so this issue now of making this video  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3306) that has some very great repercussions  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3308) right  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3309) which could put the people's hearts into  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3312) doubt  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3313) and again i'm not saying that his  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3314) justification is wrong or  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3316) the uh person which they had abdul  
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3319) rahman made with regards to releasing  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3320) this video  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3322) i'm not even going into that at the  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3323) moment just thinking about it now  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3325) the least we can all agree on that  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3328) many scholars should have been you know  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3330) consulted  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3331) by leaking some of these emails where he  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3334) explicitly states that  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3335) having doubts about the preservation of  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3337) the quran or whatever have you  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3338) okay and maybe some of the elders maybe  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3340) and maybe a lot of that stuff  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3342) yeah i mean from michael with subsequent  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3344) conversations  
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3345) uh i'm not gonna say they can have  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3346) context but i'm a more nuanced than that  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3349) and  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3350) and this is why it's very important  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3351) because it can be taken out of context  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3353) as well  
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3354) it's more important that for someone and  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3356) this is very like you mentioned you  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3357) alluded to it is like hell magenta  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3360) um and this is the right so this is the  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3362) nas  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3364) and so even for me i was thinking uh i  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3366) you know i had discussion with you about  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3367) this before if this is the justification  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3369) you have muslim or let's say even in  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3372) this case  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3374) versus the  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3380) and so on that you have to keep private  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3382) information private  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3384) if you think that the muslim is is is  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3387) is there but then you have an us so  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3390) which which goes before i think i think  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3392) the discussion that he was bringing was  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3393) revolving around  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3395) him  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3399) now spreading some of this information  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3401) is email is something that is bad  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3404) right okay and the problem is  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3407) yeah later on bring this out subtly  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3411) to the people in his lectures again it's  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3413) something that is problematic  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3415) so he was coming from the angle of the  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3417) lesser retrieval the issue is we don't  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3418) know what he's going to come up with  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3419) and and still it could be in development  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3421) yeah i i fully understand  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3422) i fully understand but then they use as  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3424) a justification what he did with  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3426) juju yeah about the whole zombie thing  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3429) again it's not something as you just  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3431) mentioned now it's not qatari that he's  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3433) going to do this  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3434) it's not even that it's not that your  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3436) understanding of what he thinks is what  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3438) it was what the understanding is  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3440) you could definitely say that you could  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3441) definitely say that but as you mentioned  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3443) there is no source which speak about  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3445) what you call it  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3446) preserving the the the secrets of the  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3449) people even that narration i mentioned  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3450) earlier  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3456) what does it mean like secrets being  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3458) revealed to the people right  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3460) one thing that really touched me is this  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3462) narration i'm going to mention in a  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3463) moment but before that the messiah  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3465) says  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3470) if somebody you know tells you something  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3472) and then he begins to look  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3474) you get indications that this is a  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3476) secret yeah of course this isn't a man  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3478) it's a trust but look at this narration  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3481) right  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3484) he said um  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3496) and he sent me to go and do something  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3500) and i ended up becoming late my mom was  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3503) waiting for me and i was late right  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3505) so when i came home he she asked him  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3509) why was you late he said  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3512) he was in some  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3520) what did he ask you to do ana malek  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3524) responded back and he said  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3526) this is a secret look at her response  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3530) and allah i think every single one of us  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3532) can take really just  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3534) um inspiration and a lesson from this  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3537) right  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3549) now comes in a negative context in  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3550) arabic language indicates  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3552) generality what do we do as muslims  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3555) someone told us something the first  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3557) people that we tell is what the wives  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3560) my wife is not with an s but  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3563) we tell the wife okay here it's i said  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3565) nobody  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3567) we might tell our close ones every  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3569) friend has a friend right and  
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3572) um every friend has a friend  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3575) and you know what tends to happen say  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3576) well you're not gonna tell anyone  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3578) and he goes to someone else say well  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3580) he's not gonna tell anyone and he goes  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3581) to someone else  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3582) i can before you know where that secret  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3584) is turned into chinese whispers while  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3586) the name of allah is being used in vain  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3588) so this is the assal okay this is the  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3591) assad with regards to discussions that  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3592) happen in privately  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3594) in private but that particular issue as  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3596) to whether this is something that is  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3597) justified because the lesser of the two  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3599) evils  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3602) on this scale thinking about it in  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3605) hindsight  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3607) which involves the religion of people to  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3610) be doubted  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3613) because at that time i was told that a  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3615) series of refutations or clarifications  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3617) are going to be made with regards to  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3619) the leaking of the emails which i didn't  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3621) which  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3622) didn't happen but now um  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3625) when you did that video with uh startup  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3628) i don't know whether he clarified  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3629) everything or he's planning to clarify i  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3631) still haven't watched it i mean the  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3632) thing is like i said  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3633) before i'm i've i've spoken to you  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3635) myself  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3636) and and the stuff is that he is  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3639) constantly reviewing  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3640) and reading and changing and  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3644) you know what i mean so that's why i  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3645) think this is very important  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3647) if something is to be refuted publicly  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3649) it has to be said publicly  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3651) and and that's why it's very dangerous  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3653) for someone  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3654) to to challenge that which is private  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3658) privately uh publicly and vice versa  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3662) but i think we agree on this point yeah  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3663) and i think at the end of the day again  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3665) it goes back to that same point i  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3666) mentioned earlier  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3668) that sometimes it's best to take  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3670) sensitive issues back to the elders  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3672) scholars exactly every scholar has  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3674) somebody that he goes back to  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3676) okay so do you think there was too much  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3679) kind of issue had been done  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3680) by the group members yeah maybe so okay  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3682) something very powerful that i want to  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3683) mention with regards to what even hasn't  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3684) mentioned  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3685) right and i really just wish that in the  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3687) past that i acted upon it  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3689) he said  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3693) how beautiful is silence in very  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3695) sensitive issues  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3704) how often have we seen people who are  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3706) destroyed because of what they say with  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3707) their tongues  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3708) but we've never seen anybody who who's  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3711) destroyed himself because he was silent  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3715) so these issues i just kind of sometimes  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3718) wish that  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3720) um i may not have what you call it  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3724) partake or partook  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3727) in any of them and um even now  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3730) subhanallah this video that i was making  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3733) i consulted a lot of the elders uh  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3736) there's a number of them they they don't  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3738) agree like they're not with they clearly  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3740) explicitly like  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3741) osama uh stevenson who runs medina  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3744) college i think you've met him before  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3746) right  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3747) and other brothers as well but i thought  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3748) their permission to maybe mention their  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3750) names and they said  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3751) just leave out like even they clearly  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3754) stated that they don't have anything to  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3757) do with the dawah of  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3758) dr haytham they don't agree with his  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3760) views and the stances that he's taken  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3762) while at the same time they said to me  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3764) that was oppression man  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3767) that thing that was said about dr  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3768) haytham and the way he was made to look  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3770) out  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3771) it wasn't it wasn't you know with  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3773) himself really wasn't with fairness  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3776) you know so um even though they've got  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3779) nothing to do they don't have  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3780) cooperation with dr haitham and they're  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3782) still saying  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3783) this particular thing and this goes back  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3785) to what i mentioned earlier  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3786) if you're a real sunni a person who's  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3788) following the truth and  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3790) upon the guidance of the seraph if  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3792) you're going to refuse somebody has to  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3793) be with ill  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3794) and he  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3802) justice is that you weigh your opponents  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3805) huh with the same bold that you weigh  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3808) yourself with  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3808) meaning you treat the people the same  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3810) way you like to be treated  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3813) i mean there is even more isn't it  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3820) even if it is against yourselves and  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3822) your parents and um  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3824) well you know what something that really  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3825) touched me was um  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3828) the way ebeneutemia was with his enemies  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3833) his student he mentioned his madaja  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3835) salikin right  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3850) some of his own friends mentioned i wish  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3853) i could treat my friends  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3855) the same way that ibrutimya can treat  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3857) his enemies  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3859) or the same way entertainment treats his  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3860) enemies and his opponents  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3863) right i mean i thought we had a  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3864) different approach to me remember that  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3866) me  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3866) yeah why i i i i i read something in  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3869) this  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3869) um you're saying  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3872) i wish you being tamiya was a little bit  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3874) more uh  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3876) yeah yeah yeah a little bit more calm  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3879) with his enemies or something like that  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3880) yeah  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3880) i don't want to rescue him yeah but even  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3883) subhan look at this other incident right  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3885) and we're just defending him in the team  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3887) you're here um  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3904) i came to give him the good news that  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3906) one of his greatest  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3908) enemies had just passed away look what  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3911) his response was  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3917) he told me off he showed his unhappiness  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3920) to  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3920) me giving him this good news and he said  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3926) look what he did he ran to his house  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3930) and he said to his family today  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3934) i'm going to take the same place that  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3936) your father had  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3937) anything that you guys need from me that  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3939) today is like

[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3945) so this guy let's get straight he goes  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3950) i'm going to take his place anything you  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3951) guys um  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3955) see that can be taken another way i  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3957) guess  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3961) treat your enemies a bit you know yes  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3963) yes treat them a bit nicely  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3964) so a question i want to personally ask  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3966) you know because you've brought that up  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3967) and we had to be fair right  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3969) um do you think it was a good idea to  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3972) bring  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3972) dr yasser like with a lot of these  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3975) doubts that are surrounding him and some  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3977) of these issues that he's having  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3979) okay and ask him some of these questions  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3982) i think so because  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3983) because now the christians are partying  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3985) what i've seen in my own eyes  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3987) they're commenting on different videos  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3988) i've been sent screenshots do you think  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3990) it was a good idea i think to be honest  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3991) the idea for me to ask him those very  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3993) specific questions  
[1:06:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3995) were was a bad idea and because i'll  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3997) tell you why it's a bad idea not because  
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=3999) there should be any reason why  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4000) christians missionaries or  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4002) evangelists should be it's a bad idea  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4004) because we were talking about complex  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4005) issues  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4006) and this suffer had no idea what we  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4009) were even trying to communicate and they  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4011) did distort what he was saying and he  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4013) put out a public statement saying i  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4014) don't agree with what you're saying it's  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4015) very important by the way  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4017) he did this to me i don't think i saw it  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4018) no no he put it on facebook he said  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4020) whatever you're saying i believe the  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4021) quran is preserved a hundred percent and  
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4023) you know well he he refuted that but  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4025) me asking him very specific questions  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4028) like if i give you a mushaf and  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4029) uh would it be exactly what the prophet  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4033) now  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4034) i know he has a view which is that's not  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4036) the case that's  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4037) traditional view and it would be a mix  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4039) of the like he said on the podcast it  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4040) would be a mix of  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4042) which really to us is not problematic  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4043) view right if it's a if he's  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4045) if we extend obviously if he's if you're  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4048) saying there's more  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4049) things that he's saying that could be  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4050) problematic we have to see that publicly  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4052) right because it hasn't come with that  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4053) publicly yet  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4054) but that what he said in the podcast  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4057) yeah  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4057) was not anything near kufr what he said  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4060) in the  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4060) in the podcast was nothing free or or  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4064) it was just something which was you know  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4066) how he was being  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4067) he was being charitable right and  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4069) because he  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4070) like he like he said the thing he's got  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4072) this kind of academic hat that he puts  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4073) on right  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4074) so he put the academic hat on and he's  
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4076) speaking charitably right and speaking  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4078) honestly  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4079) and that honesty and that charitable  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4082) speech  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4082) which is actually i've been looking at  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4084) these messiah illinois  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4085) it's been misconstrued by them and has  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4088) been taken out of context by them and  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4089) they see as a reason to celebrate like  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4091) you said  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4091) which is totally bartender false and so  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4094) i think from that angle asking them  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4096) those very technical specific questions  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4098) was totally for me the wrong thing to do  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4101) especially knowing that there could be a  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4102) potential he could answer in that  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4104) controversial way because he started to  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4106) cut you but  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4107) remember when i mentioned earlier um  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4109) what suffered he says  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4112) whoever he is in innovation i think you  
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4115) know these doubts and these  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4116) the way he's kind of putting it for me  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4120) right i don't hear anything for me do  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4122) you see what i'm saying so  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4123) i was asking him and obviously what he  
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4126) came with was something  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4127) which the the articulation was  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4129) misconstrued by these people because he  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4130) was speaking charitably speaking in an  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4132) academic way i mean and and i think he  
[1:08:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4134) needs to kind of think about  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4136) the way he puts things across 100 that's  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4139) something he'll look at i'm  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4140) 100 sure we'll all look at the thing is  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4143) my  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4143) my platform that we're speaking from now  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4145) everything has to be watertight because  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4148) who is going to be the first person  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4149) that's watching i know people are  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4150) watching it now that are going to be  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4151) non-muslims not only that by enemies of  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4152) islam  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4153) now he's if you're speaking in the  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4154) university right which is used to do it  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4156) as a professor you're not going to speak  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4158) in the same way in a political  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4160) water type way where you're going to  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4161) speak in a little bit more relaxed way  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4162) you're going to have a more  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4163) more nuanced approach  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4166) let's say for this because these people  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4170) are ready to take anything out of your  
[1:09:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4172) so i get this point yeah and i think  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4173) he's everyone's learning from this but  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4176) i remember for me i have to take  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4177) responsibility for my own my what my own  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4179) actions are  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4180) i shouldn't have asked the doctor  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4183) i should have asked him a question  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4185) specifically about  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4187) something very technical to a lay  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4188) audience which i know he has  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4191) opinions which which i'm not going to  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4194) say are controversial  
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4195) i'm going to say are anti-normative in  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4198) many aspects or some things which are  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4200) not  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4201) completely in line with the traditional  
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4202) view you see what i mean  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4204) so i should not ask him that question  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4206) especially before he hasn't even  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4207) published anything about it  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4209) the the classical view let's call it the  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4211) view of the quran let's say  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4213) so so that's it uh and and um  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4216) the fact that you're i think that's  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4218) jason i think that that i really regret  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4219) that actually yeah  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4220) asking him because not only regret on  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4222) the on on on the front that  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4224) um i asked him that question he answered  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4226) in the way that he did yeah which was  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4227) charitable and all that  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4229) but also because of the the the way in  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4231) which  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4232) it's been manipulated and distorted  
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4235) the consequences of it i personally feel  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4238) like  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4239) that could have been avoided if i had  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4240) not asked that question and i'll take  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4241) responsibility for that hmm  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4244) yeah yeah so on these  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4248) like i i always tell brothers this right  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4250) and i'm the first person to advise  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4252) myself  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4253) something like mentioned right so  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4267) indeed just speaking in a very general  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4269) way sometimes  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4270) what does it cause without clarification  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4272) what does it cause it causes  
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4274) the minds of the people to become very  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4275) messed up yeah  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4277) and also i mean some people can take  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4280) what you say  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4281) and distort it but once again of course  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4283) you can't just always shut up every type  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4285) of  
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4286) enemy that comes at you but the most you  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4288) can do is just kind of like  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4290) but what i want the muslims to realize  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4291) about this right  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4293) is that causing this is very important  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4297) attacking yes on this point  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4301) is not a good idea okay attacking him  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4305) is is a fitna attacking his view that he  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4308) hasn't even publicized is a fitna  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4310) because it will make them reaffirm  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4313) their narratives or he's talking about  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4315) preservation not once that he mentioned  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4317) present by the way the word preservation  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4319) i don't think once he mentioned he was  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4320) talking about that's what he was talking  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4322) about  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4322) so and they they've marketed it as  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4324) preservation of quran which is different  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4327) and what i want the muslims to realize  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4328) is that okay if he comes out with a bath  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4330) with a research which is against the  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4331) quran whatever there will be majel there  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4334) will be a space  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4335) for refutation of that bath in an  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4336) academic way  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4338) if there's something that people  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4339) disagree with but attacking  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4341) only affirms the distorted narratives of  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4344) the  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4345) these christians and yeah and the quran  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4346) says  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4349) you know this is very important when  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4350) harun came back uh samus came back  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4353) and harun was there  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4355) [Music]  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4360) do not make me uh do not make the enemy  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4363) open for me right in a sense  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4364) because you think about it the way he's  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4366) looked at in the west  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4368) the way he's looked at in the west the  
[1:12:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4370) guy with the academics the guy who's  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4371) seen as the  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4372) one of the leading figures in the west  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4374) right if you make him look like  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4376) that he has got doubts about the quran  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4379) yeah why would you okay  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4380) yeah is going to just come down like  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4388) is strongly connected to right in many  
[1:13:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4390) different parts of the world right  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4392) right if tomorrow and may allah is  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4395) saving from this  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4396) starts having doubts somehow imagine the  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4398) repercussion he would have  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4399) yeah i'm not saying he's on the same  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4400) level or even he has that kind of impact  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4403) that he has in the west but imagine that  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4406) repercussion that will happen  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4407) exactly yeah you see what i'm saying so  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4408) i think that we have to be very careful  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4410) with these missiles  
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4411) and i think that people from all sides  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4413) the quran is something which unifies  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4414) jamie sorry  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4420) right here and they take the ayah i'm  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4423) talking about the fork of islam  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4424) not the ones  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4439) this is the quran that we are much more  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4440) ali we have  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4442) ishmael so this if we if we're talking  
[1:14:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4445) about something which everybody  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4447) all of the people ashari athari um  
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4452) all of them all of these have agreed  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4453) upon what the quran is  
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4456) from the beginning to the end of the  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4457) book so  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4459) now these individuals want to make this  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4461) very important they want to make it seem  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4462) as if there's  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4465) a quran what is the quran we can't allow  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4468) them  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4468) because for a thousand foundries there's  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4469) no khilafana we know what the  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4472) yeah we know what the we know what the  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4475) we don't know exactly what a specific  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4476) notion  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4476) but we know what the the idea is  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4478) variation yeah  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4480) we know all of these things and so to  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4482) for them to to to  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4483) to come in and and speak in that manner  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4485) we cannot allow that  
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4487) uh and then using one of the dua to  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4489) whatever we say  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4491) yes his status in the west  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4494) especially on academic level is is very  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4497) high  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4498) so so in terms of influence whatever  
[1:14:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4499) your view on quality is or  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4501) or yes whatever your view on him is  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4504) he's still listed in if you like the 500  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4507) most influential muslims in the world  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4508) he's still got he's done what he's done  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4510) so it doesn't make sense to have a harsh  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4512) approach with him and to count a  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4514) cancelling approach to him and  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4515) it doesn't work like this we have to  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4516) have a nuanced approach and wait for the  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4518) publications  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4519) and and then deal with accordingly i  
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4521) think this is what we need to do  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4522) would you agree with this yeah of course  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4524) yeah so if he basically came out like  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4526) i'm just asking you this right if he  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4528) came out and  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4529) some of the things had you know uh  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4531) problematic things inside of it  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4533) yeah um you wouldn't have a problem just  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4535) coming out just literally  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4537) i would have i would have a problem  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4539) refuting what that is that he's saying  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4541) you know what i'm saying i'm not me  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4542) personally do a knuckle of those who  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4544) have said like if i if i disagree with  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4546) dr i'll tell him directly i'll say  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4547) listen this this doesn't make sense what  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4549) you're saying oh this doesn't make sense  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4550) what you're saying  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4551) i have no problem with that another  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4552) question i want to ask you is about  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4554) this kind of cancer culture people  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4557) cancelling people out because of  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4558) association guilty by association  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4561) so they do a tab dia maybe from their  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4563) own volition without the consultation of  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4565) the scholar  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4565) and then they'll say whoever's  
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4567) associated with this person who's  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4569) themselves as an innovator and this just  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4572) causes division like unnecessary  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4574) division  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4574) and it's untenable in the ummah having  
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4577) said this now  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4578) what is your stance on this if for  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4580) example i would if you were to see  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4582) uh if i were to see you could i see you  
[1:16:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4583) in in a mosque which is potentially like  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4586) a diobandy mosque  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4587) or even uh brelvi mosque or something  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4591) do you see an issue with  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4594) um doing higher doing good in places  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4597) spaces which are not especially or  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4599) specifically selfie spaces  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4601) or do you think that there's a more  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4602) sophisticated approach to this i think  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4604) this question can be  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4605) maybe uh answered in two parts right the  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4608) first part is  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4610) um going to the masajid  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4614) of those individuals who might not  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4616) supposedly be upon the sunnah right  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4619) i wrote an article in 2015  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4623) okay and i gave you the worst title  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4626) possible  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4627) the permissibility of going to the  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4629) message of the  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4631) the people of innovation right because  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4633) what was happening at the time was  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4636) there was this group of people who were  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4639) blasting individuals who are trying to  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4640) quote the sunnah simply because he went  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4642) to this masjid  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4644) and that message isn't necessarily even  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4646) seen as  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4647) a messy that propagates innovation they  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4649) might just have tendencies because of  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4652) culture and where they came back where  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4654) they came from back home right  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4657) so the moment a brother goes there pdfs  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4660) are being put together  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4661) putting his picture and then someone  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4663) else's picture a previous speaker came  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4664) there  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4665) and then this message what they've done  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4666) or whatever have you  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4668) it was kind of becoming a bit of a  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4669) pandemic right okay  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4672) the moment a brother goes through that  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4674) message he's being labeled straight away  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4676) and um i put this article together like  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4681) as a as a defense for some of our  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4683) brothers who were being ripped apart  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4685) even scholars were being ripped apart  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4687) because of this particular issue  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4688) he went to this message that that means  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4690) that he's associated with them he's with  
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4692) them  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4694) this article that uh also my brother  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4696) said  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4698) we put it together and we translated  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4702) some of the  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4702) aqua of the scholars and in this  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4706) pdf we had the likes of uh  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4710) saying that's even permissible to go  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4712) into a church and give the hour there  
[1:18:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4714) and you also had uh uh  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4717) right yeah who went to the tijani and he  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4722) gave dawa in their masjid and  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4723) whatever have you who was there yeah  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4727) yeah so you have him doing that you have  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4729) i remember i also  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4730) saw affect  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4736) he had a similar effect with this and so  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4738) many other scholars i try to keep it as  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4740) neutral as possible by bringing  
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4742) you know the statements of the scholars  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4744) right uh from both sides  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4747) yeah you had even  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4751) if you just think about it for a moment  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4754) northern yemen was all shiites  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4758) right he was by himself he was like his  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4760) 80 right  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4761) who left to saudi arabia studying  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4763) university took a masters from there  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4766) and and he came back to give da'wah  
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4768) subhan allah  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4769) like we can actually say that  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4772) uh jamaica islamia the university of  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4774) medina  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4775) they have a big father over the people  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4777) of yemen because they taught him  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4779) he came back he took on the methodology  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4782) of the  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4783) sunnah right and he started giving  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4785) da'wah and that whole province is shiite  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4789) subhanallah i even had stories from some  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4790) of my masha's saying that  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4792) shaykh mobile used to be in the masjid  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4795) and he would say oh you believe  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4799) and there would only be one person there  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4802) and then  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4802) one time that individual came up to the  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4805) sheikh and he said to him  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4806) why do you keep saying because this is  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4810) what plural right  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4811) i'm only one person maybe the angels are  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4813) there  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4814) because i'm only by myself so the sheikh  
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4817) would go  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4818) out to their marketplaces he would be  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4819) giving dawa to them  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4821) so much so that what happened many  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4823) people started becoming sunnis  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4826) and the congregation started increasing  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4828) but the share would be going out to them  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4831) even my own shaykh abdul hamid he used  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4834) to specifically this is like  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4836) maybe in the last 20 years he used to go  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4839) out to the masajid of the shia and he  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4842) would speak about the virtues of alibaba  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4846) he's got nothing to do with shiaism  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4848) right he would grab the mic and as soon  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4851) as he grabs the mic you can see the  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4852) congregation getting worked out they  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4853) want to do something to him  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4855) he will say the reminder inshallah will  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4857) be after the sunnah prayer  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4859) on the virtues of every time they would  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4860) cool down a bit i heard this in my own  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4862) ears  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4865) and he would then start speaking about  
[1:21:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4866) the virtues  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4872) whoever  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4884) so he's propagating the sunnah while at  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4888) the same time he's using ali namit  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4890) to speak about the issue they are  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4891) involved in you see what i'm saying  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4894) so so much hair came out of it they they  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4896) even said if this is a  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4897) sunnah then anytime come you know  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4902) so um like ahi this is i don't want to  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4904) say unanimous agreement from the  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4906) scholars  
[1:21:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4907) um but there is so many statements so  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4910) many statements  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4911) from the scholars saying so the idea  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4913) that we can even put the  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4914) article under the video right yeah i  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4917) wrote this you're saying  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4918) you're saying that you're talking about  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4921) um  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4922) people being associated with people of  
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4925) different  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4926) understandings him going there giving a  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4928) lecture  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4929) propagating whatever he needs to  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4930) propagate and i'm not talking about  
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4931) compromising  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4932) you know sometimes what happens the  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4933) person comes and he's compromising the  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4936) innovation he might even go as far as  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4938) like acting like it's perfectly fine so  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4940) it's like talent  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4942) okay when  
[1:22:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4957) uh and i always mention this right that  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4960) cooperation can be in a  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4963) way where sometimes the government  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4967) they need everybody to come over from  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4968) different groups  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4970) they've got issues related to the  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4972) massage they need signatures  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4974) okay this is now a form of cooperation  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4976) of course  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4978) you're not compromising you're not  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4979) compromising your religion you're going  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4980) because  
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4981) that person you're not mixing exactly  
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4984) right  
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4984) that person who works in the government  
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4987) he looks at all of you guys and you guys  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4989) are the same he don't care  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4991) huh and um all you guys are coming  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4994) together  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4995) you guys need to attend that meeting you  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4997) need to sign  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=4998) whatever paper you guys need to sign and  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5000) you have to show a united front  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5002) on that issue so that's one form of  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5006) tower  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5007) and there is nothing wrong with that  
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5008) because there is a bigger  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5010) facet at stake here of course imagine  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5012) all the massages if you don't come to  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5014) this meaning all the messiah gonna be  
[1:23:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5015) closed down  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5016) or there's issues related to hijab or  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5018) whatever have you  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5019) and what's being taught in the schools  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5020) to our youngsters you're gonna attend  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5022) right i've attended that in the past as  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5024) well yeah but then you have  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5026) cooperation on a dower level is this  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5028) possible muhammad  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5030) let's be fair here right i'm calling to  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5032) talk i'm calling to the sunnah  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5034) and you've got a guy next to me sitting  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5036) on the same panel he's calling to bid  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5038) and he's calling to it's okay for you  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5040) not to call on to the messenger  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5042) when you visit his grave when you go to  
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5043) medina  
[1:24:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5046) these are two opposites that um they  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5049) just don't come together right  
[1:24:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5051) and this kind of cooperation of course  
[1:24:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5053) is battle this is now  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5055) look next thing with i'll tell you a  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5057) story okay  
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5058) of my own self um when i was doing  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5062) some postgraduate research in uh  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5065) so as university okay and there was one  
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5069) lecturer that i had who was who was  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5072) lecturing you yeah he's appear he's a  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5073) phd holder and  
[1:24:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5074) i'm not going to mention his name well  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5076) he's basically  
[1:24:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5078) in my opinion as in dick okay i know  
[1:24:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5080) that's a very harsh statement to make  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5081) but he's basically  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5084) any no explain to people he's a heretic  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5087) yeah yeah it's something that takes you  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5090) out of the face  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5091) of islam okay so he was spouting that on  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5093) a daily basis okay  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5095) and he was just disguising him in  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5098) islamic jogging and stuff like that  
[1:24:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5099) was he like a non-muslim or was he like  
[1:25:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5101) a muslim he was a muslim name  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5102) he claimed to islam he has an appearance  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5106) okay now remember the cluster we were in  
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5109) was can was a mix of muslims and  
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5112) non-muslims  
[1:25:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5113) so there's this is a dao thing right in  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5115) a sense because when he's now making  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5118) that all the muslims agree upon okay  
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5121) it's upon us the people in the class who  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5124) were a mix they were selfies in the  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5126) class there were dear band in their  
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5127) class and they were braves in the class  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5129) yeah all three were in that class it's  
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5131) upon us  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5132) to show united front so that the  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5134) non-muslims can see this is something  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5136) outside of anything that any muslim has  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5137) ever said does that make sense  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5139) so clearly um in that situation it's a  
[1:25:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5143) kind of town  
[1:25:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5144) it was mutual it wasn't even something  
[1:25:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5146) which we all came together and said  
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5148) let's sign a document of town or  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5149) something like that but it was just that  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5151) yeah i agree with what he's saying here  
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5153) yeah i agree with  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5154) and this is a kind of town okay in a  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5156) sense and  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5158) what i'm trying to say is that it's  
[1:25:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5159) always contextual that the person who is  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5161) brotherhood might believe in this  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5163) yeah he might believe in this it's just  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5164) like a sultan and many of the big  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5166) scholars did right and they had to  
[1:26:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5167) will for us  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5175) and no one's kicking them but when you  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5176) say muhammad is not always what you call  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5178) it  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5198) many of the big scholars of islam  
[1:26:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5199) because no one's taking the sukky of  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5201) the fault of islam he's written big  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5204) uh usually attracts and so on well i'm  
[1:26:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5207) saying well i'm not trying to say that  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5208) let's  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5209) let's mix that right yeah but what i'm  
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5210) saying is that that's yak there  
[1:26:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5212) it was mutually understood by almost  
[1:26:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5214) everybody in that class  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5216) just just unfortunately  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5219) that we need to back each other on these  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5221) because this huju mat  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5223) are bigger than this it's actually  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5226) bigger because  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5226) you're putting it into the quran and to  
[1:27:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5228) complete this repeat you put in the  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5229) the prophet was being in question all of  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5233) these things  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5234) this is it's a battle between a man and  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5236) kufr like in the clearest and  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5238) non wheelie sense the people the  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5240) brothers and uh  
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5242) and sisters because they are muslims  
[1:27:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5243) that they argue for is from the  
[1:27:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5245) background or for whatever polemically  
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5247) they do so within the paradigm and this  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5249) is very important  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5251) i'm not saying it's justified well we  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5252) agree of course  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5254) but what i'm saying is that they still  
[1:27:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5256) cling to hadith and they still work  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5257) there  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5258) they still took quran sunnah you get it  
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5259) they still they have the paradigm  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5261) these people yeah the same right in a  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5266) sense  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5266) you could argue that before i think  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5268) people might not understand that word  
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5270) you know maybe a reference  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5271) so so we take our religion from the  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5272) sexual references all the same  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5274) whereas the progressives and this also  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5277) progressive muslims as a whole  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5279) like i can even mention them by name and  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5281) naimy i think his name is  
[1:28:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5282) um amino dude and these individuals  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5285) they've left the paradigm  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5286) okay and this is in these spaces and  
[1:28:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5289) this is a space that i think many people  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5290) endow i'm not  
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5291) not aware of the academic space this is  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5293) the battle the battle is between the  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5294) progressives and the traditionalists  
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5296) and they put traditionalists all in one  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5298) box like for us the salafis and the  
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5299) braves and the abandons they don't care  
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5301) about that  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5302) because they're tackling the core of  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5305) religion because the thing is what they  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5306) want to change  
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5308) they want to change our morals do you  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5310) see the point and  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5311) by and large that the brelvin and the  
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5314) obama and the salafi all three of them  
[1:28:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5316) have this very similar um  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5320) practices they'll pray five times a day  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5322) they'll wear their cab there  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5323) make sure you're a bit specific because  
[1:28:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5324) you could talk not talking about i'm not  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5326) talking about stephan here but i'm  
[1:28:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5327) talking about  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5328) visible practices like a salazar  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5332) yeah i've got hajj and so on yeah and  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5334) even haram take this masala away of  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5337) of uh which this clear disagreement no  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5340) one's going to  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5340) no one's going to lie about that any  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5341) things that are basically above the  
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5343) surface that yeah  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5344) like for example exactly yeah yeah so  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5347) visible practices  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5348) so for them i mean do you think that  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5350) yani this progressive muslims or those  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5352) who put them in their place who the  
[1:29:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5353) i would call them the colonial masters  
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5355) they don't they don't care  
[1:29:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5357) if you believe in this to be honest  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5360) they all they want to do is they change  
[1:29:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5363) now i'm not suggesting this is not an  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5364) important topic  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5365) okay i really am not suggesting i want  
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5367) to make this very clear i'm not  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5368) suggesting that there should not be  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5369) those debates and those  
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5371) uh refutations because we're talking  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5372) about islam  
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5374) yeah yeah yeah someone believes so  
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5378) this is something which we're not  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5379) compromising one at all yeah very clear  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5381) yeah  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5381) however we need to know which yani where  
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5384) to where where to position the  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5386) the gun in the sense that in in in the  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5389) different cases and in situations you  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5391) find yourself in so  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5392) in this in this case i'm talking about  
[1:29:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5393) my specific experience here in  
[1:29:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5395) in the universities like when they when  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5398) you're  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5398) questioning the existence of prophet  
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5400) muhammad the existence or  
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5402) they even existed the the quran is  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5406) there and this is a combination of this  
[1:30:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5407) and now we have to  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5410) sorry but that is actually that's more  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5412) of an issue we have to tackle this  
[1:30:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5413) first because the kafir who's listening  
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5415) to or the muslims listening to it  
[1:30:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5417) is going to think well why do i need to  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5420) join this religion in the first place  
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5421) they won't even get into the discussion  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5423) phase two of okay  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5424) what's the hadith say about them  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5428) and so on you know what i mean they  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5430) don't care about that and they don't  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5431) know about that because their master  
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5432) is completely different so we have to  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5433) bring them into the fold first then have  
[1:30:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5434) the discussions  
[1:30:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5436) so that's why i feel like when we when  
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5438) we say dawah we have to be specific  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5439) because  
[1:30:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5440) it's there are forms of dawah where even  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5443) like you just said like for example  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5446) or um sex education in the schools do  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5450) you think they'll say salafi  
[1:30:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5451) let's come in uh something that is uh  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5454) attacking the united front it does  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5456) require united front and so long as  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5458) someone  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5459) someone who is claiming to be a muslim  
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5461) they can they can work together  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5462) other muslims on it even shia and sunni  
[1:31:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5465) even sunni  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5466) there's some issues that that the it is  
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5469) for both  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5470) halal me for example right in a school  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5472) you work in the school for example  
[1:31:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5474) this guy i'm not going to cooperate with  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5475) him because he's a shiite and that would  
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5477) be  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5478) foolish especially if you're a majority  
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5480) population and you're sunni  
[1:31:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5481) so you're not going to join the effort  
[1:31:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5483) of the shiite for example who wants to  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5484) promote halal and me  
[1:31:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5485) so all of this town right and what i'm  
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5487) trying to say but i think we we  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5488) we have common grounds in what we're  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5490) discussing yes that ta'awein is of  
[1:31:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5492) different  
[1:31:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5492) cooperating yeah and cooperation is of  
[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5495) different levels  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5496) right okay so i think one thing we need  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5498) to be very careful here is  
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5500) uh a way which uh some of this  
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5503) cooperation can be done  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5504) without acquiring the beliefs you know  
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5507) becoming mixed with one another right  
[1:31:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5509) and then  
[1:31:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5509) falsehood and also that which is correct  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5511) becoming mixed with one another  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5512) okay and also there being a level of  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5514) distinction right  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5516) because so you're saying there's a  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5517) difference between unity in a sense  
[1:31:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5519) and uniformity in the sense that we're  
[1:32:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5521) not coming all together and saying okay  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5523) we want to  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5523) we want to basically unite we want to  
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5524) put akai to the south side yeah  
[1:32:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5527) see what i'm saying that has to be used  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5528) there has to be of course that's what it  
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5529) means how can i be calling to the son of  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5531) the messiah  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5532) i'm telling the people the messenger  
[1:32:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5534) said to abdullah ibn abbas  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5537) when you ask ask allah and then the guy  
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5539) next to me it's like a conference we're  
[1:32:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5541) going to talk about  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5542) akida i'm coming yeah  
[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5547) yeah but of course there has to be a  
[1:32:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5548) level of yeah we have to come together  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5550) right this is happening now in the  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5552) schools related to sex education what  
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5554) the  
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5554) kids are being taught and the kophara  
[1:32:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5557) saying okay bring your issues forward  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5558) this and now right and then  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5560) people from different walks of life they  
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5561) all have to come together right and  
[1:32:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5563) they're disgusted  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5566) you see what i'm saying yeah and um  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5569) yeah of course so what do you think of  
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5572) this  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5573) this whole like you were calling it kind  
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5574) of this um  
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5576) phenomena of um  
[1:32:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5579) okay that's the second scenario or the  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5581) second part of the question right  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5583) uh of guilty by association right okay  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5586) and what tends to be thrown around  
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5588) is that statement that is used by the  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5589) salaf  
[1:33:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5595) whoever's bidder is hidden from us then  
[1:33:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5598) his companionship is not hidden do you  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5599) know who said this  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5600) i can't remember now from the top of my  
[1:33:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5602) mind but what i can say to you is  
[1:33:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5604) that a lot of these statements from  
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5608) books like  
[1:33:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5611) right uh i actually have somebody who  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5613) preceded me in saying what i'm going to  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5615) say right now  
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5618) came to birmingham and  
[1:33:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5622) he was asked this question about  
[1:33:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5624) teaching the books like  
[1:33:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5628) because in this book you're going to  
[1:33:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5630) find some very unrestricted statements  
[1:33:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5632) that can be  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5633) totally taken out of context if this is  
[1:33:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5636) now being taught to a revert  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5637) which we've seen happening right and  
[1:34:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5640) you've got same as like if you see  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5642) somebody with an innovator  
[1:34:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5645) then associate with him every type of  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5647) evil  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5648) okay do not sit with the people of  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5650) innovation  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5652) indeed what this is gonna cause is gonna  
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5654) cause sickness to your heart whatever  
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5655) have you  
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5655) okay yes there are right statements they  
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5658) are statements that  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5659) were mentioned by the self we don't deny  
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5660) them but what we need to basically agree  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5663) with is who's an innovator  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5666) when you paint a picture to the people  
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5668) like we are the safe sect right  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5670) and you have this kind of syndrome of i  
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5672) have a green card i'm going to al-jannah  
[1:34:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5674) which we can maybe even touch on in a  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5675) moment  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5676) uh okay and a person begins to think  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5679) halas  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5680) i'm so it and he begins to forget about  
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5682) allah doing righteous actions  
[1:34:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5685) just because you've called yourself a  
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5686) selfie or you've adopted that type of  
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5689) way of thinking that doesn't give you a  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5690) green  
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5692) card to enter into agenda okay and these  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5695) statements to be clear they're not  
[1:34:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5696) judging the religion they're not  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5697) exactly even we were discussing earlier  
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5699) when we were discussing  
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5701) uh this issue that is discussing  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5704) right is the same of the sahabi in  
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5707) within yourself  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5712) it's weak honey for those who actually  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5714) say we don't  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5716) this issue that is discussed in books  
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5717) like rhodoton nader and  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5719) other books of the sulfur it's not  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5722) discussion  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5722) by the way um no i mean  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5726) the whole of for  
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5742) so his his cold is not huge in that

[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5745) team you mentioned i think it's  
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5746) important that i mention this here  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5748) and he's going to brought perspective on  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5750) his book right look what  
[1:35:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5751) uh humilitamia mentioned right and  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5754) hypnotamia  
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5756) don't put him in the same bracket as any  
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5758) other scholar who came after him  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5760) and i'm talking about those who are  
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5762) breathing here today  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5764) okay um ibn as imam and habibi said  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5767) about him  
[1:36:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5774) he has in-depth understanding when it  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5776) comes to knowing the positions  
[1:36:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5778) of the companions and also the targeting  
[1:36:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5781) they have been saying this right  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5796) many of the answers that imam rahim  
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5799) allah gave  
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5800) and those that are like him with regards  
[1:36:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5803) to these issues that we're speaking  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5804) about right  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5806) it came as an answer while  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5809) the questioner when he was asked in this  
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5811) question the one being asked the  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5813) question like for example  
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5814) muhammad he already knew who was talking  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5816) about for example  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5818) in layman's terms right so the viewer  
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5820) understands like when i was in eleanor  
[1:37:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5822) in damage  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5825) everybody was on the same page there  
[1:37:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5826) everybody was

[1:37:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5830) way of thinking right  
[1:37:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5833) it's like a whole village imagine like a  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5834) whole village nobody has a different  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5837) uh creed of view than yourself  
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5841) so you have a teacher that's sitting on  
[1:37:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5843) the chair everybody's attending the  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5844) class you sometimes used to have like  
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5846) five thousand six thousand people  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5848) attending one class after asset and then  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5850) after marketing saying because all the  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5851) um the uh the the  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5854) the the kaki and the shops have to close  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5856) down at the time of the lesson  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5859) so he's asked a question okay  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5862) and what has he been asked about an  
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5864) innovator now that has walked into the  
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5867) everybody knows that this person is a  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5869) innovator the shaykh is being asked a  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5871) very general question  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5873) what do you say about an individual who  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5876) sits with  
[1:37:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5877) the innovator everybody knows what the  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5881) shaykh  
[1:38:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5882) is speaking about or what the question  
[1:38:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5883) is speaking about  
[1:38:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5885) so a lot of these answers that are found  
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5888) in books like  
[1:38:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5892) it was the result of an answer being  
[1:38:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5895) given  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5896) after a question like this was asked so  
[1:38:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5899) one wants to now read this book  
[1:38:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5901) it's translated to him even the person  
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5903) who might be teaching he doesn't know  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5904) arabic himself  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5906) so he's now translating it  
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5909) communicating this to all of these  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5911) attendees some of them are reversed they  
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5913) walk out of the masjid  
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5915) on the streets of the uk oh you're an  
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5917) innovator i can't sit with you  
[1:38:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5919) he was giving him salams before when in  
[1:38:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5921) fact that person he's just like a  
[1:38:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5923) general person he stays away from it  
[1:38:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5925) his own family members he stays away  
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5927) from him mom and dad mom and dad  
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5929) husband told these stories when he came  
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5933) to  
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5934) uh when he came to luton how a wife  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5937) boycotted a husband  
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5939) because of some of these internal selfie  
[1:39:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5942) type issues  
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5944) or that which is ascribed back to you  
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5946) see what i'm saying  
[1:39:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5947) which is of course it's insane it's  
[1:39:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5950) absolutely insane  
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5951) and i believe this kind of way has  
[1:39:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5953) really tarnished  
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5955) the tao of silvia in general okay  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5958) we know when we say salafi it means  
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5961) quran sunnah upon the understanding  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5963) of the early generations collectively  
[1:39:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5966) not ahad  
[1:39:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5966) right because the messenger says  
[1:39:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5971) the best of these who came out and those  
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5973) who came after them  
[1:39:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5975) so to look at salafia today okay  
[1:39:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5980) and basically paint it with one brush  
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5982) because you've run  
[1:39:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5983) into a certain group of brothers well i  
[1:39:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5986) again it's totally unjust  
[1:39:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5989) am i wrong for saying that right you've  
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5991) run into a bunch of brothers  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5992) who were rough and tough and all you  
[1:39:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5995) ever heard from them was  
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5996) them ripping into the people okay even  
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=5999) ripping into their own brothers who  
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6001) might be calling to the same thing  
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6002) just because they're not calling to  
[1:40:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6004) allah under your banner you've started  
[1:40:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6005) having a go at them  
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6006) you know it's like ibra josie is sitting  
[1:40:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6010) with us right now right and seeing  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6013) what's happening around  
[1:40:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6014) us in the uk he mentioned something very  
[1:40:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6016) powerful he said  
[1:40:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6020) hadith  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6027) upon the people of hadith  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6030) is them insulting and criticizing one  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6033) another  
[1:40:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6034) and what are they trying to do here  
[1:40:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6035) they're trying to  
[1:40:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6037) uh what's the best way to put this  
[1:40:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6040) they rejoice over the downfall of others  
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6044) and this is all under the banner he says  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6052) yeah and they do this under the banner  
[1:40:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6054) of  
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6056) and we hear about this all the time  
[1:40:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6057) right this is a science that is studied  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6059) in  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6059) hadith where uh the scholars of the past  
[1:41:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6062) like imam bukhari  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6064) they would criticize the narrators in  
[1:41:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6066) order to protect the sharia  
[1:41:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6067) so the same thing with the uh yeah so he  
[1:41:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6076) says  
[1:41:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6078) what the scholars of the past they use  
[1:41:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6080) this field that they use in order to  
[1:41:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6081) protect the sharia  
[1:41:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6083) you see what i'm saying so he's like i  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6086) heard something  
[1:41:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6087) actually he was saying that people that  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6089) do this that these are two separate  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6091) fields that you shouldn't  
[1:41:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6092) you shouldn't impose  
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6096) a field yeah for that again warning the  
[1:41:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6099) people  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6100) from innovation again is something that  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6102) the religion caused right  
[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6104) but you go to certain gatherings  
[1:41:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6107) it's as if they have their own exactly  
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6112) it has all the names in there 50 guys  
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6114) are here being thrown onto the floor  
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6116) they're being you know thrown under the  
[1:41:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6117) rug this person's offered this person's  
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6119) offer this person's office and this is  
[1:42:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6120) okay again let me  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6121) cancel straight let me let me make this  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6123) very clear  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6125) warning is bidder and it's people i  
[1:42:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6126) mentioned all the courses  
[1:42:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6128) is part of our religion yes you do it  
[1:42:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6130) with the atheist you do it with others  
[1:42:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6132) as well  
[1:42:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6132) we do it as what is part of our religion  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6135) right but  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6136) he has to be done in a fair way it has  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6138) to be it has to be done by the right  
[1:42:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6139) people not someone else  
[1:42:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6140) arabic language and doesn't know how to  
[1:42:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6143) communicate or read or  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6144) right when he when he said they they do  
[1:42:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6147) it under the banner  
[1:42:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6148) of al-jar i didn't ask myself the  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6149) question is you're looking at what's  
[1:42:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6151) happening in the uk  
[1:42:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6153) see what i'm saying he's passed away how  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6154) many hundred years ago  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6156) but too many of these brothers maybe  
[1:42:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6157) even jealousy be of the manager huh  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6160) i mean  
[1:42:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6174) one thing that um  
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6177) he opened my eyes up to is the books of  
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6180) umitamia  
[1:43:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6181) because when i first came back from  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6182) damage i was given a very hard time  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6185) very hard time so much so  
[1:43:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6188) and in fact i can actually relate to  
[1:43:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6190) what yasser is saying at the beginning  
[1:43:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6191) of your podcast when  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6192) he talks about some of the difficulties  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6195) and issues that he went through right  
[1:43:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6196) i can fully relate to that i've seen it  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6198) medina maybe this is something we're  
[1:43:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6199) going to discuss  
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6200) the amount of trouble i've been given in  
[1:43:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6202) the last four years just being in medina  
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6203) so when i left after spending time in in  
[1:43:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6205) aliyaman and i came back  
[1:43:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6206) i was given a very hard time so much so  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6210) that i began to think is this what dean  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6213) of allah azzawajal is  
[1:43:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6215) when i ran into some of these brothers  
[1:43:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6216) the way they were treating me  
[1:43:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6218) and this was being used under the banner  
[1:43:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6220) of as salivir  
[1:43:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6221) this is the way of the self as salafi is  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6224) this  
[1:43:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6226) is a noble thing it's not what i think  
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6228) or what you think muhammad or what my  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6230) sheikh thinks or your  
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6232) it is the way of the three golden  
[1:43:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6233) generations  
[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6235) you see what i'm saying they're  
[1:43:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6236) understanding collectively  
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6238) until actually they met the likes of  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6239) shahrukh bhusam  
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6242) and also abraham's naveed and later on i  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6244) ended up meeting  
[1:44:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6247) and the common feature amongst us all is  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6248) that we were oppressed by the same group  
[1:44:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6250) of people  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6251) and we were made to look that  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6255) this what we're doing is against the way  
[1:44:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6256) of the self even if you  
[1:44:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6258) repent or retract yes it's not all of  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6260) that stuff you're not good enough  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6264) what happened was the man hasn't said to  
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6266) me  
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6267) open your eyes up to the books of him  
[1:44:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6271) so one thing he said to me was he was in  
[1:44:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6274) the house of one of these mashach  
[1:44:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6278) i mentioned just maybe i shouldn't  
[1:44:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6282) yeah huh you don't have to yeah just  
[1:44:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6283) let's just leave inshallah it's one of  
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6284) the prominent  
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6286) of them right and he said to him sheikh  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6288) look  
[1:44:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6289) i have these statements of humanitamia  
[1:44:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6292) like where am i going wrong ibn  
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6294) is saying this about boycotting  
[1:44:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6298) the exact wording that he uses right  
[1:44:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6299) that it depends you can't just boycott  
[1:45:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6301) everybody  
[1:45:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6303) and all the other statements that he  
[1:45:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6304) collected  
[1:45:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6311) has gone against the unanimous agreement  
[1:45:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6316) and i i found that shocking i struggled  
[1:45:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6319) to really believe that  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6320) i later on had discussions with some of  
[1:45:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6322) our mashaykh in damage  
[1:45:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6324) i've went to shariat okay one of the  
[1:45:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6326) things that i get criticized for being  
[1:45:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6328) with shariah  
[1:45:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6332) i spent four years in yemen right and i  
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6334) took to him i was like  
[1:45:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6337) i don't need to discuss now on camera  
[1:45:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6339) what exactly i discussed this is  
[1:45:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6340) a timid a student going up to  
[1:45:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6344) saying what about this and what about  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6345) this what about that how do we deal with  
[1:45:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6348) these issues of pictures and whatnot  
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6349) that  
[1:45:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6350) and these you know and then  
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6355) yeah i i just never after i left and i  
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6359) started opening my eyes up to him  
[1:46:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6362) [Music]  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6364) i just i just like this doesn't make  
[1:46:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6365) sense  
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6367) this is not a productive way of dealing  
[1:46:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6371) with problems of the people  
[1:46:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6375) and of course it's more safer to take  
[1:46:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6379) the position of the scholars of the past  
[1:46:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6384) the one who's living he's not free from  
[1:46:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6386) any fitness so we have the classical  
[1:46:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6388) scholars all saying this  
[1:46:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6390) it's like they're living amongst us  
[1:46:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6394) today they've dealt with our problems  
[1:46:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6396) with how to deal with these issues right  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6398) and i think that's more than sufficient  
[1:46:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6401) yeah how what would you say now probably  
[1:46:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6403) as a final statement to  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6406) about all of the things obviously you're  
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6409) one of the people  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6410) who you're very close to although very  
[1:46:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6412) close to  
[1:46:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6415) and you're very close to some of these  
[1:46:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6416) brothers um  
[1:46:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6418) uh and i think they respect and love you  
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6419) and i think you feel the same way  
[1:47:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6421) yeah with them as well yeah and uh more  
[1:47:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6423) so i still work with  
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6424) knowledge colleges of course i just  
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6426) literally finished now what kind of  
[1:47:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6428) uh what collectively you've come to the  
[1:47:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6431) conclude first of all individually you  
[1:47:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6432) came to the conclusion that you know the  
[1:47:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6434) the kind of stunts you took with that  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6436) shiite incident with  
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6438) uh it was an oppressive one and the tip  
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6440) of the hour was not a good  
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6441) idea and but maybe we should calm down a  
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6443) bit with tempting out what  
[1:47:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6444) would you think that um would sway  
[1:47:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6448) the other brothers to come to a similar  
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6450) conclusion to you  
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6452) okay like i mentioned aziz  
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6456) sometimes you gotta put your emotions to  
[1:47:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6458) the side past incidents to the side  
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6461) and just think about your let me mention  
[1:47:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6463) this narration  
[1:47:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6468) of course he was the hadith of the  
[1:47:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6469) muslims right a man came up to him yes  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6477) he came to complain about somebody  
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6478) oppressed him you know  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6481) he said to him  
[1:48:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6494) himself when he's free but you come to  
[1:48:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6497) him when he becomes busy with the  
[1:48:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6498) affairs of the muslims  
[1:48:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6501) he took a whip  
[1:48:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6505) it's like you know one thing that you  
[1:48:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6507) lash people with right  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6511) the man ended up leaving the place while  
[1:48:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6513) he was upset  
[1:48:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6517) you know the type of individual he was  
[1:48:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6520) who would always you know hold himself  
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6521) to account he's the one that said  
[1:48:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6525) hold yourself to account before that day  
[1:48:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6526) comes your health to account  
[1:48:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6528) he contemplated upon what he done and he  
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6531) asked  
[1:48:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6533) somebody to bring that man again when he  
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6535) was brought  
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6536) he gave him the whip goes with me  
[1:49:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6542) and the man said no  
[1:49:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6548) i've left my right with allah  
[1:49:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6551) and i've left it with you um i said no  
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6554) choose one of the two  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6556) because okay no worries i'm going to  
[1:49:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6557) leave with allah  
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6560) and then the man left omar was so upset  
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6563) was so down he walked into his house  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6567) prayed to raqqa't and then he just burst  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6569) into tears  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6571) and he said these very beautiful  
[1:49:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6572) statements about himself he said  
[1:49:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6578) he was very low and allah  
[1:50:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6604) a man came to you in order to seek your  
[1:50:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6606) assistance right  
[1:50:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6607) instead of helping him you end up  
[1:50:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6610) oppressing him  
[1:50:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6616) what are you going to say to your lord  
[1:50:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6617) when you come to him tomorrow  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6619) yeah so i think  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6623) we as muslims forget about the dua just  
[1:50:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6625) as muslims  
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6626) we need to have this constant habit of  
[1:50:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6628) before we go to sleep  
[1:50:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6630) we just think about everything that we  
[1:50:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6631) said okay we forget what we said  
[1:50:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6634) tomorrow what we said yesterday  
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6637) like this constant habit of before i go  
[1:50:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6639) to sleep i just think about i take a  
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6641) moment or two out close my eyes  
[1:50:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6643) everything that we that i said right  
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6645) that which i said about so and so that  
[1:50:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6647) which i said about  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6648) this individual because he's all gonna  
[1:50:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6652) uh come you know something also that i  
[1:50:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6653) read in sierra leone  
[1:50:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6655) al-asma i mentioned is that also sophia  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6658) and authority and tooth  
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6662) he wrote in his will that his books are  
[1:51:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6664) to be buried  
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6672) omin he regretted some of the things  
[1:51:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6675) that he said about  
[1:51:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6676) others inside of this book he wrote  
[1:51:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6683) what he said about this person what he  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6684) said about that person but  
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6686) look at his humility he was  
[1:51:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6690) um down to earth and humble enough to  
[1:51:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6693) just admit a mistake  
[1:51:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6695) okay i remember what you call it john  
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6698) asked me this question  
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6698) do you believe that you have changed  
[1:51:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6700) when you went to medina  
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6702) i don't necessarily think i could call  
[1:51:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6703) it change it's just maybe more so  
[1:51:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6705) when you sit around the scholars  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6709) and you see the way they  
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6713) just how can i put this in a very nice  
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6714) way where  
[1:51:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6716) they just really just lighten down  
[1:51:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6718) something that is very  
[1:52:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6720) huge upon the next the soul of a person  
[1:52:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6723) for example now  
[1:52:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6724) retracting is not an easy thing right  
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6727) this thing that i'm doing i've been  
[1:52:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6729) thinking about it for so long  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6733) for the last four years it was brought  
[1:52:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6734) to my attention i've been thinking about  
[1:52:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6735) even more so in the last two years  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6737) and even more so in the last month  
[1:52:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6740) yeah it's not an easy thing these  
[1:52:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6743) brothers are very beloved to you and  
[1:52:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6744) sometimes to say  
[1:52:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6745) something that might be a negative light  
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6748) it can be very difficult  
[1:52:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6750) and i really really really hope that  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6753) whatever mentioned doesn't happen to us  
[1:52:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6756) when he said  
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6762) when the people they start cooperating  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6764) in sin and evil they will begin to hate  
[1:52:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6765) one another  
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6768) okay and like when you see some of these  
[1:52:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6771) like let me give you guys an example of  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6776) a medina  
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6780) the six books of hadith in like 28 years  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6782) if i'm not mistaken but don't quote me  
[1:53:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6783) on the years  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6785) and he's then when started teaching the  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6787) books again  
[1:53:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6788) he's maybe in his early 90s or late 80s  
[1:53:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6791) you can just quickly do a google check  
[1:53:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6792) and you'll find this right  
[1:53:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6795) how many times have i heard him say this  
[1:53:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6798) the hectic  
[1:53:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6800) he is like the scholar of the scholars  
[1:53:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6802) in the haram  
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6805) how many times have i heard him say  
[1:53:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6807) allah  
[1:53:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6810) and i don't even study with him the only  
[1:53:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6812) time i've studied with him was  
[1:53:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6813) like i finished the book with him  
[1:53:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6817) this was recently when he taught it  
[1:53:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6819) before he started teaching the  
[1:53:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6821) malik how do i know this sometimes when  
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6824) i leave my halakhah i just basically  
[1:53:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6826) stand there  
[1:53:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6827) and i'm listening to the q and a's he  
[1:53:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6830) says  
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6833) and sometimes he would even give a fatwa  
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6835) and he retracted later on  
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6837) like one of the towers that he recently  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6838) gave regards to the coronavirus  
[1:54:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6840) about you know how you pray in the haram  
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6842) they praying well there's a distance  
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6843) between each masali  
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6845) huh he gave the fat when he said this is  
[1:54:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6847) no that you can't do this  
[1:54:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6850) and then later on when the legend spoke  
[1:54:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6851) about it he retracted his statement  
[1:54:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6856) somebody was very dear to my heart right  
[1:54:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6859) and i'm just giving you guys a couple of  
[1:54:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6860) examples of some of these mountains  
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6862) today who are teaching in the most  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6864) honorable place in the world obviously  
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6866) you have the cabin you have the medina  
[1:54:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6867) as all  
[1:54:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6868) huh there was a class  
[1:54:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6872) where he was teaching us uh just after  
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6875) maghrib  
[1:54:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6876) he was quoting the verses and he was  
[1:54:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6878) trying to make a point about toheidan  
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6887) he mentioned that right then he  
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6889) mentioned the other ayah that's just on  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6891) the next page  
[1:54:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6892) when allah said  
[1:54:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6897) that's basically the ayah right  
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6902) when he mentioned the ayah i've never  
[1:55:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6906) had the ayah before  
[1:55:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6908) he mentioned it in a way that is not in  
[1:55:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6910) the quran  
[1:55:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6923) it was very unintentional it happens to  
[1:55:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6925) us sometimes we might misquote an ayah  
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6927) right  
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6928) i'm sitting in the class i'm actually  
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6930) like suspecting myself did you remember  
[1:55:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6932) did you even remember  
[1:55:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6934) i'm asking myself  
[1:55:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6938) next lesson after obviously saying  
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6943) because yesterday i made a mistake i was  
[1:55:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6944) trying to quote an eye but i completely  
[1:55:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6946) misquoted it  
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6949) when you think about it is this actually  
[1:55:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6952) really difficult for them i don't  
[1:55:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6953) believe it's difficult for them  
[1:55:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6955) when you come to realization that those  
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6957) who are far greater than you  
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6959) from the look look at the look  
[1:56:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6964) was not like any other companion i'm  
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6965) going to conclude with this right  
[1:56:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6970) he was the top when it comes to the  
[1:56:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6971) hadith he memorized even have  
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6988) doesn't ring a bell to most people but  
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6990) you say  
[1:56:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6992) everybody knows him the sunnis know him  
[1:56:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6994) the shiites know him as all  
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6995) and they've got their observations on  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=6997) this great wonderful companion right  
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7000) even harry one of them companions that  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7002) didn't memorize  
[1:56:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7004) anywhere near what they did he came up  
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7007) to him and he said to him  
[1:56:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7008) oh you made a mistake used to give  
[1:56:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7012) the fats with that if the adana fajr  
[1:56:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7016) goes off  
[1:56:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7017) right and you're in the state of janaba  
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7019) whether it was because of relations or  
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7020) whether you were  
[1:57:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7022) you had the wet dream you can't fast  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7023) that day and he gave the sweater for a  
[1:57:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7025) very long time  
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7027) until abdu's came  
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7032) both of them saying that  
[1:57:16](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7036) what you're saying is incorrect they're  
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7038) basically saying the opposite  
[1:57:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7040) look at his response he didn't turn  
[1:57:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7042) around and say  
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7044) like i am i am i've memorized x amount  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7047) of a hadith  
[1:57:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7050) did they really say this  
[1:57:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7055) if that is the case they are more  
[1:57:36](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7056) knowledgeable than me forgot this issue  
[1:57:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7058) and he retracted his statement even  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7061) faith suggests and recently retracted  
[1:57:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7063) some things that he mentioned with  
[1:57:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7064) regards to this whole corona virus  
[1:57:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7070) so um it's important you know we  
[1:57:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7075) just kind of like accept it we swallow  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7078) the ego  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7078) and we bite our tongues and just you  
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7081) know  
[1:58:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7082) and and what you did basically in the  
[1:58:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7085) video is always it's very highly  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7086) respectable  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7088) you know and uh  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7091) when you basically said that you said he  
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7093) was mistaken  
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7094) it takes a man to do that right i've  
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7097) done that i've  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7098) i've had so many retractions brother you  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7100) know  
[1:58:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7102) that's yeah that's because it's like and  
[1:58:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7104) and the other thing is and i think it's  
[1:58:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7105) important that we discuss this is  
[1:58:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7107) by the way it disarms people as well  
[1:58:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7108) like when you  
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7110) when you've made a mistake and it's  
[1:58:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7111) clear for the majority to see at least  
[1:58:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7113) yeah  
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7114) and it's a mistake you know i've made  
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7117) many of them  
[1:58:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7118) as you as people know like uh i've made  
[1:58:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7121) videos about my mistakes  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7122) muhammad hijab exposed i made a couple  
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7124) of videos okay i've never watched them  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7131) so but i was going to say is that yeah  
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7135) it's just to sums people because  
[1:58:57](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7137) you want your record to be clean as  
[1:58:59](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7139) possible and you know you're going to be  
[1:59:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7140) making mistakes especially at a young  
[1:59:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7142) age you know you're going to be making  
[1:59:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7143) mistakes so  
[1:59:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7143) what's the what's the fuss about you can  
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7146) just get out of the way and  
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7147) kind of move on yeah it's it's something  
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7150) that universally happens with everybody  
[1:59:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7165) you you seek more knowledge even if you  
[1:59:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7167) tell me he said  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7171) the more you increase knowledge you  
[1:59:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7172) become more merciful right that's  
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7174) beautiful  
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7174) yeah and um you really tend to think  
[1:59:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7178) about things more and  
[1:59:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7180) and and there's no harm you make  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7182) mistakes even  
[1:59:43](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7183) says to me all the time that he made you  
[1:59:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7186) know he used to say things like  
[1:59:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7188) telling everybody that you have to all  
[1:59:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7190) make hijra jiben  
[1:59:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7191) as soon as they came back and all of  
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7193) them they were on it  
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7194) but then you kind of like the more you  
[1:59:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7196) give the hour you kind of mature  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7198) through it and yeah and when you when  
[2:00:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7200) you see some of your elders saying this  
[2:00:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7202) is yeah see what i'm saying yeah and  
[2:00:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7205) things also very very important that we  
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7206) touch on this is  
[2:00:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7208) just because i take a view it's not fair  
[2:00:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7211) that my brother who i may have been  
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7214) seen with yeah okay is painted with the

[2:00:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7221) obviously this is exactly what's  
[2:00:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7222) happened now i never meet him there  
[2:00:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7225) and now i've been seeing and i totally  
[2:00:27](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7227) understand why person would think that

[2:01:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7269) thought about it and it was one of the  
[2:01:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7271) things that

[2:01:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7283) i don't think i'm the type of person who  
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7284) enforces his views  
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7286) i have this rough and tough what you  
[2:01:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7288) call it mentality if you don't take my  
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7290) view  
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7290) i'm gonna throw you off or i'm gonna  
[2:01:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7292) boycott you or whatever have you right  
[2:01:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7294) it's been done to me before somebody  
[2:01:35](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7295) said to me bro if you don't leave this  
[2:01:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7297) i'm gonna boycott you  
[2:01:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7299) okay go do whatever you wanna he like i  
[2:01:41](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7301) never started doing that  
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7302) with you and at the end of the day you  
[2:01:45](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7305) know it's uh  
[2:01:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7307) it's been said to me so i know how he  
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7308) feels and i've seen people's  
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7310) relationships like a teacher student  
[2:01:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7312) relation get a bit frosty as all because  
[2:01:54](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7314) of the pushy roughy type of  
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7318) way that one was trying to get maybe his  
[2:02:01](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7321) message across and i seen it doesn't go  
[2:02:04](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7324) down nicely  
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7325) so my position with everybody is bro  
[2:02:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7327) this is my view  
[2:02:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7330) if you want to take is entirely up to  
[2:02:11](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7331) you okay  
[2:02:14](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7334) and um and i'll just advise a person  
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7337) and because i've advised him now does  
[2:02:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7339) that mean i'm going to boycott i'm going  
[2:02:20](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7340) to stop work doing that with him  
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7343) yeah and some people want that you see  
[2:02:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7345) what i'm saying  
[2:02:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7346) just because you've differed with so and  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7348) so they want you to differ okay i've  
[2:02:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7349) differed with him halas boycotting i  
[2:02:32](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7352) don't think that's a productive way to  
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7353) kind of like  
[2:02:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7354) really go forward as well some people  
[2:02:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7357) have like ultra motives as well and  
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7359) everything yeah and i think  
[2:02:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7360) that that attitude is um especially i'm  
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7362) going to say especially in in the  
[2:02:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7364) muslim community those who attribute  
[2:02:47](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7367) themselves to salafia if they if  
[2:02:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7370) everyone attributed themselves salafiyah  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7372) had this kind of attitude you know well  
[2:02:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7375) i think we'd have  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7376) more productive uh and more  
[2:03:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7380) you know effective tower uh as as a  
[2:03:03](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7383) muslim community as a whole  
[2:03:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7385) and so i wanted to thank you for coming  
[2:03:07](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7387) on to this podcast i think it's been  
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7389) extremely productive and um again let me  
[2:03:12](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7392) just point out before this gets  
[2:03:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7393) misconstrued as all right  
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7395) there is issues that go back to a  
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7398) person's hd head  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7399) yeah okay and there's some issues here  
[2:03:21](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7401) that is  
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7402) credo type matters right and we're not  
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7404) discussing this at the moment we're  
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7405) speaking about  
[2:03:26](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7406) other personalities he had the issues  
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7408) yeah uh  
[2:03:29](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7409) a person like wants to maybe do  
[2:03:31](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7411) something i might disagree with him of  
[2:03:33](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7413) how he goes to do  
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7414) a particular thing just because i don't  
[2:03:37](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7417) agree with him that's why i'm gonna  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7418) boycott him or throw him off you see  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7420) what i'm saying  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7420) and a lot of the time you see that it  
[2:03:42](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7422) goes back to these issues  
[2:03:44](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7424) now you find people calling this an  
[2:03:46](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7426) individual innovator or  
[2:03:48](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7428) this and that tends to come back to  
[2:03:50](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7430) these kind of things isn't it  
[2:03:51](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7431) and i think you're a living example of  
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7433) someone who starts off  
[2:03:55](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7435) with um with a certain kind of approach  
[2:03:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7438) and then  
[2:03:58](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7438) what the more reading the more knowledge  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7440) the more nuanced the more  
[2:04:02](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7442) sophisticated you become for sharing  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7445) your thoughts i think  
[2:04:06](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7446) many of the things you've said people  
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7448) would resonate with and find really  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7450) productive soldiers  
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/ERxMxtTR9eo?t=7453) and uh for those watching insha allah
