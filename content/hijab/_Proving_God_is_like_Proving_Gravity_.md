## Description

An interesting take on how we use inferences to come to conclusions, and how we should be able to do that on matters of theology.

discusses the idea that there is something which is "sophisticated" and "in place," and that this entity may suggest a cause which led to its existence. It goes on to say that this cause is something which is "called the fallacy of incredulity," in which someone doubts something simply because they do not understand it.  then asks a question: what is the purpose of life? After some discussion, it is agreed that everyone has their own purpose, and that it is not important to understand everyone else's purpose.

\**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9u4RAKBI\&t=0)* Discusses the concept of gravity, and how it can be demonstrated through the effects it has on objects. It goes on to say that just because something is given a scientific label, it doesn't mean it's wrong.  then touches on the idea of God, and how people can believe in Him without having any empirical evidence. It finishes by saying that just because something has effects, it doesn't mean it's real.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9u4RAKBI\&t=300)** the creator argues that the same logic we use to understand gravity can be used to understand the universe. He points out that the effects of the universe - such as the existence of life, a finely tuned system, and systems motions consistencies - all point to a cause. He suggests that the cause may be an unknown force called "gravity."
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9u4RAKBI\&t=600)** argues that because we see the effects of gravity and the universe exhibits order law and sophistication, we can infer that God exists.
*   \**[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9u4RAKBI\&t=900)* Discusses the idea that there is something which is "sophisticated" and "in place," and that this entity may suggest a cause which led to its existence.

*   \**[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9u4RAKBI\&t=1200)* Discusses the idea that there is no definitive answer to the question of why humans are here, as it is a question with a lot of different, subjective answers. However, it goes on to say that, even if there is no definitive answer, it is still important to have an objective purpose in life, as it is something that gives us meaning and purpose.

[0:00:03](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=3) something which you can empirically see\
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=5) you can't see it or hear it or feel it\
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=8) or touch it empiricism\
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=10) Mellon I'll tell you what you saw the\
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=13) effects of gravity you didn't see\
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=15) gravity you see what I'm saying so if I\
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=18) were to ask you you believe in gravity\
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=21) but you don't but you have no evidence\
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=23) directly of its existence all you have\
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=25) is evidences of the effects of gravity\
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=28) gravity if I say to you look gravity is\
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=30) actually an angel wait a minute what did\
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=36) you say there Francis you look gravity\
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=39) is not actually gravity gravity is a\
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=42) range of angels drilling down objects on\
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=48) celestial bodies like earth or planets\
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=50) planetary bodies that's what gravity is\
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=52) all in the cosmos\
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=53) so gravity is in fact angels I'm not\
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=57) gonna call it gravity anymore I'm going\
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=59) to call it the angels that pull down\
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=61) objects on planets I have as much of a\
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=65) truth claim a legitimate truth claim as\
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=67) the scientist who's referring to gravity\
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=70) as gravity the only difference is a\
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=72) semantical difference yeah but you're\
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=74) both wrong well both of us no no no I'm\
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=79) not saying look it we're not both wrong\
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=84) both of us let me tell you why we don't\
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=87) yes sorry go ahead by the way that I\
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=94) believe in angels but I'm just saying no\
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=96) no angels there's no angel of gravity in\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=98) this lamp I'm just saying that I'm\
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=99) giving you just an example right if I if\
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=101) I said if and this is a conditional so\
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=104) what I'm saying to you is for you to say\
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=107) it's both from you could say is this\
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=108) unfalsifiable yeah unfalsifiable right\
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=112) to take Pope alien kind of logical\
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=114) understanding is those unfalsifiable\
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=116) just because something is unfalsifiable\
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=118) it doesn't mean it's wrong sure but\
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=121) there's no way really\
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=122) no no science we're not no police your\
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=125) faith nobody else which is I'm not\
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=127) saying that\
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=128) I'm not and I'm not saying that I am NOT\
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=131) making that I'm not working that point\
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=133) bro I'll show them again sorry Darren\
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=136) yeah I'm not saying it's wrong what I'm\
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=138) saying is that I'm just making it I'm\
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=142) not talking about God now I thought it's\
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=143) a confusing discussion no no we're not\
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=146) not whenever you see we just got that\
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=147) Muslim it doesn't mean I'm always going\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=148) to be talking about God but I can't have\
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=150) discussions and other things as well\
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=151) okay I can well I was while I was saying\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=155) - is this the point I was making to you\
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=157) an overarching point was that just\
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=159) because something is given as scientific\
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=162) and I think you agree with this right\
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=163) just because something has given a\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=164) scientific label so I was giving an\
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=166) example of gravity gravity is a pulling\
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=168) force okay or pushing force or whatever\
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=172) you want to call it depending on what\
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=173) theory you want to go with right now\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=176) here's the thing the thing of gravity\
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=178) itself we said can't be empirically\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=180) justified the effects of gravity is\
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=183) obviously so my point was that if I were\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=185) followed to a place toward gravity with\
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=187) gremlins or angels or whatever I'd have\
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=191) as much right to do that from a\
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=192) philosophical perspective as a scientist\
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=202) perfect\
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=206) would you accept we are excellent not\
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=208) food I I would I would say no problem\
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=211) that's very nice but then you've given\
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=214) us a nice premise to start off our\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=215) discussion I'll see a logical discussion\
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=217) because I know you all have to took a\
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=219) while good let me know what's your name\
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=222) again I forgot my Jordan Jordan nice to\
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=224) meet you man are you a religious person\
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=226) or more scientific okay so it's\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=230) perfectly said that right\
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=231) I'm happy you said this because you said\
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=234) that we can understand something through\
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=236) its effects you know there's a beautiful\
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=239) interesting quote of the Arabs one our\
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=242) man he said advisor to tadoule Allah is\
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=247) said that the the entrance all the you\
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=254) can say the entrails of the camel is the\
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=258) camera was there yes yeah you know your\
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=263) property you know whatever it is uh yeah\
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=267) I'll buy to the lobby so hey the point\
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=269) is the effects of something gives us\
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=271) reason to believe of something gravity\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=274) is a perfect example of that you've\
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=275) never seen gravity you've never heard\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=277) gravity empirically you can't\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=279) substantiate gravity you can only see\
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=281) the effects of gravity and I'll say to\
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=282) you the same thing about the the\
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=283) universe now you might have never seen\
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=290) the clothes of the universe we've never\
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=293) seen the cause of the universe but we've\
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=295) seen the effects of it now the point is\
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=298) since we've seen the effect of it can we\
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=300) apply the same logic to the universe as\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=302) we apply to gravity\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=304) remember when I asked you about gravity\
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=306) the first thing you did was you grab\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=307) your bottle and you dropped it you\
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=308) showed me that look these are the\
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=309) effects of gravity now look I'm saying\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=311) the same thing about the universe the\
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=313) effects of the universe or the result of\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=317) a universe is that we have a finely\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=319) tuned system and why they I mean and not\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=324) an aesthetically pleasing I'm talking\
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=326) about a universe which allows for any\
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=329) kind of life to exist\
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=330) that's a finely tuned universe with\
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=333) systems motions consistencies colony\
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=340) synchronization a life time space 3d all\
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=345) of that at the same time halos\
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=354) isn't is another way of saying\
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=357) randomness and randomness doesn't exist\
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=361) randomness is a word human beings use to\
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=367) describe that which they don't\
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=368) understand so here just because and\
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=373) that's this is called the argument from\
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=375) ignorance it's a very classical logical\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=378) fallacy just because you don't\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=378) understand something you don't assign\
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=381) the black hole you don't understand the\
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=383) problem of evil it doesn't mean that\
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=385) this result is that this thing is\
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=387) falsified no that's the gap of the god\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=394) of the gaps argument but you can say the\
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=396) same thing of science you have the\
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=398) science of the gaps removed to say yeah\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=400) so the point I'm making dick in the step\
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=402) back here the question is we have the\
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=405) effect which is the universe what is the\
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=407) cause of this universe if we agree with\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=414) if we if we agree with a cause and\
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=417) effect the premise so if we choose one\
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=425) of them that you're convinced on fire\
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=434) the Big Bang\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=438) I mean I will say I don't know what\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=440) caused it universe and I don't know if I\
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=444) could even comprehend it how do you know\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=448) that gravity is either a pulling or\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=452) pushing force how do you know that\
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=453) because the two series that we have\
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=455) really Newtonian / Einstein Yin is\
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=458) either it's going to be a pulling force\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=459) or pushing force I mean that's the two\
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=461) options you have if it's not really that\
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=464) difficult how do you know that gravity\
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=467) is either a pulling force or a pushing\
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=468) for another so if I have this thing here\
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=477) if you have that it's going to go down\
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=479) it's going to go from an elevated as\
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=480) ascension position to a descended\
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=483) position or a declined position it's not\
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=486) correct and that down downward motion\
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=491) suggests either something is pushing or\
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=493) something is pulling isn't that right I\
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=495) mean I know physics is much more\
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=496) complicated and I'm not a physicist but\
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=499) yeah but it's logical\
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=503) it's relatively a because of the\
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=507) attraction of math no problem\
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=509) I I'm saying how do we come to a\
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=511) conclusion that is either one of those\
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=512) two things but you're using a kind of\
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=519) reductionism physics and logic are\
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=520) inextricably linked physics because the\
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=524) language of physics is mathematics at\
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=526) the end of the day geometry is part of\
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=528) mass and logic is part of like geometry\
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=531) is logical right so from that\
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=533) perspective if we're talking about\
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=536) gravity we're talking something pulling\
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=538) something pushing something compressing\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=540) something like this right now why did we\
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=542) come to that conclusion we came to that\
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=544) conclusion with a deduction a kind of\
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=547) inference to the best sex relation we\
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=549) say okay well look if it's coming down\
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=551) either something is pushing it well\
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=553) something is pulling it now I want you\
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=555) to apply the same exact logic because\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=557) you're 100% sure and I'm 100% sure that\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=559) gravity exists I'm not most of your\
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=563) hundred central you know okay maybe not\
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=565) yourself but that there is a force\
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=567) that's pulling or pushing or creating\
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=569) this kind of movement okay and that they\
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=571) call it in the van in the vernacular the\
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=572) scientific vernacular gravity let's\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=575) apply the same logic to the universe so\
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=579) we have\
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=587) well no look me oh I can conclude that\
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=591) my \[ \_\_ ] drop I'm not really trying to\
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=594) make analogies with their I'm just\
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=595) trying to great we make decisions on a\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=600) daily basis as to what is what so in\
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=602) other words why we believe a certain\
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=604) thing no but not just your - with that\
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=607) but we make deductions on inferences on\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=610) a daily basis right physicists do the\
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=612) same things logicians do the same things\
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=614) that mathematicians do the same thing\
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=615) everyone does in now I'm saying is that\
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=617) the same ways we've come to inferences\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=620) about gravity we can do the same thing\
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=621) about the universe it's not that\
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=622) difficult just because there is a\
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=624) narrative now and I'm gonna use the word\
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=627) but I suppose colonial narrative yeah\
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=632) yeah it is a post-colonial narrative\
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=635) what is a Wilson that not my opinion so\
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=638) what's to notice it right opposed to\
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=639) lighten my narrative yeah what which is\
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=643) which is a postmodern narrative in many\
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=645) ways as well which is pushing us to\
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=647) believe in that atheism there's some\
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=650) kind of alternative see a theistic\
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=652) explanation the big bang or saying that\
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=684) it started\
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=687) spread out think they can think just\
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=691) like just like with them like you said\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=692) with a cop and we're looking at that\
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=694) that's that everybody we have the\
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=697) effects of the cause as well\
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=707) so yep yep they can say we think because\
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=712) of this evidence because of this data\
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=716) that we've collected yes the universe\
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=718) was likely to start this long ago\
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=725) from here and it started from one point\
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=728) like what my premise is today yeah yeah\
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=735) sorry that that is a lot closer to\
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=737) anything no no no I'm a creationist\
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=743) there is a hell of a lot more of an idea\
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=746) than Cameron obtained\
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=753) something that's almost like a like a\
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=756) myth I promise\
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=757) okay well that's interesting you either\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=759) say New Atheists\
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=760) dargon right which maybe you've been\
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=762) affected by because of primary or\
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=764) secondary socialization no problem\
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=766) but while stem assiduous we'll come to\
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=780) that but what I was going to say was\
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=781) that look\
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=781) my premise today is that God is as\
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=785) feasible as gravity that's my premise\
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=788) right ya know what I'm saying to you is\
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=792) that we believe in gravity because we\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=794) see the effects of gravity we believe in\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=796) God because one of the reasons not good\
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=798) the primary reason there are other\
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=800) reasons but one of the reasons from not\
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=802) only a sense datum perspective like\
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=804) inference and using empiricism and\
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=806) cause-and-effect but another perspective\
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=809) which is in the deduction is perspective\
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=810) we can believe in God as a result of the\
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=814) effects of God now you don't need use\
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=816) the word God yeah yeah well I'm not\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=819) witness not use the word God and entity\
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=822) right an entity that created the\
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=825) universe is sustaining the universe\
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=826) maintaining the universe cetera\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=830) let's say the universe what is so what\
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=837) is an effect of\
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=839) like an example\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=842) now what I'm saying is look like the\
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=844) things that the universe exhibits so the\
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=846) universe exhibits order law and order oh\
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=850) really yeah\
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=851) because there are lives lost physics\
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=863) there's gravitational constant says\
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=866) little there's lots of things right one\
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=867) thing not we do know look we know\
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=872) gravity or through its effects right\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=874) well you're confident and so the\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=876) physicists to say that gravity exists\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=878) now the reason why is because we see the\
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=879) effects now I'm saying is the same thing\
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=881) we look at the things that the universe\
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=882) exhibits universe exhibits order law\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=885) universe exhibits sophistication\
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=888) complication now the same thing I'll say\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=890) to you we've used the effects of\
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=893) something to kind of infer the course\
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=895) same thing we could say about the\
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=896) universe the fact that there is a\
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=899) creation sophisticated creation or let's\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=901) not even use the word creation let's use\
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=902) the word sophisticated entity right yeah\
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=905) we did jump sorry I apologize\
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=906) there's something which is sophisticated\
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=908) it's an entity in place the fact that\
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=910) that exists may suggest may suggest yeah\
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=915) or should suggest from an inference\
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=917) perspective that there was a cause which\
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=920) caused that into being now what is that\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=923) cause that's when we start talking about\
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=925) the attributes of the course\
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=926) does it have intelligence does it have\
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=928) knowledge because I have the power into\
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=930) creative capacity to put the universe\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=932) into being because of course because it\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=936) causes the fine\
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=939) because the course is defined as\
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=941) something which brings rise to phenomena\
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=945) is it comprehendible was the course of\
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=949) the course that was that we're talking\
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=950) about the yes can you comprehend it\
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=956) weird some ways of this we know can you\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=959) comprendo right now no but why I'm\
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=968) saying to you is you know grant you know\
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=971) gravity through his effects why can't we\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=973) use the same principle was the universe\
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=983) why it's a part of the universe we can\
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=986) use the analogy of gravity to look at\
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=988) like how we understand\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=996) my father-in-law ran eight\
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1001) a conclusion that we came to with\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1003) gravity is there's something that we\
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1004) don't know we know in effect but we\
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1007) don't know that so it is like a leap of\
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1011) faith to say when we're looking at the\
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1014) universe to find the same thing and\
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1015) there's a little face to say that\
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1016) gravity exists it's the same it's the\
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1019) same leap of faith when you say gravity\
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1021) exists isn't it\
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1022) well you believe you have you ever\
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1023) doubted gravity but I can say gravity\
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1026) exists and also say I don't understand\
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1028) yeah I think yeah no that's no problem\
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1030) now that's a fair point but that is\
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1032) called the fallacy of incredulity you\
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1036) say something is so amazing the fallacy\
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1042) of incredulity is in a form of a logical\
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1043) fallacy which is it's applicable in some\
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1045) cases something is so complicated that I\
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1047) just don't get it but just because you\
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1050) don't understand it doesn't mean it's\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1051) not true we don't need to know the\
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1060) intricacies we know on a fundamental\
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1061) level that is some kind of force\
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1071) like this I like this discussion I mean\
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1076) I like it yeah for sure I think that\
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1089) you're right they're not unimportant\
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1090) details for sure and I think there's a\
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1092) lot of disagreement here in what we're\
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1095) saying and I think what we need to do I\
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1097) want to just I swear to god I'm not\
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1099) doing this on purpose we've had that\
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1100) discussion cause and effect I just wanna\
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1102) say one more thing completely off topic\
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1104) wait a minute why am i changing topic\
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1107) one more thing if you want to say\
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1108) something before you go \[ \_\_ ] man I don't\
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1112) mind but I just want to say one more\
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1113) thing okay I want to ask you I want to\
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1115) throw out there man\
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1116) I do I want to really throw it out there\
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1118) just one thing we talked about cause and\
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1119) effect whatever it's not you've heard my\
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/Nbv9u4RAKBI?t=1122) argument you know it I don't think I you\
