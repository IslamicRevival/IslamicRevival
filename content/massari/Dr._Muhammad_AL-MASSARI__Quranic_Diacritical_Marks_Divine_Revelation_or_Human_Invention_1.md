 discusses the various diacritical marks found in the Quran, and argues that they were either divine revelation or human invention. Two of these marks, fatah yano and the circle on top of the world, were added by later scholars.  also discusses the controversy over whether or not there was a Qur'anic copy written by Muhammad's companions. It argues that the available evidence suggests that there was not, and instead that the copy of the Quran written by Muhammad's companions was a copy of a copy.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=0)** Dr. Muhammad AL-MASSARI discusses the evidence that the Qur'an is a written revelation from God. He points out that there is no other narration in contradiction to this fact, and that it is clear from the wording of the ayah that it was multiple narrations that led to the revelation's compilation into a book. He then discusses the issue of reading the Qur'an, mentioning that some people claim that the Prophet Muhammad could not read. He clarifies that this was not actually the case, and that the Prophet was asked to read something in writing. He goes on to say that even if someone cannot read, they are still able to recite the Qur'an correctly.

* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=600)* Discusses the origins of the Arabic script, which is believed to have been developed either as a result of divine revelation or human invention. It also discusses the origins of punctuation, which was not present in the original writing. Various fragments of the Quran that have been discovered contain no punctuation, which is likely a result of the script being adopted later by someone educated in the form of writing. Finally, the video discusses a document that has been discovered which dates back to the time of the Roman Empire. This document confirms that the Arabic script was developed during this time period.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=900)* Discusses how the arabic letters in the Qur'an were distinguished by the Arabs in Mecca, and how the dots between HA and BA were known and used by the early Muslims. The second hypothesis, that the dots were a revelation from God, is supported by the fact that they are uniform across all versions of the Qur'an and there is no other variation except in a few places. This opens the door to various possible readings, including the idea that the dots were intended to be like modern-day punctuation marks.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=1200)* Discusses the various diacritical marks found in the Quran, and argues that they were either divine revelation or human invention. Two of these marks, fatah yano and the circle on top of the world, were added by later scholars.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=1500)* Discusses the controversy over whether or not there was a Qur'anic copy written by Muhammad's companions. It argues that the available evidence suggests that there was not, and instead that the copy of the Quran written by Muhammad's companions was a copy of a copy.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=1800)* Discusses the origins of the diacritical marks in the Qur'an, which some scholars believe were copied from earlier scripture. It also discusses the possibility that the Prophet Muhammad was aware of this, and may have avoided or ordered them not to be included in the Qur'an intentionally to make it appear as a miraculous product of divine revelation.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=2100)* Discusses how punctuation in the Quran can be either understood rationally or as divine revelation. notes that there is no rational explanation for why some letters were omitted, and that this is evidence in support of the divine origin of the Quran.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAMIgyQ7QWk&t=2400)**  Dr. Muhammad AL-MASSARI discusses the Quranic diacritical marks and their origins. He notes that the marks are different in different parts of the world and that they were likely invented by humans. He goes on to say that despite their origins being human-made, they still make sense and can be seen as a product of divine revelation.

[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=49) eschatology as an amusement or as  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=51) entertainment most likely his is making  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=53) like i didn't see the video  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=56) maybe he's mocking it all in a mild way  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=58) because yuba lush is a little bit  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=60) classical  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=61) which is good it's not bad that to be  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=64) not to be very uh  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=66) very harsh in mocking and so on but from  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=68) the title it's clear that he regard the  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=70) he most likely is commenting  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=73) on the god is just as infant there and  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=74) nobody should take it more seriously  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=76) than that or something but i didn't see  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=78) maybe you should check in youtube so  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=80) islamic eschatology as entertainment  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=84) yeah i mean i  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=91) you know obviously i can't we can't  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=93) comment on unless we know exactly what's  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=95) being said what did you say  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=97) i can't find the original source here he  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=99) was very what did he say  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=101) that's what i'm trying to say i don't  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=102) know exactly what he said what people  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=104) are saying is you know the  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=105) the harappa is not divine as in he has  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=108) some  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=109) allegedly he has some issue with what is  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=112) what is not divine  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=113) so the the the  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=116) and you know the recitation it appears  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=118) in terms of  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=120) you know the how you recite the quran  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=122) these mechanisms or how you've assembled  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=124) so basically he put doubt in the  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=133) we discussed that at the beginning but i  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=135) did not stress it maybe at the festival  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=137) maybe we should have an intervening  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=139) halacha in this issue maybe we'll do  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=140) this helicopter this way today  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=142) it is uh since we are recording we shall  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=144) go ahead with that okay first of all uh  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=148) i think i hinted that maybe i did not  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=150) see it very sharply and and and  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=153) offensively let us say  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=155) in the first half or the first few  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=156) halaquahs which we discuss the  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=158) recordation of the quran  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=159) is the quran is  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=161) as  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=162) uh is a written revelation  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=165) and the evidence for that is clear it is  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=167) uh  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=174) tablet is usually where you write things  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=177) and also the first revelation which is  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=180) obviously these are hadith i don't think  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=182) if they are muted water but it seems to  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=183) be there is no other narration which is  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=185) contradicting that  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=187) which is also corroborated with the  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=189) first revelation which is the first few  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=191) eyes of surat  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=196) and that one came the first time  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=198) uh he  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=199) he  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=200) showed the messenger  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=204) a parchment or a sahifa or a scroll or  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=207) whatever it is something in which  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=208) something is written  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=209) and ask him read so he's pointing  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=212) something written  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=214) yeah  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=215) read  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=216) he did not prompt him said he read  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=218) something i say repeat after me or  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=220) do recite  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=222) otherwise if i tell you i said this for  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=225) say subhanallah will say then you say  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=227) then it will be saved not read  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=229) so he offered something in writing read  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=232) and the messenger said i'm not a reader  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=234) i'm a letter i can't read  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=236) and then he squishes squeeze him as  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=238) relation goes and said read  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=241) and the third time and then he said then  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=245) was shivering of fear and we know that  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=248) the rest of the story  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=251) two comments  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=252) this is clear from this and also the  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=254) wording of the ayah so i say this is a  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=256) hadith and there's no other narration  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=258) except this one i think it's multiple  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=259) narration but at the area correctly that  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=262) it was it collapsed  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=266) read meaning foreign something which is  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=268) written in front of you  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=270) and also the answer i am not a reader  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=273) i am a literate i can't read anything i  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=275) have not learned reading or writing so  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=278) i'm going to read something you show me  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=279) a punishment it has crippled i don't  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=281) understand anything of it  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=283) so that's it it's definitely a written  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=285) revelation that's the fundamental one  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=287) that's number one let me make a small  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=289) comment  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=290) i think i made it india but let me  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=292) repeat it again here just for the  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=293) benefit of english listener non-muslims  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=295) and so on some egyptian christians say  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=298) look how how how gentle the angels were  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=301) broadcasting the news to mariam about  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=304) the the  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=305) the conception of nissan so on  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=308) in his gentle way as well muhammad was  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=310) treated harshly by  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=311) jibril which indicated that must have  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=313) been uh must have been some kind of a  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=315) shaytan or a devil or something like  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=317) that can't be look at the difference but  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=319) uh i just wanted to make a small comment  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=321) on that this is this is utter stupidity  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=323) because  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=324) uh mariam was giving a good news of  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=326) conceiving a man of superior qualities  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=330) barely available anyone in mankind like  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=332) himself that's alisa that's a good news  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=334) there's something to be jubilant about  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=336) that and also the repercussions at least  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=338) in the first phase will be very great  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=340) becoming pregnant with them we get  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=342) married all of these things so we have  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=343) to give a gentle and nice independence  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=346) with sabrina who said that to someone  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=347) else  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=348) but in the case gabriel himself when he  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=350) comes to the message to the messengers  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=352) he come always partially the place which  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=355) is in the old testament where he comes  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=356) to  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=358) someone in a harsh way is  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=360) go to the book of daniel you have an  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=362) english one differently in front of you  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=364) or at home go and read the whole thing  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=367) usually he comes in you know shocking  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=369) and harsh in harsh way this is the way  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=371) he usually comes  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=373) in the very house in shocking way even  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=375) daniel fell in his face out of fear so  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=378) just a small answer to this this  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=380) question please  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=381) wake up to the realities you don't know  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=383) what you're talking about that's all  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=385) what i'm saying  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=386) just as i remember  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=388) i am now today in a good mood  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=390) i can do a bit of jokes  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=392) so that's no no that's the real comes  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=394) from here and the reason for that  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=396) we don't know this is just let me say  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=398) this is a hypothesis which is a mystic  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=401) nature you feel that in your heart but  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=402) you don't have really a full russian  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=404) argument is that the way he comes this  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=407) way in a shockingly shaking way is that  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=409) the recipient will be shaken to his core  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=413) and  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=413) he cannot say this has must have been  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=416) just just a fleeting thought or  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=418) something that must be a very harsh  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=420) reality my heart is beating up i'm  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=423) shivering i'm running away and so on it  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=425) is a reality it is not something  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=427) something really extended  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=429) shaking internally if you have a bad  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=431) thought you get depressed you have a  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=433) fleeting thought you have maybe daydream  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=435) but it doesn't come like that that way  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=438) yeah  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=438) so that may be one of the reasons there  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=440) are many other reasons it make a better  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=442) impression on the mind and give you  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=444) better uh  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=445) a better better  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=447) self perception or internal perception  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=450) that this is a really external reality  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=452) it's not your subconscious usually  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=454) subconscious only in nightmares when you  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=456) are sleeping  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=457) but not otherwise  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=460) it comes in in in that comes in that  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=462) message comes we know the way you feel  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=464) you are squeezed you feel someone is  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=466) killing you you feel your head is cut  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=468) but nobody come and give you a passion  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=470) to say read and do this and tell you  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=472) some some sensible words or something  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=475) instruction that's not the way nightmare  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=477) works nice america there is something  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=478) terrifying you feel you are choking you  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=480) feel out burning you feel someone has  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=483) cut your legs you know you have  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=485) experience nice nice so this way the way  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=487) you really come so the recipient to  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=489) recognize this must be absolutely from  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=491) outside must be from some other source  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=493) let me verify what is the source  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=495) in the case of daniel is himself a  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=497) prophet already and he has been elected  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=499) as a prophet before that  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=501) so he knows this is that angel  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=503) in the case muhammad is not a prophet he  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=505) has to verify it by self  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=507) reflection and also by  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=509) by discussing with khadija and obama  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=512) achieving the highest level of certitude  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=514) you can achieve which is both  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=516) internal perception with external  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=519) rational verification ah just leave that  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=521) point the secondary let's go to the  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=523) fundamental point  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=525) now this is clear that it has been shown  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=527) a punishment and also the quran says  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=529) we call it kitab kitab is something  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=531) written  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=540) what is the exact meaning of that but  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=542) it's clearly hinting it's something  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=543) written and there are many narrations  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=546) that is in heaven and so on that's  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=549) maybe metaphorical we don't know so the  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=551) original revelation is a written  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=553) revelation  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=555) now someone say  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=557) the revelation came to an illiterate man  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=560) how can he when the quran initially he  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=563) dictated to the people and they write  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=565) according to their  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=566) best skills  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=568) uh which they have which is a  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=570) the so-called hijaz script  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=573) uh at the time of  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=574) makkah  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=577) by the way this is also a misconception  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=578) which many orientalists felt that they  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=581) thought the original writing was goofy  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=583) no kofi is a later one which is some  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=585) people regarded as some nice calligraphy  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=587) i myself regard coffee script as ugly  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=590) but listen taste is a matter of dispute  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=593) for me hijab script is much nicer it's  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=595) more like like a beautiful nas  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=597) which is the truth  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=599) the reality historic reality is that  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=601) the original writing which we know now  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=603) from the parliament of berlin amazon and  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=606) and many other sources must be a jazz  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=608) script  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=609) which is like which has developed into a  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=611) nice nas recently like  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=614) or the arabic tradition of microsoft and  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=617) so on looks very similar  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=620) later on there are many evidences which  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=622) indicate that someone was at least  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=624) sufficiently educated about the form of  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=626) writing that he instructed them to write  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=628) and what to write and what which  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=629) punctuation they should use okay so this  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=632) is  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=632) the first fundamental one but  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=634) independent of that  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=637) they are  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=638) redictated and they were there according  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=641) to his pronunciation  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=642) clearly  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=644) there's another point which has been uh  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=645) people discussing in history is that  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=649) in most  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=650) the fragments and also  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=652) the full written document which we have  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=654) in yemen which has come from that which  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=656) has been by by uh  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=658) by irradiation dating and so on uh uh  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=661) proven to be from time over the lorries  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=664) which is about 100 hijri so it's very  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=666) very early but also the fragment of  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=668) birmingham which is almost with  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=669) certified not with  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=671) dating wise must be written by a  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=673) companion  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=674) we have most letters  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=677) not punctuated because the arabic  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=679) letters they differ sometimes in shape  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=681) by punctuation that's not the case in  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=683) hebrew in arabic  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=685) like for example the difference between  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=689) it's the same shape  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=690) but the ha is having no dot no no point  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=693) no dot there's a dot not dotted  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=696) is a dot on the top and the g mu dot in  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=698) the bottom or in the inside the belly of  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=700) the g  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=702) it has benefited even without these dots  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=707) some people  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=710) speculated  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=711) that as dotting has been added later  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=713) because there have been a narration say  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=715) the first one who dotted the quran is a  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=717) hajj others say no no it has another  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=720) tabula and so no no actually  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=722) did some dotting all of this is a  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=724) mistake because the dotting they meant  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=725) is something else i will come to it  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=727) but the dotting of of letters  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=730) was available in arabic at that time but  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=732) it seems to be  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=734) the old evidence security because the  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=736) fragment of birmingham for example have  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=738) no thoughts  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=740) and i think the one of  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=742) sana'a the one  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=744) which is a full quran complete nothing  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=746) missing  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=749) of a thousand parchments a thousand  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=751) sheets  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=752) plus  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=753) uh it's not dotted if i'm not mistaken  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=755) but it could be partly dotted i'm not  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=757) sure  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=759) that must have been left deliberately  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=761) why some people say the arabic language  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=762) did not have those that time but this is  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=764) have been proven to be false how is it  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=766) how we can prove that with absolutely  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=768) certificate on two idea evidences one  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=770) evidence is that a iraq has been found  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=772) that there is someone inscribed  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=775) that praising honorable making invoking  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=779) mercy on on abu bakr and in and praising  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=783) the style the wording of the writing is  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=785) clearly  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=786) indicative that it is written in the  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=788) time obama  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=790) died may allah did well and so on and  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=793) now we have umar may allah support him  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=796) or guide him or  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=798) something like that meaning the one  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=799) who's writing like describing the rock  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=801) you know people go in holidays or in  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=804) trouble and some people have that which  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=805) is good it's good that allah is to get  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=807) people to write something on the exam  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=809) well she leaves many scripts cry  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=811) many writing on walls on rocks on caves  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=815) uh even the drawings on the caves of the  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=817) which is not writing but a drawing on  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=819) the caves of the cavemen  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=821) twenty fifteen thousand years ago all of  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=823) that is give us some some vision of  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=826) history which is good that's some of the  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=828) traces of history which allah  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=830) instigated humans to still preserve  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=832) history partly  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=834) that that writing contains clearly  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=837) letter dots  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=838) than one having a dot and so on  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=841) so the letters there are dot so at the  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=843) time of omar  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=845) who died 23 hedging  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=848) the arabic letters have dots  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=850) and this man have and you know he was  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=852) described in a rock mostly using the  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=854) chisel and things like that which is  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=856) very troublesome but he even went to go  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=858) through the pain to adopt things  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=860) secondly we have a document which has  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=861) been found the parchment a skin  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=864) parchment  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=865) and which one after the conquest from  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=867) egypt  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=868) when the roman did the counter attack  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=869) but that's also in the time of warmer by  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=871) the way  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=873) from their context is clear from them  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=876) the roman did a counter attack because  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=877) it was back and forth for some time  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=880) and the some parts of middle and the law  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=883) middle uh egypt and maybe uh other egypt  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=886) or the lower part of our egypt like  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=888) south of over not cairo it was not kind  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=891) of the time it was memphis and so on but  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=892) south of that one of the villages which  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=894) was conquered early and they agreed on  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=896) jizya and things like that  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=898) one one one uh one battalion of muslims  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=902) uh they needed they they were short of  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=904) over carrying animals or horses so he  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=906) went to the the shifting of the village  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=909) and made with him an agreement in  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=911) writing an agreement is written both in  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=912) arabic on one side and the other side in  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=915) greek  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=917) made him an agreement that we take from  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=919) you from your horses now as we borrow  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=922) because he has no right to take by force  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=924) and that is there's absolutely no  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=926) islamic law and islamic governance  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=929) we take from you these horses  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=931) we  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=932) either we bring them back next year if  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=934) until next year we cannot compensate you  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=936) and bring you the horses  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=938) their  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=939) they force themselves for their value we  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=941) will deduct them from the jizya of next  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=943) year because the jesus is leaving the  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=944) year by year  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=946) and the agreement is written one side in  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=948) arabic and the translation in greek  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=950) the side in arabic  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=952) is also dotted than one having a  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=955) daughter and so on not this key  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=957) not uh  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=958) what they call the their classic marks  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=960) no okay  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=963) so so from these two evidences which are  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=965) independent multiple corroborating  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=967) absolutely and no way to falsify and the  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=970) punishment can be tested also by  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=971) radiation but also by the translation of  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=973) the greek and the language of the greek  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=975) and the historical and the reference of  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=977) the date is internal evidence that  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=979) external evidence we have absolute  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=980) evidence that the arabic letters have  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=982) been dotted so the ha and the  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=985) they were distinguished by the arabs in  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=986) mecca because it is impossible to  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=988) envisage that within the time from  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=990) makkah or medina until the time of um  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=993) only ten years they have the the arabic  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=995) letters having no doubt and suddenly the  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=997) game dots that's that's irrational  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=999) because the people who wrote that  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1001) document in egypt the commander of this  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1003) battalion and also the one who described  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1005) the unknown man who described that on  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1007) the rock  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1008) they are certainly uh in the age of 25  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1011) 30 we don't know that age but we can  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1013) assume that so they are born the time of  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1015) the revelation of the quran or even the  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1017) uh they are maybe in the 40s 50s  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1020) battalion commander should be maybe in  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1022) 30s 40s so he's definitely a companion  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1025) almost definitely i think he's a  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1026) companion almost certainly i think his  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1028) name is mentioned there it's almost  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1030) certainly a companion so he witnessed  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1032) some time without issues so uh his most  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1035) likely people usually they're reading  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1037) about usually most of the time when they  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1039) are kids and they're in their young  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1040) years so already in the time of the  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1042) national quran these dots the  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1044) the dotting of the of the of the roof  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1047) between ha ha  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1049) noon and ba was known and ba  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1052) in the oldest fragments it is only uh  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1056) i think anabra they call it an umbra  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1057) like like a small a small solution  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1060) there's no dot at the top or bottom you  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1062) can read it as a noun  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1064) or  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1064) if you have two dots below or the top or  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1067) a third you have three intro  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1069) now  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1072) so this is the topic the real topic of  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1074) the distinguishing letter  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1076) etc  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1079) now we can have two theories  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1082) one of it is that  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1084) let's assume it is a revelation let's  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1087) say just make two hypothesis one quran  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1089) is a revelation from the divine one it  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1090) is not a revelation is envisioned by  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1092) muhammad okay if said muhammad we don't  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1094) know whether our head that is that's why  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1097) the man is playing games or uh  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1100) the people the companion are playing  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1101) games but in even in that if it's a  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1104) revelation then and this is he is  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1106) ordered to tell his company to do that  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1108) or the companion has been led to write  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1110) it this way despite of that they have  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1112) this nothing in the arabic letters that  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1114) must be based on revelation either  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1115) israelis instructing them or allah  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1118) forcing them in that direction so we  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1120) make this fundamental assumption it's a  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1121) liberation then it is developed by allah  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1124) let's look what what does this entail  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1127) what what this hypothesis the assumption  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1129) number one assumption is two assumptions  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1131) there's no other assumption assumption  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1133) number one  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1135) it meaning it will open the door for  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1137) various possible readings  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1139) now let us see if you look at the quran  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1142) you you undot it and read it you will  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1145) see  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1146) that you read it almost like what we  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1148) have it now there is no other variation  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1150) except in a few places  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1151) like for example one of the most extreme  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1154) places and for example the  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1155) ayahuasca comes to you with a with a  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1158) weather report then  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1160) verify it  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1162) find  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1169) affirm yourself about his velocity  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1172) and both if they're written without any  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1173) dots  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1174) they would be looking the same  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1176) so in that case you can put in every  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1178) other place if you put that just  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1180) differently you will get something  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1181) nonsensical arabic language  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1184) in some places you may get two  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1186) variations  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1188) so  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1188) someone could conclude because they  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1190) study by revelation  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1192) knowledge and he ordered this to be like  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1194) that  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1195) both both possibilities are intended  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1198) to give  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1199) two variations so both are revelations  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1201) allah is capable  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1203) by by definition by necessity  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1211) and he ordered it to be written without  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1213) any dots  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1215) so any doting  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1216) you can't try all possible doctors all  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1218) would be nonsense you can accept these  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1220) two fatah yano  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1222) for evidence  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1225) by meaning evidence meaning an  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1227) independent evidence from his report  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1229) to find affirmation that is reported  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1232) again meaning finder  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1233) so one addresses the side of the  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1236) objective side you find the ability  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1238) another so this is the objective side or  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1240) find verification which satisfy you the  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1242) psychological side  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1244) two sides of the same reality  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1246) the same in other places another place  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1258) that's the writing  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1268) i will check the various readings  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1270) available if it is  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1271) my my best guess that it's actually  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1274) i will make you inheritance of the  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1276) domain of the rebellious people which  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1279) fits better the meaning but all three  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1281) ones making sense once  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1283) i will show you the country of the  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1285) rebellious people so you can start doing  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1288) the action necessary to take it over the  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1290) summer  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1291) another one is  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1292) the wall will become non-silent half  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1294) make it silent in the house reading  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1296) you'll find the circle on top of the  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1298) world  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1299) added later by the latest cry at the  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1301) later scholars to represent the half  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1303) reading because that law is not it's not  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1305) pronounced in house  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1311) meaning i make it apparent to you  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1313) and the third one which is i have to  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1315) check if there's any reading  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1317) known in history  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1318) it could be there's no reading it would  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1320) be done a singular reading really in  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1322) according to the classic definition but  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1326) that's all of them if you take all the  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1328) dots they will fit and including making  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1330) the y silent or not silent the world  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1333) so i will make you inheritance but  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1334) there's no other ways except this thing  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1337) and all of them make good sense although  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1339) my feeling is that or if it will make  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1340) the best sense but  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1342) that's my feeling that's nothing  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1344) scholarly really sound and well  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1346) established more than that just a favor  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1348) so this is uh the dots yeah  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1352) these are the dots  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1354) the letter dots or the character  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1358) dots like that dot the dot of the eye  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1361) in english we have which letter dot i  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1364) and the g the small j is having a dot  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1367) the small i is having a dot yeah what  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1369) else  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1372) that's it is there's anything having a  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1374) dot in english standard english  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1376) we don't have we have other like like a  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1379) circle or kringle uh in the case of a  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1381) scandinavian language like angstrom  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1384) which is this circle on top of it which  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1386) is used to describe used also in in  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1389) physics to describe this small atomic  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1392) length they use an a with a circle  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1394) tablet angstrom or something right but  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1396) this is let's stick to english english i  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1398) think it started latin is having  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1405) by the way in latin i think v and u are  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1407) very difficult to distinguish somehow i  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1409) don't know if that's because the old  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1411) inscription of rocks are difficult to  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1413) distinguish or it is genuine if anyone's  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1416) familiar with latin or can't check that  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1417) for us check it but it seems to me they  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1420) they don't make a distinction between v  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1422) and u  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1423) in latin  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1425) okay  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1426) so so that's that's available only so  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1429) some language they have something  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1430) everyone does not have any daughter any  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1432) dots in in their letters whatever  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1435) so that's the issue of dots so that i  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1437) would say this  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1438) if the other hypothesis we don't need to  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1440) bother about that because this the other  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1442) hypothesis is not from allah this will  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1445) contradict obviously the other evidences  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1446) of prophethood is actually contradicts  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1449) the face hypothesis because the first  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1450) hypothesis works out that every dotting  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1452) we do is either becoming nonsense  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1456) or give some sensible reading like in  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1459) the case  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1462) okay so that's we finish with that part  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1465) so the the fiction that the arabic  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1467) letters did not have these the days the  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1469) arabs did not at the time at least the  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1470) vision for quran did not make a  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1471) distinction between ha jim and kha for  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1474) example  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1476) and yeah all of them are just  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1478) anabra just take up  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1481) is a fiction based on not knowing  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1483) history probably and not understanding  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1485) it probably and not doing a complete  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1487) research and sometimes bad reports you  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1489) remember when we discussed in the first  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1491) few holocaust the reporting that usman  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1494) is the one who collected the quran this  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1495) is people trying to make forgive man  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1497) virtuously he doesn't deserve and does  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1499) it need  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1501) actually the first collection was was a  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1504) defense in in let's just say in an  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1506) official master reference book was in  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1508) the time of  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1509) but even that this is not correct and we  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1511) stressed that there had been  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1513) the hand of the sahaba there was a a a  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1515) must have at the house of the prophet  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1517) and which was taken over by uthman  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1521) and he was killing him with him until he  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1523) died  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1524) we have no uh  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1526) reliable report that the flashlight  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1528) because absolutely messenger of allah  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1530) you have so many people who can write to  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1532) you i am in he was appointed the  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1534) governor over time i don't have anyone  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1536) to write for me and i'm far away give me  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1539) your most help your combat you  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1544) so we can assume safely that even a  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1546) replacement was written for the  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1547) professor  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1548) it's no problem for him to the right one  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1550) so there was one  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1552) there was one  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1554) there the only thing russia walker did  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1557) is that all these wasabi have been cross  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1560) referenced together and one master kobi  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1563) this may hint that the muslim the copy  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1566) of the prophet sallam which could have  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1567) been a master one i  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1571) most likely was not replaced because he  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1573) took it in the tenth year and then the  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1575) varsity was busy with other things with  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1577) everybody for hajj was  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1579) sending the final campaign to the battle  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1581) or  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1582) led by alibnadi  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1585) with all these things maybe he did not  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1588) uh focus on that because  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1590) enough is there the copy of this  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1592) the coffee of away in the cab copy of  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1594) many others i have not many not hundreds  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1597) but few times and that's enough they  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1599) have sufficient many copies and all of  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1601) them are certified and read to him and  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1603) he verified them so  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1605) it's enough so maybe he did not  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1609) whatever it is  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1610) he did or he did not any other rama  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1613) decided to have one master kobe which is  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1616) should be saved in the house of the  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1617) prophet and  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1619) we will discuss why it was saved by  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1620) hassan not having any buddhism but  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1622) because i think hubsa was the only one  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1624) who was mastering reading and writing  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1626) so it doesn't make any sense to keep a  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1629) copy so people can copy from it or she  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1631) can read to be able to dictate to them  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1633) unless  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1634) one of the wives is is is first class  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1637) reader and writer and it's the only one  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1639) was hafsah that's the reason that's  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1640) nothing neighborism or any religious  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1643) standing if it would have been any place  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1645) of standing reality in the good relation  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1647) to the prophet it would have been  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1649) salam and not but neither of these two  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1651) seem to be  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1653) literally so  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1654) that's that's uh so this is the fiction  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1656) which people have because they did not  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1658) scrutinize all the reports and the very  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1661) generations which because  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1663) even in that case i would say the people  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1665) are more guilty than in the issue of  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1667) doting right i feel that you can't call  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1669) them guilty because the available  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1671) information is very deep and far away  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1673) but in that case actually the the son of  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1676) abu dawud  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1678) has collected a book called  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1680) which collected all these narrations so  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1681) you cannot say the nation are scattered  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1683) all over the places  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1690) here very difficult to have them in one  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1692) place there is a book there but it  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1694) seemed to be unfortunately this book has  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1697) not find that much attention and nobody  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1700) attended to it as it should be  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1702) otherwise nobody would have come to the  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1704) stupid idea that at the time of prophet  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1706) there was no messiah it was only  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1709) camel shoulders  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1711) and pieces of rocks and things like that  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1714) this nonsense should disappear now  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1715) completely from history we have not  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1717) enough information we have scrutinized  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1719) history that they should be clear there  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1721) will be enough muslim and enough  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1722) formalizer  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1724) okay and we have to read also the story  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1726) about the the initial writing of the  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1728) master kobe who shows that  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1730) we have to read it with between the line  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1732) what is the meaning what is yours then  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1734) as i said i am more inclined to believe  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1737) that because the master kobe kept at the  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1740) house of the world salaam was taken by  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1741) israel  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1743) and life  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1745) after after uh  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1747) is obviously not a quran  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1750) nor he is his memorizer he was not  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1752) attending daily to the prophet as we  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1753) know what he's admitted himself and he  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1756) does abu bakr to have a master copy and  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1758) the worker who is relying on these  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1760) copies everywhere we say no no we have  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1761) to have one in the center of this we  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1763) should take a  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1764) sound and good and solid idea and  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1766) ultimately what was persuaded which is  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1768) an excellent idea indeed and they wrote  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1770) the copy and they wrote a copy from the  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1772) uh it is a copy from the copy of but  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1774) they did a further stable verification  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1776) they wrote it out and repeat that again  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1778) they fit with the copy of  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1780) the cab from the his copy present in his  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1782) hand plus his memory and he's the number  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1785) one without in doubt secondly the copy  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1787) of uh  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1789) of the uh zade as a zedimite habit  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1792) and  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1799) and then they asked everyone to bring  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1801) what they have so they have both their  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1803) memories  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1804) both their hobbies  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1806) and  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1807) ask for two more witnesses in addition  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1810) for every bit and peace  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1812) for every bit and peace  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1816) so that so so that's it so we have we  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1818) have we have uh and and these bits and  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1820) pieces most likely were complete copies  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1822) of quran that you would have but also  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1824) some people have it in in their own  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1825) original punishment they brought even  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1827) their original parchments the people who  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1829) have kept original punishment and  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1830) project and since we are talking about  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1832) the time of year of abu bakr  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1835) it means that we have essentially  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1837) parchment and  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1839) it's unlikely that late in medina  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1842) and  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1843) obviously all the  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1844) quran the immediate quran has been  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1846) already transferred into parchments and  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1849) maybe  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1849) we're in bound together in the way the  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1852) lawyers have been bound in time past by  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1854) making the trend and so on so it's  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1855) already in messiah four so uh  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1858) the  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1860) the narration say they collect their  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1861) people came with what they have from  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1864) parchments or from from scrolls and from  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1867) from uh  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1868) from tablets from uh  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1871) from  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1872) shoulders from things like that  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1874) that's the narrator from his imagination  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1876) he thinking is getting whatever they  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1878) have in their head i don't think the the  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1880) the tablets and the other rocks and the  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1882) pieces of rocks and things that what  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1884) they're using in mecca in medina i think  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1886) they all have been transcribed in  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1888) complete assay before that long ago or  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1890) in parchment and they have enough waste  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1892) and money before uh two or three years  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1894) before the death of it that they will be  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1896) able to afford to have everything in in  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1899) yemeni  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1900) very nice smooth punishment it couldn't  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1902) be possibly that rock starting there but  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1904) the narrator  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1907) and then he added from his imagination  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1909) all of these other things which were  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1911) gone already long ago because the quran  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1913) was combined according to the narration  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1915) of abdullah ibn abdullah in the house he  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1917) said we were sitting on this right there  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1919) this is this is a casual narration has  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1921) nothing to do with the combination of  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1922) the quran but someone asked him  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1925) uh  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1925) we know that  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1927) ultimately both that are both the two  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1929) cities uh constantinople and the roman  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1932) rome will be conquered but which one  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1934) will be conquered faced and say oh let  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1936) me see we were sitting at them uh  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1939) let me bring my my my own records his  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1941) echoes were in in  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1942) he brought a box which has which has  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1945) locks and so on he opened the lock said  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1947) this is this is what i wrote in when we  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1949) were present  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1950) we were sitting on the messenger of  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1951) allah  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1952) combining the quran  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1956) quran so they have special sessions to  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1958) comprise  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1961) from various parchments and and  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1963) documents we bring it together in one in  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1966) one master place  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1967) and one master combination i said from  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1970) different notes which the moment of  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1972) revelation have been dictated whoever  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1974) presented that place we bring it down  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1977) and put it in one one masterpiece  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1979) combining the quran  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1981) and then he mentioned the story that uh  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1983) constructed nobody we conquered first  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1984) before but this is not an issue today  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1986) for us  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1988) and there's another relationship about  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1989) combination of the quran so the  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1990) composition of quran is being  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1992) continuously done  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1994) and abdullah bibulus was attending to  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1996) this session continuously and most  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=1998) almost certainly he has also is also  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2000) memorized  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2002) also  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2009) huge numbers of people present as well  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2012) so so that's that that that's it  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2015) so i would say  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2017) these fictions should be should be  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2019) swept away we should sweep these  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2021) fictions from the table about about the  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2023) combination of the quran  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2025) forget about them and forget about all  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2027) these these zigzag  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2029) claims of history sometimes motivated by  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2031) attributing some virtues or atmospheric  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2034) to him sometimes even even the story  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2037) that that uh  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2039) that the greatest agile for muslim  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2041) belongs to abu bakr because because it  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2043) happens in his time as narrated by zen  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2045) without even that we should gloss over  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2047) forget about that is it abu bakr water  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2050) they were enough  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2052) and enough master references and  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2054) absolute certificate even the time of  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2056) the prophet  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2057) and this is there should be no doubt  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2059) about this is historic fact now we  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2061) should regard that as absolutely  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2062) established  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2064) and the dots the dotting although we  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2066) rely on these two documents but also  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2067) necessary reason  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2069) must have been there and if it is not in  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2071) the initial mosaid then it must have  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2073) been  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2075) uh  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2076) avoided or ordered not to put there  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2079) deliberately  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2080) and it's only  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2082) actually someone could say this is a one  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2084) aspect of the miraculous nation of the  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2086) quran because if muhammad is being let  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2088) us say  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2090) an imposter  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2091) either he is deliberately what nobody  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2094) says in the world because all his life  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2096) and so show that he was absolutely  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2098) convinced about his own prophethood yes  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2101) but subconsciously he's overtaken by  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2104) by by by a deep psychological motivation  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2107) and thinking really that he's a prophet  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2109) which is not in that case question what  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2112) motivates someone  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2114) to order the people  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2116) for his master text to not to vote at  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2119) the dots there's no no no no no no no  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2123) evidence rational reason for that look  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2124) at it analyze it's just right  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2127) you are writing a book  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2129) and your regard is your life work the  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2131) most important thing you have brought  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2133) that the peak of your own life  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2136) and then you go there and then  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2137) deliberately mutilate some letters  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2140) unless you want to make a  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2141) cipher or code something like that like  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2143) that famous book which nobody has  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2145) decoded until now  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2147) otherwise  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2148) why should you remove the dots why you  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2150) should  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2152) make make various letters confusing  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2155) and as a human being usually you have  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2156) some only one word or two words in your  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2159) mind why you remove those which make it  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2161) uh  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2162) understandable  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2165) but there's there's nothing really in  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2166) the subconscious or in the normal human  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2169) experience which which indicate and we  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2171) have nowhere in human experience  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2173) anything like that except we haven't  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2175) said some writing underground writings  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2178) even from pharaoh times we should think  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2179) some any kind of code language because  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2181) it's most likely an underground group  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2183) which rebellious against the pharaoh or  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2185) we have this man for whatever  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2188) psychological reason writing a complete  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2190) book  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2191) in a code which nobody has disabled  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2192) until now you can't find this in the  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2195) youtube  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2196) nobody knows what how to decipher that  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2198) book until now or  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2200) there's some uh feminist movement  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2203) ancient feminist chinese movement and  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2205) they invented another  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2207) writing  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2208) which i think is being decoded but the  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2211) people regarded as a low class  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2214) chinese writing or something like that  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2216) that's all  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2218) we don't have any experience like that  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2219) someone remove essential parts of of the  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2222) dotting especially in the arabic  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2224) language the dots between ha ha g mason  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2226) is essential  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2228) okay i think this is this is maybe i i  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2231) would say this should be counted as  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2234) really a strong hint for the miraculous  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2236) nation corroborating the  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2238) initial assumption that's a divine  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2240) revelation so the divine is saying i  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2242) make it so  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2244) that i intend all these meaning which if  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2247) you put the dots makes sense and the one  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2249) who brings you variations you see it as  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2251) gibberish it's not arabic language it's  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2253) nothing  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2269) read it or one or two of the if there  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2271) are two or three possibilities you will  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2272) need one of them  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2274) that's all what happens okay so that's  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2276) concerning that that this is this  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2278) important part  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2280) and also concerning the confession  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2291) okay is that clear so that's it i think  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2293) this is a supportive evidence that the  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2295) initial hypothesis that says revelation  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2297) it supports that rather than  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2299) if it's the other one is irrelevant what  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2301) it has been but it is a question  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2304) how come  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2305) what motivates someone  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2307) of your subconscious record if  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2308) consciously is out of question because  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2310) we know this man there's no doubt now  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2313) nobody ever  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2315) of any sound mind or no of history claim  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2317) that he is deliberately dying and know  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2319) that he's  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2320) yes that's gone  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2322) even even the latest christian  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2325) missionary claimed that he was where he  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2328) received revelation from the devil so he  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2330) is not from him it's from the devil but  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2332) whatever it is  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2334) from him from the devil  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2337) from the divine yes the divine can make  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2339) that as an evidence that's for me see  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2341) that i can  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2343) order that to be removed the dots and  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2345) still if you dotted any way either you  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2347) get something  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2348) sensible and making sense and fits in  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2350) the meaning and give extra meaning and  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2352) at further aspects of the meaning or it  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2354) gives gibberish  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2356) and this is within with well within the  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2358) divine capability so i would say these  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2361) these punctuation are dotted which are  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2363) essential part of the character  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2365) drawing  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2367) uh the omitting them in in the case of  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2369) the ea they call us which is almost  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2371) certainly the case  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2373) according to all pastors we have from  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2375) illidans uh these are that's  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2379) more supportive it's not absolute  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2381) evidence but is the more supportive for  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2383) the divine origin of the quran than the  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2385) opposite  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2387) and i know about some people we became  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2388) doubtful  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2390) doubter because of that because they did  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2391) not look at the mother from all their  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2393) aspects they look enter in and  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2396) if it's from god it should be clearly  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2397) totally like us why god is capable of  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2400) giving various options and various  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2401) things and intending all of them  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2404) human beings are not so if you think it  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2406) must have been like that that's because  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2408) you will hear my limitation try to get  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2410) out of them and they say is it possible  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2412) for the divine to listen this that is  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2414) yes it's possible and if it makes sense  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2416) obviously it's clearly here it makes  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2417) sense in every situation you can't go in  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2419) what's up you you you do nothing for  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2422) example go for example what's happening  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2424) in morocco now they ride the calf  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2428) all the east and the oldest arabic world  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2430) they have the calf with two dots in the  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2432) top  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2432) in morocco there are a dot in the top of  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2434) the two dots but one in the top one at  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2436) the bottom if you read it at the first  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2438) you don't notice you read the problem  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2440) you have no problem with seeing it as a  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2442) cough  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2445) then you notice my goodness welcome that  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2448) ah this is the moroccan way of writing  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2449) cough  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2450) the far west way of writing the cuff  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2452) with dot above and dot below  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2455) no problem two dots  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2456) is definitely from the  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2458) chain different from the far and also  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2460) the shape is slightly different because  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2462) of calligraphy and so five feathers  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2464) occasion but  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/WAMIgyQ7QWk?t=2476) otherwise
