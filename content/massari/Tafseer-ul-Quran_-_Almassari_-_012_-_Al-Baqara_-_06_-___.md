Al-Haidid later called it Khadar or Barium, aggregate which is essentially jabber. The issue of Qatar and Kaaba was advocated and propagated by the ili scholars irita, like Macronutrient, who do not believe in free human choice. They used to nickname them or insult them by calling their qadhari and their long discussion where the qadhari whether or not qadhari. They were cuddly in the correct sense, but they understood the meaning of Qatar the ming of Qatar is explained in Hadhana there is a hadith and with some sahaba what is the qaddafi is meaning that whatever good and evil in the universe is created by Allah there is no second thing that's we discussed. Also, there's no it's i think it comes with the second volume which will come soon inshallah before maybe for the end of the year it's created allah there's no second deity there's no good god and bad god, there is no two brothers fighting at each other the good one is called allah
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m722n0ZG3uE&t=1800)**  discusses how the people of the mountains who were supposed to protect the Muslims with arrows and artillery were defeated by the quraysh when college started retreating and they became more concerned about the booty than obeying the message. Allah then took this opportunity to punish the people by taking 70 shaheed as Shaitan's punishment.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m722n0ZG3uE&t=2100)** explains that all events in the universe are determined by Allah, and that even the choice of initial parameters is predetermined. also explains that an agent who acts freely and chooses is necessary for an universe to exist, and that this being is ultimately God. This theory is contrary to the current state of the universe, which is not possible according to the speaker's analysis.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m722n0ZG3uE&t=2400)** discusses how Allah has complete control over the universe and all that happens therein, and how there is no cover in terms of what he knows and when he knows it. He goes on to say that the current theory of relativity is a good description of phenomena on Earth, but it cannot describe the whole universe fully. The quantum theory, with its absolute time, is more correct. In any competition between the theories, the quantum theory has been proven to be correct in some cases.

He points to the existence of a necessarily existing being, which is absolutely free and spontaneous, and which does not have to obey the laws of the universe. This being is called "allah," and is the one who made the universe and chose to create the human race.

He discusses the difference between "ta'seer ul-Quran" (the interpretation of the Quran) and "ta'seer ul-Akhbar" (the interpretation of the historical context of the Quran). He argues that while ta'seer ul-Akhbar is important, ta'seer ul-Quran is the definitive interpretation of the Quran. He goes on to say that while most scholars believe that the decision of whether or not to punish or forgive someone is up to Allah, some scholars believe that the decision is postponed until Allah commands it. He concludes by saying that while it is impossible to know what Allah's decision will be, it is clear that Allah is eternal and that He has Himself in His being.

If a person does not make any mistakes in life, they will be rewarded with a good life in the afterlife. However, if a person makes mistakes, they will be punished in the afterlife.

* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m722n0ZG3uE&t=4200)** discusses various issues related to free will, concluding that there is no evidence to support the idea that human beings have a genuine free will. He explains that the Quran expresses necesssity of reason as the only way to know that allah is free of responsibility for events.

[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=29) i mentioned some comments last time  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=31) about salut and sally  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=32) and said that the ones who claim that  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=34) salah is from sally  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=36) are mistaken and i mentioned also the  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=38) indexed  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=43) be a little bit  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=46) with a nicer organization by giving the  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=49) intermediate routes  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=51) in the top of every root separation  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=53) because you just put three stars there  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=55) the beginning of another root but it's  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=56) good to mention the root there  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=58) he's relying the people they will  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=59) analyze understand but that's  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=62) for the future insha allah we may  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=63) suggest that and maybe someone will  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=66) re-edit it and improve on it or  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=67) something like that  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=70) but also i mentioned that kantara  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=72) kantara and kentar  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=74) if you analyze them in arabic terms  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=76) everyone say  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=77) kantara which is means a bridge must be  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=80) from the root of kantar  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=82) kaff no the same with  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=85) but they say they're definitely of  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=87) various origins they have to be heard  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=89) they are  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=90) they are imported from non-arabic  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=91) language anyway but became arabic words  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=94) of course this is about if you give one  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=97) woman as you cannot take anything from  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=100) it  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=101) if you take it this is a is a vicious  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=103) sin and it  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=104) will be so kanpai is used in arabic and  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=107) this comes from  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=108) from kintar and hundred weights they  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=111) said you know what he called in english  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=112) hundreds hundred pounds which is maybe  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=114) nowadays uh  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=115) uh 47 point something kilogram or  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=118) something 100 weight  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=120) the other word kantora is also from  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=122) latin i found the following interesting  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=124) things that means  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=126) it is origin it's originally but so in  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=129) arabic that coincided and if someone  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=131) just  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=131) looks at arabic alone he will think  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=133) they're from the same root and will  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=134) wonder  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=135) what has to do with control of that  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=138) big amount of gold to do with the bridge  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=140) it has hasn't to do with  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=142) completely different uh roots at the  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=145) root for  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=145) for kantara is coming also from latin  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=148) it's called king tura  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=150) originally or sing to rao jing  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=154) or king kotora or something like that we  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=156) go to how the c is pronounced  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=158) allah knows how it was pronounced by the  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=160) by the roman  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=161) but we know how it forms out nowaday it  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=163) is either k or c  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=164) depending on the position in english for  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=166) example and in french  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=168) and in turkish turkishes goes far away  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=170) even they have nothing to see to be and  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=172) all the  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=172) a b c r b j this is g yeah  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=176) interesting like for example there is  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=179) a child miner called hajer written h  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=182) a h-a-c-e-r and everyone called here the  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=185) english people is  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=188) reading it as a singer so that  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=191) that's how things could could get  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=193) confused and that's actually hazard  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=195) and she she knows that she's had it but  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=196) she doesn't  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=211) the second one has been dropped because  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=212) it's heavy to pronounce so it became  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=214) kin torah and became kantara and  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=217) originally in  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=217) in latin it means either belt  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=222) or hangar clothing hangar because it's  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=225) like an arc it says they have an accent  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=227) anything else shaped  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=229) but we say what has the belt to do that  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=230) actually also because belts are usually  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=232) if you hang them  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=234) they become an arc shaped and or if you  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=237) belt the horse it would be actually so  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=239) it has to the arc shape  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=241) and obviously the bridges the roman  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=243) buildings are shaped because of  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=244) mechanical is anyone who you have  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=246) studied  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=246) mechanic knows that it has to be so that  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=249) that the weight  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=250) and the force will be distributed going  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=251) all the way to the right  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=253) and then beginning the food of the  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=256) bridge at the end of the bridge  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=257) so all the pressure will be there  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=259) carried by by the soil  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=261) all the way to a certain depth anyway so  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=263) this is  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=264) so it's completely different way the  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=266) other way is from uh  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=267) from uh from other kingdoms  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=271) and to the word sent whenever  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=275) one of a hundred likes the american  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=276) scent etc comes from that  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=278) so it's completely different words but  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=280) they merge together so this could happen  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=282) with other ways possibly maybe once  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=284) usual  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=285) uh like which will come to one where the  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=287) cover could it be maybe it's a  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=288) confluence of two different words from  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=291) all the semitic language we don't know  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=293) we'll see  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=295) so this is a relation about some arabic  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=298) roots maybe  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=299) uh it looks like one root really  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=301) unconfluenced  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=302) in case of salwa and saliya the  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=304) conference happened in the revelation  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=306) etc meaning the horse which come next  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=309) touching the first one  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=310) is coming from saliya like touching the  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=313) hell fire and so on  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=316) the one who is praying is coming from  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=318) salawah from salah to a dwarf and those  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=319) in quran is written with wow to indicate  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=321) its original  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=322) and and um interestingly many scholars  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=325) of tabs here did not notice this point  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=327) and thought that everything can go to  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=328) the root of salia it's not true it's two  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=330) different roots there  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=332) but because the final letter is is  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=335) essentially a vowel or a long vowel  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=337) vowels are weak they're called  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=340) sick sick letters or sick characters  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=342) they can easily change into any one  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=344) another  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=345) it can be a can become an a or o  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=348) depending upon  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=349) what is behind and after so that's the  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=351) horror film that they are easily changed  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=353) and then some of the derivative was may  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=356) coincide although they are from  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=357) different ways and completely different  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=359) worlds they have nothing to do with each  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=360) other  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=361) so that's that's just a small remark  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=364) because  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=366) i think we should not uh spend much more  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=369) time on this one and continue with the  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=371) with the quran uh when it says uh we  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=375) said that  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=375) we we essentially adjusted  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=386) we will face this problem of divine  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=388) actions uh  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=390) actually uh i was going not to go very  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=393) deep in that but  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=394) it seems to an escape of lucasarasi  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=397) which i said is one of the  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=398) i would say one of the best of us here  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=401) although the salafi do not like i said  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=402) it has everything except i see it that's  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=404) not true it has plenty of tips here  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=406) he opens many problems with theology and  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=409) animal kalam and so on  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=410) and they are of relevance uh it comes  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=414) for example  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=416) in the next one there's another divine  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=417) action mentioned that and issues  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=420) how allah acts in time etc and it will  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=423) release again to kadar so we'll get us  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=424) to that  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=425) we'll have to summarize that again based  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=427) on that what the quran  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=431) says about about that but that's when we  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=433) get rid of  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=449) scholars said this relates to the  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=451) originally those  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=452) who were originally muslim arab muslim  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=455) these  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=455) did not have here before that they did  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=458) not talk about akhir they do not have a  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=459) previous revelation and they become  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=461) turkey they become allah aware  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=472) uh related to those people of the book  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=474) which have  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=476) they were believing in previous  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=477) revelation but now they added through  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=478) the last revelation where mars  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=484) is a category of the people of the book  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=487) some other scholars say no it's there to  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=489) all the believer  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=490) as a because it applies to all of them  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=493) even those who  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=494) who uh who were originally mushrikeen  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=497) have no previous stimulation they must  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=499) have come through the final revelation  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=500) to believe in the final revelation  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=502) that's the meaning of iman between the  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=503) final revelation  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=505) on the opposite of his coffer and  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=508) uh through that and the report of the  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=510) rest of them they know there's a  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=511) previous revelation and they believe in  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=512) it in summary  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=515) so this applies to the muslim and they  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=517) must be also  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=518) the most important aspect of the last  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=520) days they believe in that also  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=523) so whatever it is either two categories  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=524) of believer allah is praising them  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=526) or one category and the ayah is more  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=530) explaining what is part of  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=531) rape and the  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=550) one of the most important thing is that  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=552) they believe that what's had been  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=553) revealed to you and  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=554) revealed before so this means they  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=556) believe in revelation  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=558) and revelation is usually normally  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=560) mediated by angels  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=562) initiated by allah military by angels so  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=564) they believe  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=565) in the angels as heavenly messengers and  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=567) they believe also human messengers  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=569) in contradiction to seculars  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=572) and pagans who say allah did not send  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=574) any messenger this will influence our  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=576) freedom  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=577) that's the secular argument we couldn't  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=579) possibly have sent messengers  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=581) otherwise why did he give us he's in our  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=583) mind  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=584) by the way this is the rhyme in point of  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=585) view that humans have their own mind  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=588) they don't need messengers  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=590) that's what they they they they claim  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=591) doesn't in their philosophy  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=593) it's not the common hindu and so on no  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=595) no but i mean the most sophisticated  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=596) abraham and philosophers in the  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=598) philosophies  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=599) so they are genuinely secular in that  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=601) sense  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=603) so that's that's the most important part  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=604) of here because all previous messenger  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=606) and also that would come to the  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=608) messenger is rape you don't receive it  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=610) or they have no access to it but you  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=611) have all the reports of the prophet and  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=613) you have the evidences  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=614) of the prophethood so you assert that by  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=616) evidence  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=631) the last usual ascension is the last day  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=633) the last day  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=634) but for that the first days are the near  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=636) days so the dunya is called dunya  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=639) because it's from the  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=640) danaya that to know becomes close the  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=642) one which is close to us is dunya  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=644) and the one is far away from us later is  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=647) akhira  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=647) and what is later is usually late  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=650) usually  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=651) far away from us what what we are what  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=654) we are aware about is what is  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=655) close to us is the immediate the present  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=658) the future even tomorrow is ah  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=662) relative to today but what is meant is  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=664) that  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=665) the last days that the end of the world  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=667) the second world the second phase of the  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=669) world  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=670) obviously is not that such a second  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=672) world exist some physicist may say  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=674) the universe will go in a hyper crunch  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=677) and then the emerge again a second word  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=679) that's not what it the meaning of it is  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=681) not that  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=682) that's physically going to happen it is  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=685) that it is  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=686) that is going to happen with whatever  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=688) mechanism it is not necessarily by a  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=690) mechanism of  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=691) a hybrid crash or something you know it  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=692) could be another mechanism  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=694) by shabbai that's the universe expanding  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=696) and then  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=697) actually would be relative to the people  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=699) of  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=701) was the earth the earth will be changed  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=703) and then  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=704) the rest of the universe will continue  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=705) expanding it's not necessary  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=707) that the whole universe have to end and  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=709) the new universe starts that's not  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=711) necessary but it could be  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=712) all points of view are possible from the  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=715) revelation  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=716) there's nothing in the revelation  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=717) indicating that is different  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=720) indicating a really a clear mechanism  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=724) even the eye is not still could one  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=726) within the  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=727) heaven as we turned the uh  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=730) the folder book could be sama could  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=734) meaning the whole universe  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=735) because the word salami was above us it  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=737) could be only  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=738) dunya could be even the atmosphere the  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=740) atmosphere may be wound  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=742) around and changed could be local event  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=744) could be a universal event so even that  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=746) is not really  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=747) uh uh unless you read it really in a  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=751) shallow way but  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=751) in the edible meaning is not the same  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=753) quest could be mean  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=755) dunya could be the upper atmosphere of  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=757) their slayers so  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=758) all of these are the possible meaning of  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=760) samara that's  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=761) one place where people get stuck and  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=763) have a problem because they interpret  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=765) some  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=766) sometimes it must be these seven heavens  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=768) or these planetaries  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=769) not necessary for example the whole  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=772) uh known universe is dunya because it's  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=776) it's it's enlightened by masami has  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=777) enlightened by south and will do this  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=779) stars are the normal phenomena  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=781) in galaxies all the way to the border of  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=783) the visible universe so this is  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=784) up to the visible universe it's a  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=788) dunya in one in one point of view  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=791) that's seven the seven heavens mentioned  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=794) may be  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=795) seven layers of the atmosphere  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=798) and this has nothing to do even with the  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=800) stars so all of these  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=801) things have to be seen in context and  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=804) integrated  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=805) otherwise you will be uh you will be in  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=808) trouble like many people simple-minded  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=810) usually single-minded atheists are in  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=811) trouble instead of going to the  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=813) essential core meaning which is  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=815) compulsory there's anything above us  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=818) including the various layers or  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=819) atmosphere and in every eye we have to  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=821) see  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=822) which surmisement really  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=825) i'm going to say about allah  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=831) the one as human convention is that  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=834) allah is  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=834) beyond the universe that is above  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=838) uh in the direction of above in  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=841) manner of excited excitation does not  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=843) relate to issue of space and time  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=845) in that sense it has to be analyzed  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=847) differently than that  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=849) so all of these things has to be to uh  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=851) to be considered when we get there  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=852) inshallah we will  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=854) touch on these in in proper time uh  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=857) without going too much which would be  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=859) overloading with the  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=860) because we this is recording will be  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=863) available for the public  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=864) but it should go deep enough to refute  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=866) some of these misconceptions  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=868) and some of these funny ideas go going  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=870) in people's minds  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=871) sometimes so that's what  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=874) has meant here the next universe or next  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=876) life is really  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=878) what it in what it's on my mother see  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=880) whether there's a resurrection  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=882) and which obviously those believe in the  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=885) hyper crash will not believe because for  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=887) them  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=888) this will crash will finish this  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=890) universe completely and universe will  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=891) emerge  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=892) there's no resurrection frame so that  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=894) the their akka is not that what  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=896) is required to be believed in in quran  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=898) secondly there beside the resurrection  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=900) that these people addressed now  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=902) will be resurrected and they will be  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=904) questioned i will be accounted  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=905) and they will be either either rewarded  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=908) or penalized  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=909) that's that's a meaning of achara  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=912) so that's that's uh so just regarding  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=917) uh is it is it really two categories or  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=920) believers or one category of believer  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=923) even if they originally two mentioned  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=924) that each one of them is praised  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=927) ultimately they merge together after  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=929) that they join in the same  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=930) by believing in in the final revelation  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=933) muhammad sallam  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=934) and this is the cornerstone of iman this  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=936) is the opposite ejecting the prophet  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=938) that's the cover  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=939) they have all  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=943) air and praise and these are the ones  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=945) within the next ayah comments about them  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=949) what's the next i comment about them  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=952) the next ayah says  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=959) those mentioned previously  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=962) being it one category or two categories  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=965) they are on a guidance from their lord  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=968) and those are  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=974) like you can't read the  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=977) letter i didn't have opened the  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=979) translation any one of you opening that  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=981) translation site i mentioned last time  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=983) islam way etc  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=986) let me open it  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=990) see what what the various translation  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=991) says i should have opened it earlier but  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=994) i forgot about it let me open it now  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=997) it takes one one minute so i'm sorry for  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1000) that  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1003) okay  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1006) it's de-buried in and fold us  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1010) inside for the sunshine but this is okay  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1013) quran quotation  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1019) and we can put the site here islam  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1023) awakened  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1024) dot com islamic.com keep that society  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1027) in mind because it gives you quite a  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1030) number of  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1031) uh of option translation deprecated  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1034) translation  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1035) things which are questionable things  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1036) which are agreed upon which is good it's  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1038) a good reference  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1040) now we can't compare with that what uh  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1042) what we have  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1044) from the arabic tabs here and so on  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1046) obviously it  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1047) these translations try to get the just  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1050) get as much as possible of  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1053) of uh  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1060) okay so let's go to this ayah see what  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1063) what how they translated  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1065) and compared to the fine points of  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1067) arabic language which we  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1082) okay  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1091) so go to the  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1106) so  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1117) so that's a diverse translation for  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1119) example  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1120) mohammed it is they who follow their  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1124) guidance  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1125) which comes from their sustainer and it  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1128) is they  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1129) who shall attain to a happy state  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1134) that's one translation let's see what  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1136) spectral says  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1138) these depend on guidance from the lord  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1141) these are the  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1142) successful okay so etcetera so if you  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1144) have augmented in front of you that's  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1146) i said islam awakened dot com quran  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1150) slash two slash five default him and  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1153) this is the  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1154) fifth eye of second soul okay in the  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1156) counting of uh it is the fourth in our  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1159) counting but it's because  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1160) i mean for us doesn't matter  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1163) for that for the meaning others it's  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1165) just for the counting  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1168) okay let's see what were the fine points  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1169) which these translations all miss  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1174) let us go to  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1189) in arabic language meaning really cut  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1191) and break  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1193) and for mr or when this road comes  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1197) the farmer the one who cut because the  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1199) most significant apparent work of harm  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1201) is that they plow that  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1202) the power because by the plowing you  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1204) break the earth and  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1206) make the addition in it and then when  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1208) you put the seeds under cover them  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1209) that's it  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1210) but the ploughing is an essential uh  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1214) and the plough the plow is essential  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1216) tool of the of the  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1218) the farmer what does  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1222) mean is essentially those who have cut  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1225) through and break through the hardships  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1227) and  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1228) the tribulation of the this universe and  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1230) achieve that what they wished for which  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1232) is success  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1233) and happiness and salvation so it is the  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1235) successful one  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1236) but it gives more taste the one who have  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1239) broken through to success  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1241) which indicate that getting to success  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1245) is not an easy job because the universe  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1247) that's a part of the color issue which  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1249) will come to it  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1250) is fashioned or this universe this life  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1253) is fashion so  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1254) that it is a testing universe it's for  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1256) testing  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1257) tribulation and that requires  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1260) some effort to cut through  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1263) and break through so those have cut and  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1265) bred but those have  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1267) broken through to that what they wish to  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1270) achieve  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1272) and became successful in this in the  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1274) over so much so this is not just simply  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1277) the successful is more than  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1279) successful after an effort and breaking  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1281) through the one who broke through to  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1282) success and happiness  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1284) so it's much stronger than just a  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1285) successful but you see  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1287) the translator did his best for example  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1289) pictol  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1290) could have but it would make the  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1293) transition a bit clumsy could for  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1294) example i said  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1296) uh these are the successful i would say  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1298) these are who broke  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1299) who made a breakthrough and became  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1302) successful  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1303) that will give more the meaning of falah  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1306) but still the other successful is good  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1309) it's good but it is not  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1310) doesn't give the nuances of the word  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1314) yeah so that's that's one point  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1322) literally on guidance from their lord  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1326) on guidance from their lord  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1330) yeah that you see how the people are now  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1333) struggling in translation  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1335) because some people understood that  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1339) that they are on guidance from the lord  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1341) that they are complying with the  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1342) revelation which has come down when the  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1344) guidance committee and the  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1345) legislative sense in the sharia sense  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1347) allah send the guidance  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1349) and they are on that guidance they are  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1351) complying with that guidance  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1353) so it doesn't relate to an issue of  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1355) qadhar but they are under guidance was  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1358) not any guidance  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1360) detected by their own rational qualities  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1362) out there no but it's after the times  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1363) the answers  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1364) come from their lord which they have  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1366) achieved  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1367) raised and understood and enjoyed  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1370) by using the rational faculty and their  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1372) analysis et cetera no doubt about that  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1374) but it is not just  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1377) let's say the achievement of  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1379) mathematical theory for example  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1382) it is not it it is not the  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1385) the the pythagorean theorem you detect  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1388) the theorem and then you add it  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1390) although you could say also it's  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1391) gathered from the world because that's  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1392) the way your mind has been framed that  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1394) is capable of that  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1395) but it's not a part of revelation so  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1396) huda here meaning  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1398) the shariah the guidance which come by  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1399) revelation so  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1401) that's that's one one point which is  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1403) seem to be self-serving  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1405) these are true guidance from their lord  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1408) the true god is that they're the one  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1410) coming this is just ali  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1411) pikton said the these depend on the  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1414) guidance from their lord  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1417) that says distance is not clear um  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1421) if him is now the guidance in the  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1422) meaning of sharia what has come with  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1424) revelation or the guys being allah said  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1427) guiding the people to embrace fears by  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1430) whatever mechanism it is which we have  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1432) to discuss  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1433) so the practical translation does not  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1436) make it clear is that he mentioned the  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1438) huda in the sense of sharia the guidance  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1440) which comes from  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1442) like what he is saying about the  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1444) messenger  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1449) you give the straight path explain to  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1450) the people and the people have to  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1452) embrace it  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1453) have to walk on it so addressing only  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1456) the sharia's part  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1458) offering the guidance how the guidance  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1461) happens how it's related to the universe  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1462) how it is to qatar is not mentioned in  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1464) this direction  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1465) but it could be meaning also they are  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1467) the one who are guided by their road in  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1469) matter of cuddle and so on  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1471) and this will open some deep questions  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1475) and the raji as usual because he loves  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1477) these three theological and  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1479) karam issues and philosophically they  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1482) indulge in that or considerable amount  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1487) and this would become also imminent when  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1489) we come to catharines  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1492) now this we have get now in a real  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1494) problem then so  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1495) there's there is no way to to escape  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1498) from the discussing nation of qatar  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1504) the issue of qatar and kaaba has been  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1507) confused  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1509) initially in the time of sahaba and even  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1511) the illiterate in the greater being  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1521) meaning the one who denied qatar  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1523) according to what al hadid later called  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1524) khadar or barium  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1526) regate which is essentially jabber which  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1528) is really there's no  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1529) human choice uh  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1533) propagating that saying it is decided  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1536) that we rule  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1537) so we are listening to ruling it could  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1539) it be otherwise that's the way you're  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1540) trying to sell  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1541) their uh their their their oppressive  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1544) rule as  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1545) is unavoidable is that what allah has  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1546) decided so  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1548) nothing can be done about that that's  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1550) that's the the political key why it was  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1554) advocated and propagated very strongly  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1556) but the ili scholars irita  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1558) like has almost like macronutrient they  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1560) do not believe in that they believe that  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1562) there's a free human choice and so on  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1563) and they used to  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1564) nickname them or insult them by calling  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1566) their qadhari  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1568) and their long discussion where the  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1569) qadhari whether or not qadhari  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1571) uh we have checked all the history we  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1573) did not find that they are really  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1575) qadhari  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1576) etc trying to defend them but if  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1579) you if you go really in deep history and  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1582) so on  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1583) they were cuddly in the correct sense  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1584) but they understood the meaning of qatar  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1586) the ming of qatar is explained in  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1590) hadhana there is a hadith  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1592) and with some sahaba what is the  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1595) qadhafi is meaning that whatever good  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1598) and evil in the universe  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1599) is created by allah there is no second  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1601) thing that's we discussed  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1603) also there's no it's i think it comes  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1604) with the second volume which will come  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1606) soon inshallah before  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1607) maybe for the end of the year it's  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1610) created allah there's no second  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1612) deity there's no good god and bad god  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1614) there is no two  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1615) brothers fighting at each other the good  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1617) one is called allah the battle is called  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1619) iblees  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1619) that's all this will do what is theory  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1621) is false  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1623) which is false by rational conclave  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1624) because it's impossible  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1626) for another deity to exist which is  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1629) eternal out of resistive reason  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1632) but if it it's even if we assume the  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1635) impossible  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1635) if they exist then they would notice  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1637) each other completely if they are both  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1639) eternal and necessarily existing if one  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1642) of them is created and so on by allah  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1644) then it  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1644) is impossible for the created being to  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1646) challenge allah and  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1647) undermine his actions that's not  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1649) possible there's no way that  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1650) it's conceivable so ultimately then  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1653) allah is the one who created the  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1655) the bad one or the devil they call devil  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1657) or the the bad god or something like  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1659) that  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1659) and then the question lies why did allah  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1661) create him so originally  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1666) the system of the universe whatever  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1668) regarded as evil even if it's not evil  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1670) in self but whatever human regard as  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1672) evil and bad  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1674) or against their interests and their  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1676) their well-being  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1678) which may be not necessary even in the  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1679) universal scheme but let's assume it's  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1681) evil  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1682) for example there are definitely evils  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1684) like for example people denying allah  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1686) or insulting him that's definitely even  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1688) because allah is not  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1689) deserving to be insulted and denied  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1692) that's definitely evil  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1693) this could not have ever happened in  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1695) this without allah permitting it to  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1696) heaven  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1697) and he's the one created the condition  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1698) which made it possible to happen  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1702) and the the person summarized that in  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1704) the hadith  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1705) and also  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1717) what has befallen you that's all in the  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1718) past what has befallen you could not  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1721) have been hit  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1723) had missed you and would have missed you  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1725) could not have will not befall in you  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1728) what does it mean i mean what has  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1730) happened in the past already that's what  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1731) happened  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1732) in the future refer to that what has  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1734) happened already  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1736) if people like or dislike it could not  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1739) have  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1740) missed you according to rejection  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1742) condition  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1743) at that time i was permitted to happen  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1746) it could not have missed you  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1748) does not mean that you don't study that  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1750) and see what the condition  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1751) possibly which have led to that  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1752) situation and you apply it in the future  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1755) to avoid  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1756) to avoid smith and the quran direct to  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1758) that for example  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1759) and this reason is important for this to  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1761) take all the evidence of the quran if  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1762) you stick to an ayah  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1764) you will end in in in in in  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1767) in misguidance when also adjusted the  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1770) calamity you know  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1771) it other people say what has happened to  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1774) us we are promised to be  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1775) victorious against the against the  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1777) disbelievers see  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1778) and we have promised that that we will  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1781) defeat them  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1783) allah says yes allah promise you to  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1785) defeat them  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1787) and and the promise will be going be  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1789) fulfilled  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1790) but then you have disobeyed the  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1792) messenger  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1793) and disputed that around yourself we  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1795) know what happens on the top of the  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1796) mountain  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1797) the the people the the the  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1802) the the the people who was  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1806) supposed to protect the back of the  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1808) muslims with arrows and  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1809) with with arrows let's just see the the  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1812) firing power the artillery  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1814) which is supposed to protect our back so  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1815) that the quraysh could not come with  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1817) horses  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1817) attacked from the back uh this they  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1819) could it could stop them from that if  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1821) they will  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1822) uh they they they will will fight them  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1824) with what they with their  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1826) intestinal hours and they were capable  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1827) of doing that but then when college  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1829) started retreating and they were in  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1831) defeat  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1832) the people in the mountains aircraft but  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1834) there is over the school and collect  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1835) moody they wanted more  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1836) they were concerned about the booty more  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1838) than about obeying the message  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1840) absolutely  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1840) ordered them so you stay on the mountain  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1843) continue to do  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1844) your job even if you see the bears  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1846) eating us in pieces  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1847) don't come down more than that what you  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1850) want  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1850) of clear instruction so this will be the  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1852) messenger they disputed with the  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1854) commander the commander  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1855) you stay here you stay you don't go  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1858) don't worry about the booty they don't  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1859) bother  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1860) they worry about the booty and they went  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1862) and then held everybody notice that the  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1863) mountain is now  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1864) the back protection is not there until  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1866) around and the  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1867) the success tended to be so from that  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1869) we'll end that you cannot dispute the  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1871) commanders  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1872) you should not change the battle order  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1874) until the commander decides according to  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1876) the  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1878) if you do that you lose but that's what  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1881) has happened  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1882) as allah says in quran permitted to  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1885) happen  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1885) for the reasons he mentions within the  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1887) quran and some reason  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1889) is not mentioned and some reasons are  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1890) narrated by other stories which  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1892) are quite complex and just add this  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1894) today allah took this opportunity  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1896) to take 70 shaheed as a punishment for  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1900) that what they did in badr but this is  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1901) uh addressed in the book of taheed in  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1903) the arabic version  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1904) in an appendix called uh they have been  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1907) punished for that what they did  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1909) i'm not sure if that has been translated  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1911) in in in the volume one i think  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1914) the translator decided this is too  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1915) technical it doesn't fit  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1917) i'm not sure maybe we have to review it  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1919) anyway  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1921) so that has happened it could not have  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1923) not happened it has happened  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1926) you learn from it for the future does  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1928) not mean you don't study it  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1930) but don't be don't go into a lamentation  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1934) it should not go into a lamentation and  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1938) a never-ending funeral procession no you  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1941) overcome that you study it  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1943) apply it for the future as the quran  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1944) instruct you to do  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1946) you have disputed between yourself and  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1949) you want a dunya  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1950) instead of obeying the messenger so you  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1952) got that  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1954) in the future you have to avoid that you  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1955) have to learn that but there is no sense  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1957) in lamenting  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1958) and indulging in never-ending uh  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1962) uh object whereas no that's no no said  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1965) that  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1965) the same with what what what you have uh  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1968) gotten it could not have missed you  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1970) because the objective condition will do  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1972) that and allah permitted it to happen  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1973) there's no way anything in the universe  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1975) will happen with allah provision that's  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1977) the meaning of qatar  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1978) that's the beginning of qatar it does  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1979) not mean that this has been decided  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1981) before the beginning of time  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1983) for the creation or being written there  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1985) because the hadith of qatar which has  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1987) been written at the beginning  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1988) before the creation of the heavens and  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1990) earth is  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1992) that's the correct wording is the  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1994) proportion and the system of the  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1995) universe  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1996) and what is contingent what's possible  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=1998) or not possible that's that  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2000) this event will happen or not happen is  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2002) not written  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2003) was written is the system and as the  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2006) time develops  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2008) as the beginning of the creation the  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2010) start the time started so  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2012) when when when we read the book of  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2016) what's his name the one who died  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2017) recently a brief history of time time  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2020) has a history  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2021) and the time the absolute time of the  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2023) universe  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2024) is initiated by allah even the prophet  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2027) said allah is the time or the aeons or  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2029) the dhar  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2035) that's the events of the universe so the  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2036) events of the universe allah's action  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2039) and he's the one in control of that and  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2041) whatever happens in  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2042) in time so definitely time is  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2045) progressing but time  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2046) and the events as you go are the  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2048) complete control and the  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2050) mastery of allah but  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2053) it's not that these events have been  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2055) decided that time on the specific events  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2057) what has happened that means that time  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2058) no  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2059) it was decided at the moment based on  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2061) the objective conditions  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2063) and the decision was with allah  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2064) prohibition  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2068) if they did not distribute if this is  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2070) all this obviously this is an imaginary  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2072) construct  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2072) because they disputed that the servant  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2074) had gone but if they don't have disputed  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2076) and they obey the messenger they would  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2078) have not been defeated i did not have  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2080) suffered these losses  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2082) just if that has that's all that's just  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2084) just a imaginary construct  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2086) and until the until they went to the  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2088) battle it was still open  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2089) and the decision was made there when  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2091) they when  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2092) when when they they disputed allah  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2095) allowed them to be destroyed to dispute  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2097) and uh allowed the quraysh to overcome  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2100) them and allah allowed them to lose  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2102) seventy shade  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2104) that's all but allah allowed is it  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2108) it will be not correct to say that has  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2109) been already known and decided  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2111) with what the creation of their ways or  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2113) at the creation of it that's not correct  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2114) but the qatar the system of the universe  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2116) so that may this may develop and happen  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2118) is decided there this will settle many  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2122) of the questions over in the quran and  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2123) it fits with the with the with uh  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2127) but since most muta khalimi later got  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2129) stuck in a so-called theory that  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2131) such event or changes of events cannot  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2133) happen in the divine being because  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2135) an eternal being cannot have events in  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2138) himself which is  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2139) an assumption which has no evidence of  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2141) that all evidence of the quran or  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2143) evidence of logic because there's no  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2145) rational condition saying that an entity  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2147) which does action  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2149) must be necessary itself an action not  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2151) necessary there's none this that they  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2152) are no proof for that as a matter of  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2154) fact  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2156) allah is definitely acting acting by by  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2158) by your absolute  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2159) freedom and then for spontaneity so  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2163) that does not negate that he necessarily  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2165) existing this is existing is either  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2167) either either not acting at all like the  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2170) aristotle's god who doesn't act  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2172) and the universe just uh the  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2175) action is all in the universe in in an  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2177) attempt to become like the divine  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2179) and this theory is obviously intelligent  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2181) trajectory has been deserted by  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2183) philosophers long ago  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2184) and defeated and the other one is that  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2187) the eternally existing universe is  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2189) acting by necessity and this acting by  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2191) necessity contracts the nature of the  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2193) universe  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2194) because it cannot explain the big bang  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2196) that don't explain the  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2197) free choice of initial parameters beside  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2199) it maybe  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2200) contradicts issues of necessity of  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2203) reason  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2204) but this need further elaboration there  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2206) may be possibility  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2207) just from the concept of necessarily  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2209) existing that necessarily existing  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2211) cannot be acting by necessity or by you  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2215) without choice cannot be a deafblind and  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2217) a dead  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2218) that contradicts the meaning of  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2220) necessarily existing but  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2222) in liberation of such an evidence of  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2224) divine proof which would be like  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2225) a further development of the so-called  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2227) ontological proof of  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2229) of uh saint anselm has not been  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2232) elaborated until now in a convincing way  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2234) yet  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2235) maybe someone will be able to elaborate  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2237) and develop further  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2239) and the other one an essentially  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2241) existing  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2243) uh being can act with absolute freedom  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2246) then he can act spontaneously with  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2248) absolute freedom and this is exactly  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2250) the only explanation of the universe  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2252) that it is created by a being which acts  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2255) with absolute freedom  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2257) and choose the initial parameters of  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2258) arbitrary as he wishes according to his  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2261) intention what he wants to do  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2263) that's by necessity there is no other  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2265) options either no action at all  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2267) and this has been refuted this is not  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2269) enough for the universe to work  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2271) and develop according to what the what  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2272) they this means their neighbors exist  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2274) eternally  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2275) under god etcetera which is an active is  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2277) just an an ideal and nervous development  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2279) to all that either  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2280) this is nonsense and this contradicts  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2282) the principle that the necessary  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2283) existing  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2284) beings cannot be two it's only one  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2287) one must exist but multiple cannot exist  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2289) so it's only one so this one cannot be  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2291) these two things  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2292) the same apply for the for the for the  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2295) uh for the  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2296) acting by necessity at least it  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2298) contradicts the current states of the  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2300) universe and that the initial parameters  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2302) have been chosen freely  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2303) so a nature a dead blind nature which  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2306) cannot choose cannot cannot initiate the  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2308) universe that's not possible  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2310) so that's not possible based on the  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2312) cosmological evidence  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2314) not on intrinsic analysis of the concept  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2316) but it may be possible to establish it  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2318) by intrinsic and then we have an  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2319) absolute proof  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2320) which doesn't depend upon a big bang or  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2323) anything in the universe and i think  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2324) it's  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2324) it can be developed it seems to be  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2326) possible that it will be by deep  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2328) analysis of the concept of action and so  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2330) on  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2331) and secondly an agent who's act by  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2334) freedom and by choice  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2335) and that must be done by absolute  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2337) freedom necessarily it's not possible to  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2339) have  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2339) to have a to have the acting sometimes  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2341) disagree but by  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2342) the concept of necessarily existing and  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2345) and that's  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2346) dictate that essentially  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2349) this being made a decision to start time  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2352) start day and night start all the  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2353) development of the universe  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2355) and this means that the future is he may  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2358) have a  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2359) system established but within that  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2361) system the future is still open  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2363) developments can be going very well this  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2365) way or this way  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2366) but the development in the future is is  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2369) completely under his control he knows  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2370) what possibilities at every moment  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2372) he knows at the beginning of the  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2374) eternity he knows which universes are  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2376) possible and he shows one of them  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2377) why that's another issue but that's his  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2379) cuddle this choice you have to accept it  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2381) not accepted  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2382) if you want to depart the universe with  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2384) commission side it's not going to change  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2386) anything  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2387) that is the choice has been done you  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2388) have to accept it  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2392) secondly every at every moment of time  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2395) he is fully aware what the possibilities  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2397) next moment and next  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2399) days and next months and next years if  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2401) they're still  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2402) and he permits whatever to happen and he  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2404) can enter  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2405) and prevent a certain development from  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2407) happening which would have happened  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2408) otherwise  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2409) he has a complete control of the  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2410) universe nothing happens without  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2413) without his permission so he's have the  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2414) complete dominance of the universe  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2417) and all what's happening is with his  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2419) permission that's that's the  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2421) the that's also but so there's no cover  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2423) in the sense that's all  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2425) if you for example make a decision on  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2427) that  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2428) inshallah when the pandemic is over i  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2430) will collect money as well  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2431) next year i will go for hajj hajj will  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2433) be available  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2435) and then you would indeed perform hajj  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2438) that does not mean that this had been  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2440) known or decided but the possibility was  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2442) there and they're not also  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2444) there there would be people who who will  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2446) be performing hajj and so on  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2448) who will be performing what's the time  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2450) this will be decided on time  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2452) and otherwise you will have that  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2455) really contradictions in the quran in in  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2457) a necessity of these the quran also  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2459) quran refuted that that it for example  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2462) when i was  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2462) about they say this means that divine  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2464) knowledge changes  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2466) he knew something i knew something will  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2468) happen in the future when it happens  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2470) he knows that it happened they say the  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2472) knowledge just changed in that  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2474) no there's a change there's definitely  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2476) when the quran said that's clearly  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2478) when you  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2493) he knows who knows what not that it has  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2494) fallen not before that he knew that it  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2497) will fall he knew that it will fall  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2499) but when it falls he knows that it has  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2501) fallen now so it is in the past  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2503) has happened so based on that  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2507) the absolute time which has not  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2509) necessarily the exact physical time  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2510) which we have on earth for  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2512) issues with the germans and so on but  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2514) absolutely term of the universe  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2516) is essentially an expression of allah's  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2520) action  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2521) and this has also an implication that  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2523) any theory which does not have an  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2525) absolute time  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2526) like for example the theory of  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2528) creativity cannot be really  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2530) the complete description it's just from  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2532) logically look at the theory of the  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2534) traits here  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2534) the time is relative relative to what  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2536) they say to an initial system  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2538) say is somehow uh fixed in in in  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2542) in the remote starts so it's relative to  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2545) something else  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2547) there cannot be absolute creativity  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2549) there's nothing coming up relative to  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2550) nothing to relative it must end somehow  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2552) to unabsolute  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2554) so so the current theory of relativity  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2557) is a description for phenomena in the  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2559) earth maybe good description  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2561) but it cannot describe the whole  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2562) universe completely while the  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2564) theory of quantum theory with its  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2566) absolute time there's an unfair time  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2568) convo theory is more close to that and  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2570) that's the reason it is the more correct  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2572) theory and any  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2573) in any competition between the theories  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2574) in certain situation  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2576) uh it has been proven now even  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2578) experimentally observationally  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2579) not experimentally that the conclusion  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2582) of an absolute relativity  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2584) uh ala gravitation theory has been  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2587) refuted by certain observation it can it  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2589) can't  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2589) it's not so it's it's not sufficient and  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2592) itself to generate the initial  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2593) parameters but independent of that  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2595) it's not sufficient to uh to describe  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2598) certain phenomena  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2598) extreme phenomena in quasars and so on  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2601) while this quantum  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2602) theory has passed this so there must be  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2605) some kind of a reversal time  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2607) there may be a problem for physics to  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2609) connect there is a time with our local  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2611) times and so on this is an issue which  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2612) had been done by  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2613) can be settled by measurements and by by  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2616) here by  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2617) request to issues of this type of  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2620) scientific type but there's an absolute  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2622) time in the universe and this absolute  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2624) time is just an expression of the divine  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2627) the humans heard me they say  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2631) by saying what a miserable time  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2634) war on the time cares the time cares  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2636) these days  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2638) and i am the time the eons  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2653) giving an example of how the expression  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2655) of the action manifests  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2656) because people usually connected the  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2658) passage of time with day and night but  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2660) it's not necessarily about  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2661) but any activity of allah in the  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2663) universe even by  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2664) by by frequencies around the atom that's  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2667) also a measure of time  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2668) he is the one controlling and attaining  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2670) it the one who set it  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2672) to start with in a certain system that's  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2674) cutter and it's running accordingly  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2676) until you're  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2677) until the end of the world or for  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2678) eternities according to the system  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2681) and any moment is still under divine  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2683) control he can change it he can twist it  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2685) he can bring it forward bring it  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2686) backward  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2688) and he does sometimes in in in in  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2690) supernatural way if as evidence of his  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2692) profits and so on but this is another  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2694) secondary issue  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2695) because it's under his control so the  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2697) nationalistic point of view this is  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2699) impossible this miracles are impossible  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2700) because the national country broken is  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2702) based on the fact that nature is  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2704) necessarily existing but we have refuted  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2706) that by the big bang and i've refuted  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2708) that by all of these things this is  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2710) reputed this is finished i'm gone  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2711) this is not possible so nature is not  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2714) just executing it's contingent  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2716) it's under allah's control yes he fixed  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2718) it at the beginning of it  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2720) in a certain way but in the future he  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2721) can undermine it and reverse it in  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2723) certain situation  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2725) perfectly without any any any any  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2728) there's no power of him preventing him  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2730) from doing that  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2731) if he wants and sometimes he doesn't  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2733) sometimes he doesn't know  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2735) doesn't want that's depending upon his  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2737) will and opening  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2738) in the objective condition the time as  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2740) he decides and perceive not as we wish  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2743) and  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2743) and imagine  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2747) so that's that's that's how how to  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2749) understand really the passage of time  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2751) and the events in the universe which fit  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2752) through the quran  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2754) consistently everywhere so all these  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2756) other theories will not fit to the quran  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2758) they rely on either a bit of ayah or a  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2760) bit of statement  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2761) or an imaginary uh statement like  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2764) whatever has events in himself is by  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2766) himself as an event or created not  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2769) intended that's not true  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2770) this can't be because if you divide the  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2772) necessary existing being either the one  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2774) who is not acting at all which cannot  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2775) exist  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2776) because the universe is action so it can  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2778) be so universe must be another  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2780) and the universe since for allah  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2783) what he called god is just a mover the  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2786) one who moves everything  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2787) doesn't move himself this one cannot  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2789) exist with an  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2790) athena universe both countries because  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2792) two necessarily accessible beings cannot  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2794) exist  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2794) by necessity of reason and the proof of  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2796) that is the book of taheed for example  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2798) but the philosopher finished that long  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2800) ago and abandoned that point of view  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2802) a second one is that a necessarily  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2805) existing being who's act by  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2807) by by necessity will not at least at  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2809) this level of our knowledge will not  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2811) synchronize with the universe because  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2813) the universe has to be  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2815) based on the choice of a chooser so  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2818) what they call nature or matter and so  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2820) on which is acting by the system  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2822) by internal laws without having a mind  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2824) or a will or the intention or anything  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2826) like that  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2826) it's impossible to explain the universe  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2828) but it may be impossible in itself  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2830) based on analysis of the concept of  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2832) action that will be an intriguing area  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2834) where people  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2835) who are working the orthological proof  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2837) of god uh  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2838) may may develop shall go and start  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2841) developing  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2843) in addition to the attempts have been  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2844) made and we have the attempt of saint  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2846) anselm  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2847) we have attempted gordon godel the  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2849) famous uh  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2850) uh mathematician and uh the one who has  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2853) the famous goddess theory  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2854) about uh incompleteness of the number  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2858) theory and all these things this is the  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2859) ingenious man he has also an ontological  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2862) proof which seems to be quite solid  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2864) but there may be still objections about  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2866) some points of it but this is very  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2867) technical  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2868) and the third one is a necessarily  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2870) existing being which is absolutely free  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2872) and spontaneous  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2873) absolutely free there's impossible for  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2876) to be in a condition dictating to him to  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2878) do what not to do  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2879) he could have chosen to here to this  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2882) universe another  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2883) he could have chosen not to create or to  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2885) create that's absolutely free there's  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2887) nothing we should  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2888) compel him to do either one of them he's  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2890) not under compulsion  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2891) he's absolutely free that's the one that  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2895) will fit then with the theory of qatar  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2897) as we explained and fit with the quran  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2899) and does not fit with these claims of of  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2902) those who claim that  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2903) allah knew that xy will choose to go to  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2905) hajj in that you know  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2907) before the creation of the no it's not  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2909) allah there it will be possibilities  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2910) then there will be maybe a possible  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2912) person called muhammad al-masari and you  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2915) in due course  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2916) this what materializes this way are not  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2918) authorized the other way  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2921) and one of the strongest points which  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2923) support that is is  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2925) not only that the knowledge changes as  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2927) uh  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2928) well we will come to that but one of the  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2931) strongest things you know  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2932) points with which we enforce that is  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2935) the eye about those who have been  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2938) uh have been did not join the battle to  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2942) to the russell to going to the book in  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2944) swords and they didn't have any excuse  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2946) otherwise i said wait  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2949) don't don't cohabitate your wife etc  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2952) until  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2953) allah decides and they do not lie  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2981) either he will punish them or he forgive  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2983) them so  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2985) definitely at the moment with the  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2986) relation with the eyes where came  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2989) the decision was not made because  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2992) was born to the decision of allah he has  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2995) the choice either to forgive them  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=2997) well allah is exalted and wise  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3000) that's it which will be the decision  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3002) will be later  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3003) not now later the decision came so at  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3006) the moment of revelation  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3008) definitive decision was not made others  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3009) allah will be lying say if they are  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3011) postponed to the decision of allah  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3013) allah has not been made yet  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3016) by the way most scholars when they  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3019) expect except my non favorite of  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3022) korthovi  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3023) he mentioned this point he's the only  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3025) one mission that is actually the human  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3028) vision from human point of view  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3030) it is it is the but that's actually  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3032) because he is  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3033) he is jabari he is like more or less  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3036) believing that all of these things have  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3038) been decided for the creation of the  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3039) universe  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3040) so he got stuck there so he said this is  
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3042) from human vision from allah begins  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3043) definitely but what allah is telling us  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3045) telling us from his own vision what he  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3046) is doing  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3048) these are postponed to my command so the  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3050) command has not been made  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3052) the decision has not been made  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3056) it cannot be known before before even  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3058) that that one is not known what will  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3059) decision will be  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3060) because the decision has not been  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3061) immediate  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3064) if it is known then the decision is  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3067) imminent  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3068) no way if i know that i will decide this  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3069) way then he will not be able to  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3071) respond no i have already said i know  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3074) that it will be like i have no issues  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3076) if you say that allah has already knew  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3079) that he will  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3080) forgive them for example or punish them  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3083) then there is no nothing to be commanded  
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3085) it will happen  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3086) allah become the compulsion unable to  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3089) change his knowledge  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3091) otherwise his knowledge will be wrong  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3092) this will create infinite contradiction  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3095) accordingly try to escape from that by  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3097) saying actually  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3098) this is from a human vision point of  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3100) view not from allah's point of view this  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3102) is this is  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3102) this escape is not possible because  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3104) allah is talking about himself  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3107) and he's the one who is revealing  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3110) and also even even if we accept the  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3113) karthav at face value  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3115) expand us to say how it is from the your  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3117) view it will be like that  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3118) for allah you'll be like that it's  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3119) impossible there's no way to explain  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3121) read it again and again and  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3122) but though he's the only scholar even  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3127) when he came to that just mentioned that  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3128) there are people who have been postponed  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3130) and that they were forgiven later and so  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3132) on with that mention they should  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3134) although he discussed maybe he did not  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3136) want to go into this nightmare because  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3137) he discussed issue of cuddle early as  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3139) plenty  
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3140) and then was wavering in theater issues  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3142) and some places he stopped and  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3144) advanced a little bit and went backwards  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3146) etc and  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3148) did not want to indulge in further in  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3150) this problem anymore possibly  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3152) because he indulged in that quite often  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3154) and in many places he hints that  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3157) that there are problems but says we say  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3159) what our scholars say  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3160) in some places he escaped by joining  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3163) just the majority  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3164) and uh and the public and the jungle  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3167) obviously he did not have the courage to  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3169) pronounce something which is  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3170) but he has i think the mental capability  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3173) and and the sophistication to  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3175) uh to in some places to deviate from  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3177) that  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3178) at least in porsches did not buy the i  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3181) feel that he did not have the courage to  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3182) put things upside down  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3184) because that was so deep entrenched  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3185) after several centuries of ashari  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3187) developments and minimum  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3188) development that but in some places here  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3191) for example  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3192) in a measure of  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3207) it no so the knowledge can change and  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3209) this is the contradict that allah has  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3210) eternal  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3211) so there is even more who recognize that  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3213) the divine action  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3215) could be it could be new or  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3218) created or something like that but does  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3221) not negate that allah has  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3222) himself in his being eternal and this  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3224) isn't existing  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3227) so you see this is a bit of a deep point  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3229) but  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3232) if we go to huda even if meaning  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3235) guidance for allah  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3236) in the creative sense not in the  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3237) legislative sense not that what he has  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3239) revealed but it creates it  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3240) then we have to interpret it this way  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3242) the guidance here meaning  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3244) is that if you needed a creative sense  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3247) they would not have been guided because  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3249) allah has guided them  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3251) meaning the system of difference have  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3253) been said like this  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3255) and the choices have been syrian that  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3257) everyone  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3258) human being has the choice and has  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3261) enough  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3262) capability and enough mental capability  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3264) and enough  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3265) free generally free will so he can  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3268) choose the guidance and this would have  
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3269) not been the case  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3271) if allah did not allow to be like that  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3272) is by originally creating reverse this  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3275) way  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3276) and by allowing this to happen this  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3278) situation this way  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3283) which is correct that's correct but who  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3285) who  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3286) who accepted the guidance and and  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3288) advanced on the way of guidance  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3289) the one who has guided himself allah did  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3292) not force him  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3293) but allah allowed it to happen to heaven  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3296) according to his own arc  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3297) and this is clear in the this is this we  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3299) are talking about madina now this is  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3303) the second year third year first year  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3304) around that time already in mecca  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3307) the issue was very clear clear for  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3308) example  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3315) who has given from his money  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3332) and guaranteed it by by  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3336) we did not compel anyone to to accept or  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3338) reject  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3340) so that's what all the issues of qatar  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3342) will play  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3343) there are there is a hadith who seem to  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3344) be contradicting that but these hadith  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3346) are faulty and  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3347) contradictory we have i have collected  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3350) all of those and discussed them and  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3352) expanded on them uh the most famous one  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3355) is is the one which  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3356) is usually quoted often like i said that  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3360) after  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3360) 40 40 40 the verb sadies of sadhakal  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3363) must know  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3365) an angel comes in in the womb and say my  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3367) lord is it  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3368) and as you see from the method it's  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3370) impossible after 40 and 1440 muslims is  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3373) also a mistake  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3374) which shows you that hadith is faulty  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3376) the the the wording of the hadith  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3377) another hadith after 40 or 41 or 42 so  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3381) the narrator did not memorize probably  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3382) this abortion but anyway  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3384) and then he says my lord  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3387) command me is it a dakara wanted this is  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3390) the first one which you should object to  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3391) because the canon  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3392) has been already decided before the  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3394) movement of fertilization  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3395) we know that by necessity that's what  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3398) the current has decided before  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3400) so how can you say the quran so he did  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3402) said what are you done  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3417) the one or the only one narrating  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3420) and this shows that absolutely is not  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3422) reliable this  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3423) in this report and based on that we  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3426) should be questioned all his other  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3427) reports and  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3428) scrutinize them more thoroughly and i  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3430) did that in many other research  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3431) everywhere where we have narration from  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3433) oblivion from various  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3435) uh combat uh followers and students i  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3438) will mention  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3440) at the end to say but i don't know how  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3441) is not that reliable in his memory  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3443) because of this hadith  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3445) so that had this gave us a hint but he  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3447) was fooled by that hadith  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3448) and people think this is decided in the  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3450) one under one of the questions today  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3452) uh what is his age what's his life no  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3455) because  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3456) okay this is related to his genetic  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3458) predisposition and so on but even that  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3460) does not fix the age  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3461) hundred percent even your genetic  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3463) disposition give you an age that save a  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3465) hundred years  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3467) if you live a a certain a certain  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3469) healthy life but if you don't live a  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3471) healthy life it may be shortened  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3472) and also contradicts i said whoever want  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3476) to life history extent  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3478) and uh and his uh  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3481) and his children be blessed he should be  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3484) keep  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3484) good relation with the the nation of the  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3486) womb he should be kind to his next of  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3489) kin  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3490) so you can you can you can't change your  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3493) life you can't change your agile so this  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3495) is this is all  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3496) this is the whole basin this hadith is  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3498) all based on under  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3500) we have made also the books of hezbollah  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3502) says that the agile is fixed and only  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3504) the end of agile  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3505) is is but the idea actually is not fixed  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3508) other is dynamically  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3509) all with the permission also under  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3511) complete control of himself  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3513) and i mentioned also once in an was it  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3515) here in  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3516) in 0 elsewhere that we have of just  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3519) interesting story in the old testament  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3520) oh there's not an authority because we  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3522) don't know how accurately is the  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3524) written one but one of the kings was  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3526) involved by a prophet  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3527) get ready your life is ending so he's  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3530) supplicated  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3531) allah granted him 15 more years this is  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3533) the old testament  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3534) and that's the reason many of the  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3535) western scholars say this is this they  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3538) show the old theory of qatar that  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3540) everything is fixed unknown  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3541) before the creation of the universe is  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3543) not correct  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3544) or this cannot be correct according to  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3546) quran also and according to what we  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3547) mentioned about these  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3548) three who are the all these have been  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3550) postponed  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3551) and left to the decision of allah to  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3553) punish them will forgive them  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3555) when you know attained people they gave  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3556) them but  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3558) at the time of the revelation it was not  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3559) decided yet  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3562) so this hadith fault you should not  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3563) understand  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3565) it's not true it's not decided there it  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3568) decided later by his own action  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3573) i'll usually say that it's meaning  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3574) what's the probability and so on which  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3576) official what this is  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3578) saying he has all the features to  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3580) disappear officers to be saved  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3582) that's it and if he's mentally deficient  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3585) for example like mongols or  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3587) dow syndrome they are not responsible so  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3589) they are saying  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3590) we can say assume they are saved they  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3592) are excluded from this test anyway so  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3594) this is all  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3595) these hadith and so on are faulty but  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3597) what shows that they are so faulty that  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3598) there are other hadith which are better  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3600) is not  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3601) for example let me mention that before  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3602) closing today yeah  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3605) this is hadith very good excellent i  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3607) said  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3609) an explanation of uh or  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3621) a man doing good deeds  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3626) so as long as he is making good deeds  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3629) places are located in paradise for him  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3631) and buildings are made for him but then  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3634) this one deviates and become  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3636) dies a kafir  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3639) by his own choice so these buildings in  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3642) paradise  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3643) will be kept and given to someone else  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3645) who inherits it  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3647) and he mentioned the case of the  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3648) hellfire and the one who works works  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3651) works uh the action of hellfire so is a  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3654) location and housing in the hellfire is  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3656) allocated for him  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3659) but he embraces islam and become good  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3660) before dying  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3662) then his housing and place in the  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3664) hellfire will be destroyed because  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3665) nobody can inherit that  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3669) that he enters paradise maybe he  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3670) inherits from those who uh of us reside  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3672) before the death  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3674) beside what he has built for himself for  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3676) example  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3677) if you got opportunity to build usually  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3679) you get with the shahada you built  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3681) already a basic house there  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3682) with iman and if you get more time to do  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3685) more goodies then you build more and  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3686) then you can have maybe from other  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3687) people  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3689) so this hadith was much better  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3692) than hadith have you ever hit this  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3695) hadith any mentioning no  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3696) because all are stuck in this imaginary  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3699) theory of things everything has been  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3701) decided  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3701) at the beginning of universe because  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3703) they misunderstood hadith  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3705) it has been decided is makadi and is the  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3708) correct wording which is  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3709) narrated by muslim and the united  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3724) system of states he decided the system  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3728) of the universe that's what that'll be  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3729) decided  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3730) not what will happen that's open that's  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3732) developing dynamically  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3734) some of it depending upon physical  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3735) condition somebody with the action some  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3737) without  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3738) actually we may decide later to do or  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3741) not to do  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3742) all of them is these three who have been  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3744) forgiven later but at the moment of the  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3746) revelation  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3747) they were postponed  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3752) noticing was made  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3770) that's all that's meaning the future is  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3772) open  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3773) it's not closed  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3777) that's the open future uh theory of uh  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3782) the future is open the past is gone and  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3785) done fetish closed  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3787) you don't mock elementation but does not  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3789) prevent you from studying in the past  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3791) why did this happen what were the  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3793) condition there could they have  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3794) could we change the condition for the  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3796) future to benefit from the future  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3798) yes that's perfectly and that's what's  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3800) the guidance and surat  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3802) uh insult ali imran khan saying the  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3804) catastrophe  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3805) clearly says you have disputed under  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3807) yourself and disobeyed your commander  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3809) they said the messenger  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3810) and you want to dunya you wanted mooty  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3813) instead of waiting and  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3814) the body will be distributed don't worry  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3816) that what you would ever want to get is  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3817) here what if there's anybody  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3819) and they ended with that calamity nobody  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3821) and loss of 70 lives  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3828) clearly if there is an instruction in  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3829) allah measure this  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3831) avoid in the future to do the same  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3832) mistake otherwise the same will happen  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3836) but without having house gone forget  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3838) about it now look forward  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3840) learn from it look forward don't open a  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3842) lamentation  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3845) always say in arabic love me slap  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3847) yourself and weep and  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3848) and cry forever no no it's called harass  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3851) if  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3852) any then study what are the rightful  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3853) condition what was the mistake how we  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3855) can improve it  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3856) for the future it is okay i should say  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3860) if we have done that it would have been  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3861) like that that says okay this is that if  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3863) then else that's clear this is the quran  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3865) is using it  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3866) furthermore i was fulfilling his  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3867) problems to you you were succeeding  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3869) but then you were disputed you did not  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3871) obey and then you got a calamity  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3873) meaning if you have not done that it  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3876) wouldn't happen like that but you did it  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3878) so  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3878) don't do it in the future but don't  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3881) indulge in them  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3883) and they say clearly  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3888) it doesn't happen against allah allah is  
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3889) not defeated he is completely sovereign  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3891) he could have stepped in with a miracle  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3893) and preventing that that he did not step  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3897) to give you a lesson or to have to adopt  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3899) shahadah from you whatever  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3901) reason he has right not to stabbing  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3904) and even it came to the extreme that the  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3905) lord almost was killed  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3907) injured and there was a rumor that he  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3909) was killed that was also a good  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3910) opportunity to reach the people  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3912) i said how much just a messenger like  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3914) enemies if he is die if he dies  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3916) or get killed are you going to turn away  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3917) from the revelation  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3920) he's a messenger like any other  
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3921) messenger all of them came and died and  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3923) went  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3924) is that an excuse to turn away from the  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3925) under and under opposite eyes no that's  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3927) not an excuse we should continue on the  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3929) same path  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3931) let me see you have a limited life he's  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3933) going to die even he was with you today  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3935) obviously  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3936) allah will not allow him to be with it  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3938) there because still the message has to  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3939) be completed has not completed yet  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3941) it will be complete in the future and  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3943) protected him whatever kind potentially  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3944) he did  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3945) specifically for him otherwise he would  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3947) have been killed situation became dire  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3951) so if we study that carefully we study  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3952) that carefully we  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3954) and discount all these theories all  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3956) these nonsense that  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3957) allah the knowledge of allah cannot  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3960) change but it  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3961) does change you know it's a change in  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3963) the sense that  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3964) this something which is going to happen  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3967) with certainty allah knows it will going  
[1:06:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3968) to happen  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3969) when it happens allah know it has  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3970) happened it's happening now and when it  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3973) has completed our knowledge it has been  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3976) completed  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3978) the correct one so  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3981) you see the this this point of  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3984) him doesn't mean allah the first the  
[1:06:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3986) first explanation is symbol this is an  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3988) obligation of qatar they are in the  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3989) guidance as refused by the  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3991) lord that's the guidance which is given  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3992) through the prophets they combined with  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3994) it and they are on it they are on the  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3996) path on that path which has been  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3997) revealed  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=3997) it's not only just but if it's made  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4000) they are guided by the lord and he  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4002) created the guidance  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4004) and the right condition of goddess  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4005) indeed in the sense of qatar as we have  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4007) explained  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4008) not instance of cover of ashari who is  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4012) essentially jabber  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4013) which is really compulsion is incredible  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4016) if all that is known that this guy will  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4018) embrace islam this guy will not  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4019) immediately if he is known before the  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4021) creation  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4022) than it is that's then it is impossible  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4025) for all of this to be true  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4026) and the two you have the never in the  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4027) contradiction and the the choice does  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4029) not make any sense  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4031) and even allah become bound by his own  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4034) previous knowledge and become then  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4035) acting by necessity and  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4036) contradict the fact that he is a free  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4038) agent absolutely free and sovereign  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4041) and this is the most fundamental aspect  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4042) of allah that's the one which explained  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4045) the universe  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4045) coming into existence that he's  
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4047) absolutely free  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4049) he cannot be wound by anything and not  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4051) even by his own knowledge  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4053) so the knowledge follow that at the  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4055) religious part of qatar he's capable of  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4057) knowledge  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4058) this is part of kodak but not something  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4061) similar  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4062) not something by itself he is capable of  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4065) knowing what's going on  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4066) what's happening in the past already  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4068) known and put what and in eternity  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4070) before creation he knew what are the  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4072) possible universes there  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4073) and he made the show that choice you  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4075) have to accept it there's no escape  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4078) there's no escape that's that's  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4080) intrinsically because  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4081) and that choice is wise from his point  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4083) of view and wise according to  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4085) the feature that is necessarily existing  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4087) perfect being  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4089) so that choice is good  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4092) but it's any choice that's history it's  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4093) good or bad this is  
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4095) you you will graduate it's his choice  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4097) that's in the shadow  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4098) you have to accept it there's no escape  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4100) from it there's no way you can exit the  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4101) universe i know you can change that  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4103) choice  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4104) so we have to accept that that's that's  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4107) what  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4107) and you have please please do that and  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4109) you have to live within that  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4111) the other alternative is what to do  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4112) commit suicide okay go ahead commit  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4114) suicide  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4116) but they some people some atheists say  
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4119) we have a better alternative no you  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4120) don't have better  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4121) you have a necessary necessary a nature  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4124) or a matter working  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4125) and interacting by necessity and it's  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4128) working like a  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4129) vicious machine from eternity to  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4130) eternity you like it you don't like it  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4132) as universe as it is it's because of  
[1:08:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4134) this  
[1:08:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4135) allegiant matter doing that by necessity  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4137) you cannot change anything like that  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4140) if you don't like it commit suicide also  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4143) nothing nothing will  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4145) so even the atheists have a cuddle which  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4148) they cannot escape  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4150) even if they fool themselves no they  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4151) can't escape and when claim they can't  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4153) escape i can't change  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4154) then they attribute to himself an  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4156) ability a will  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4158) which is not warranted by the system of  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4160) the universe it's just  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4161) that will your will your alleged will is  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4163) most likely  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4164) uh uh an internal delusion  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4168) there's no guarantee that this will is a  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4169) free will how come that you have free  
[1:09:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4172) will and the whole universe is  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4173) mechanical  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4174) this is not very convincing  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4177) but allah is getting universe giving you  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4180) these features  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4180) guarantee that the will is genuinely a  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4182) genuine will and it's  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4184) and you have a free will so  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4187) freedom is the one who guarantees your  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4189) freedom this is a free agent it will  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4191) guarantee that your freedom is genuine  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4192) and he is capable of creating a universe  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4194) in which you have a genuine  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4196) free will a general capability of action  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4199) and the general responsibility and  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4201) that's what the situation is under the  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4203) quran indicated everywhere indicate  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4204) anything else all these theory about the  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4207) claiming that  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4208) that any the other statement might  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4209) undermine allah knowledge  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4212) that minds all your knowledge about  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4214) allah  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4216) mistaken this is not the correct one the  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4220) correct one is what the quran says  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4221) clearly  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4223) the quran expressed unto necessity of  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4224) reason dictates clearly otherwise  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4227) what's the meaning of saying allah is a  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4228) free agent he could have created or not  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4231) created  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4233) if he must have created that and he is  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4234) his acting minister there's no reason  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4236) if he has acted by the system there is  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4238) no reason to say he's a conscious being  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4240) he's a free agent he has will he has  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4242) knowledge because nature is dead  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4245) acting by necessity there is no need for  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4246) to oscillate any knowledge for nation  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4248) there is nothing in the nation  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4249) indicate that that they had that they  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4251) have any kind of interesting knowledge  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4253) it's just a mechanism working  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4257) if you look at that mechanical point of  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4258) view like the asus will look  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4260) and any being which seem to be have a  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4262) free event it is it's just just a  
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4264) delusion you are diluted actually you  
[1:11:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4266) don't have a genuine free will  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4268) but yeah you delude yourself that agree  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4270) for you that's it there's no evidence  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4272) there are no compelling evidence that  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4273) in in an atheist frame that the human  
[1:11:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4276) free will is a genuinely free will  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4278) you could have chosen this or  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4279) controlling otherwise no  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4282) you could not have it just appear to you  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4284) like that because you are deluded  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4287) so the atheists also have the so if if  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4290) what's his name the guy we say i wrote  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4292) the the god delusion  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4294) his name now at the moment he has also  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4298) his writing is actually he's deluded to  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4301) think he could have written otherwise no  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4302) no  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4303) it could not have been it's nature  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4305) dictating to you and this is just  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4306) so you are also deluded your delusion is  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4308) based on delusion  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4310) it was a never-ending delusion you can't  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4313) rely on anything  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4315) but the only way to rely on that's what  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4317) we know and that we our free will is  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4319) sufficiently we are sufficiently able to  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4321) to make a decision  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4323) and otherwise decide otherwise it's  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4325) based on that that's  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4327) came with this capability for certain  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4329) beings  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4331) and gave them his capability that's the  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4333) only guarantee for that and he has this  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4334) absolute capability of our freedom  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4338) that's that's that's the only only way  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4340) but it's just a summary  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4342) i'm writing something insha'allah  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4343) collecting all the hadith i would say  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4346) narration are mostly faulty and and and  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4350) don't stand in this country and the ayat  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4352) are very clear they are contradicting  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4353) that and the necessity of reason is  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4355) dictating the otherwise  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4356) so all of that i think is is should be  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4358) regarded as considerably  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4360) well established and settled and we can  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4363) forgo about the claim of the ashari and  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4365) all these things that's that's all does  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4368) not stand any  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4369) rational or any quranic scrutiny okay i  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4372) think  
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4373) this is enough for today we will see if  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4374) there's any questions  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4376) and you see this one where the quran  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4378) opened doors but we  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4380) took guidance from other places of the  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4381) quran and also the necessities of reason  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4384) and the analysis of the concepts and the  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4386) meaning of concepts  
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4389) okay so we we stop here for today  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4393) and uh just it's almost  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4396) certain that next week we'll have no  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4398) helicopter because we will be visiting  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4400) myself and shazad  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4401) visiting someone in sheffield so next  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4404) sunday  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4405) after that will be two or three days  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4407) after i either  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4409) yeah okay  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4412) no questions have come through yeah  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4416) inshallah we will we'll we'll try to get  
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4417) all of these things in in one  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4419) in one uh three pieces uh which i think  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4423) will be you  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4424) well it will be crucial we will we'll  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4426) get all of these things  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4427) but in islamic history by the way there  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4429) have been also  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4430) uh people discussing that and bringing  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4432) convenience we say arguments against the  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4434) ashari and against  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4435) hadith and and there have been in  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4438) between positions  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4451) and things like that trying to escape  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4453) that actually is only the one  
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4456) because he confused her with kala again  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4458) that there is only down the beginning of  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4459) the universe  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4460) the system has been chosen and let go  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4463) then with the initial conditions  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4465) after that it is it is it is no new  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4468) technique in the sense that  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4469) there is already the system is already  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4471) in place is only the action of allah the  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4473) action of free agents  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4475) and with everything under allah control  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4478) so this is it will be there may be yes  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4481) there could be a kala for example allah  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4482) may make a quran  
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4484) in in ramadan for example that someone  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4486) will die during the year for whatever  
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4487) reason was that  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4489) although he could have possibly not died  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4491) but allah decided that he would differ  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4492) for that  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4493) reason for example there will be fitna  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4494) coming and this is a good worshiper  
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4496) and this worshiper is weak inside  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4498) respect if the fitna will come  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4500) which is coming individually because of  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4501) certain constellation of the  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4503) international relation the local  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4504) relation and so on  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4506) if it comes he may waiver so allah out  
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4509) of mercy decide  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4510) that he should die before that and die  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4512) in an example that's that's that's  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4513) that's within allah's capability  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4515) but it's not known before the beginning  
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4517) of the universe no it is open it's one  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4519) of the contingency which is  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4520) inherit in the classical universe and  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4522) things like that  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4523) so that also has to be the hadith  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4527) what happens uh like abbas says  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4531) a man is marrying and so on he doesn't  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4533) know that he will not reach this next  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4535) month  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4535) he's already decided that he will die on  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4537) radar it may have it may be like that  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4539) it may be very well for whatever is  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4540) allah has happened  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4546) that's that's uh that's what we uh and  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4549) that's very easy to do that follows  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4551) it doesn't need even to do it  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4552) miraculously just daily we have every  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4555) second we have millions of maybe not  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4558) millions  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4559) yes maybe millions of cancer cells  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4560) emerging in the body and the immune  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4562) system getting rid of them  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4563) although allah needs just to let one of  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4565) these get away without being  
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4567) handed by a new system that develops  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4569) into a cancer and you are gone before  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4571) next year  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4572) if allah has decided that for some  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4573) reason sometimes there is a mercy for  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4575) you  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4576) for the one who is dying it doesn't  
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4577) appear like a mercy but because he  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4579) doesn't know but  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4580) it could be like that it could be very  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4582) well like that  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4585) yeah so that's what the all of these  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4588) things are  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4589) within allah controls what he decides  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4592) not only in ramadan not only in germany  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4594) with shabbat according to  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4596) hadith not only in the womb every time  
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4598) every moment he can make decision for  
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4600) the  
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4600) coming phase of let things go  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4604) prevent him from happening step in with  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4606) something for example this pandemic  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4610) it could have image could not have  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4611) imaged maybe the first one infected  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4613) allah said let them go and let it become  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4615) a pandemic for certain reasons  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4618) allah could have stabbed and prevented  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4619) that like many other people have been  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4621) affected by this  
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4622) it's not it's not arbitrary it's for our  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4624) knowledge and permission  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4626) that's important is with knowledge and  
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4628) permission it's not arbitrary it's just  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4630) someone who inflicted just  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4631) just by accident that will fit in an  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4634) atheist universe but not in  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4635) in our vision of the universe  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4638) and so on and so on anyway that's that's  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4640) needs really a complete treatise in  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4642) which all these  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4642) hadith which have spoiled the people's  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4644) mind are  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4646) are classified as weak and analyzed and  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4649) refuted  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4650) then the eyes are synchronized under  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4652) this necessities of reason based on the  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4654) fundamental  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4655) well established uh the attributes of  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4657) the divine and the tribute sources the  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4659) most important  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4661) that he is a free agent that's the  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4663) founder that's he's a god  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4664) creator he's not a dead nature he's not  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4667) acting by necessity or or  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4669) like like i did methylation which is  
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4670) impossible because this that's cannot  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4672) extend the universe and maybe it's  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4674) impossible in itself  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4675) if uh future and as may show he is  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4678) absolutely free  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/m722n0ZG3uE?t=4679) sovereign agent does what that wants
