* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=2400)* Discusses the importance of following God's commandments and accepting His prophets.

* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=2700)** discusses the importance of remembrance of Allah and how breaking a covenant with Him can lead to heart hardness. He goes on to say that the Quran specifies the borders of Israel and how the jubilee year is a year of freedom and cancelling of debts for the Israelites. concludes by saying that many Muslims have forgotten about these things, and that the 70-year period mentioned in the Quran is to compensate for all of the times Muslims have broken their covenants with Allah.

He also says that the atheists are masters of deception and that they are unable to move the general masters except by this way.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=3300)* Discusses the concept of "postmodernism," and how it leads to the belief that what we believe is ultimately what matters. The professor goes on to discuss how this concept is applied to the Islamic faith, and how there is a fundamental contradiction between what some Muslims believe and what is written in the Quran. He concludes the video by saying that while postmodernism may be a "relatively new" phenomenon, it has led to the fragmentation of the Muslim community and the increased animosity between those who adhere to traditional Islamic beliefs and those who do not.

 Professor Dr. Muhammad al Massari discusses his analysis of the Qur'an. He argues that clear statements in the Qur'an support the idea that Prophet Muhammad was a great prophet of God, even after the so-called Crusades and crucifixion. He also discusses the history of sectarianism in Islam, noting that it has only gotten worse since the Qur'an was first revealed. Professor Massari concludes by urging Muslims to take the Qur'an and Sunnah (the Prophet's teachings) as a whole, rather than dissecting them piecemeal.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=3600)**  introduces Professor Dr. Muhammad al Massari and discusses his analysis of the Qur'an. He argues that clear statements in the Qur'an support the idea that Prophet Muhammad was a great prophet of God, even after the so-called Crusades and crucifixion. He also discusses the history of sectarianism in Islam, noting that it has only gotten worse since the Qur'an was first revealed. Professor Massari concludes by urging Muslims to take the Qur'an and Sunnah (the Prophet's teachings) as a whole, rather than dissecting them piecemeal.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=3900)** discusses the importance of understanding the Quran in order to properly follow ALLAH. He explains that there are two eyes to understanding the Quran - the literal and the spiritual. The literal eye sees the letter of the Quran, while the spiritual eye sees the message. goes on to say that even though the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is alive, the Quran is still self-explanatory. It is up to the individual to approach ALLAH in a proper way in order to gain his pleasure.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=4200)** Sheikh Massari discusses the concept of Ijma and how it applies to the split among Sunni Muslims. He goes on to say that the claim of being closer to the truth or having a better understanding of Islam is not sanctioned by Islam, and that all of these factions have some fundamental deficiencies.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=4500)* Discusses how the term "Ishmael" has crept into the Islamic community, and how it can be a source of division. Dr. Muhammad Al Massari argues that the term is not relevant to the Islamic faith, and that it should be abandoned in favor of a more complete understanding of Allah.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=4800)**  Professor Dr. Muhammad AL MASSARI discusses the various opinions on Surat Al Ma'idah. He notes that while there is agreement on some points, there are also disagreements. He goes on to say that, in his opinion, the momentum behind the reconstruction of the mosque is not clear, and that there are many counter-examples to the claim that there is widespread agreement on the matter. He finishes the video by emphasizing the importance of evidence-based Islamic discourse.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=5100)**  explores the theory of governance according to the hadith, which emphasises the importance of respecting the ruler and obeying his orders even if they are mistreated or one's rights are violated. The argument is made that unless one can see clear evidence of a ruler's wrongdoings, it is not worth challenging or protesting against him.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=5400)** promotes the idea that there is no divinity of Christ or atonement in the Bible, and that all of this is enforced by scripture but is at least justified by looking at the overall context.  also discusses the idea that all humans are created over a long chain from dust, and that all of this is created by God.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQl8h10_hWk&t=5700)** discusses some of the issues that were raised in last week's tafseer ul Quran class, including contracts and economics. He suggests that a separate session be held to discuss these topics in more detail. Finally, he provides a reference point for those who need it.

[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=81) uh surat al-maidah we are starting from  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=84) ayah 7 this week  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=104) and always remember the blessings of  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=106) which god has bestowed upon you and the  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=108) solemn pledge by which he bound you to  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=110) himself when you said  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=113) we have not we have heard and we pay  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=115) heed hence remain conscious of god  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=119) verily god has full knowledge of what is  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=121) in the hearts of men  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=122) next translation always remember god's  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=125) grace on you and your pledge that bites  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=127) you to him when you said we here and we  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=130) obey  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=131) always be mindful of god god is fully  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=133) aware of what you what is in your hearts  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=138) let us uh  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=139) just a conclusion that allah is  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=140) following your heart sector is not a  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=142) correct translation is it that what's  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=144) inside the chests  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=146) now let us  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=147) go a little bit i think we mentioned  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=148) that passport is repeated again  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=151) uh  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=152) the word chest sudden  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=154) and the white heart is used  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=156) both for the people confuse that with  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=158) the physical chest and the physical  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=159) heart  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=160) the physical heart is essentially the  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=162) center of  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=163) mindfulness which  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=165) contains all aspects of rationality of  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=169) thinking of memory of perceiving of also  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=172) feelings that's the center that's the  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=175) culp  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=176) or the loop  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=177) which is the mindfulness the mind  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=180) this is not a physical that's the reason  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=182) you find sometimes discussion on going  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=184) ah the quran talks about the heart and  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=185) so on uh it is actually not in the brain  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=187) it is the heart this is all nonsense  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=189) don't don't waste your time with these  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=190) these are time wasters exactly like  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=192) those who are advocating the flat earth  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=194) and exhale these are mentally segmented  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=197) just ignore them the culp there is the  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=199) is the metaphysical or the spiritual  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=202) heart uh heart  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=203) the chest  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=204) is where the curve is centered the chest  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=207) is where knowledge is accumulated you  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=209) could say this is the hard disk that's  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=210) the remember the heart of the cpu and  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=212) the chest is the uh  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=215) is the hard disk it's where memories and  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=217) information is is is recorded and  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=219) and that's the reason when we see the  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=221) hadith when we hear this  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=224) about  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=226) that they read the quran but doesn't go  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=227) down their throat what does it mean go  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=229) their down throat  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=232) in time past in my younger years i was  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=234) mentioning what what does it mean well  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=235) why do you think they'll throw that the  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=237) meaning of going down the throat they  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=238) don't digest it so it go down here  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=241) in the chest or in the belly so it  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=243) becomes useful information usable by the  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=245) heart  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=248) so these these metaphors have to be  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=250) always kept in our mind so allah knows  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=253) what inside the chest not only the the  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=254) state of the heart but also the the  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=256) accumulated information and knowledge so  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=258) the transition within the house is not a  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=260) good it should be in the chests even if  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=262) they don't like it because they sound  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=264) odd  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=265) in english you say what's in the heart  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=267) yeah the people will understand that  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=268) they have also the metaphorical or the  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=270) spiritual heart but they don't have the  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=272) spiritual chest but in arabic we have  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=274) that and it makes very good sense  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=276) because you are not talking only about  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=278) the cpu we're talking about the  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=279) accumulated information and so on so  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=281) allah is aware about and if he's aware  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=283) about what is in the chest are you put  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=284) of what all in the just including the  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=286) heart the heart is part inside the chest  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=288) that's all spiritual and metaphorical  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=291) and  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=292) in in the in the metaphorical sense not  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=295) in the physical sense that has that to  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=296) do that as if you read the quran you are  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=299) not going to digest it you're not going  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=300) to get it in your stomach you're not  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=302) going to add acids and and in enzymes so  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=305) this is all clearly is not the case  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=307) evidently obviously but still some  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=309) people are still stuck there and some of  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=311) you say let us see these they have been  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=313) half transplant in south africa starting  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=314) i think with this famous physician in  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=316) the 70s and then they were checking if  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=318) the guy who received the heart has his  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=320) character has chained he has not changed  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=322) if you want to change this collector to  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=323) another person you have to transplant  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=325) the brain which is obviously not  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=327) feasible maybe will never be feasible  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=329) so that's it thinking and so on is done  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=331) in the brain physically but that's not  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=333) an issue the issue is that what is the  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=335) meaning of these things so just remind  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=336) that the sensation is not accurate but  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=339) it's well intended they meant really  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=341) they meant really what's what's inside  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=343) yourself your your your  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=345) rationality your your mindfulness your  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=348) your feelings and also your information  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=350) and knowledge allah is aware all over  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=352) the world  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=355) within that  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=356) so that i said he remaining after the  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=358) ayah of  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=359) that has been in accident junction have  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=361) been enacted to to  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=364) to not to make your life difficult but  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=366) to make it easier on you and that's the  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=367) reason that in the case water is missing  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=369) you can use the dust or symbolically hit  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=372) your hand you know on a clean dust area  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=374) or even on the wall as i have described  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=376) last time uh  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=377) of course the misconception of this some  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=379) people have such a dull brain and and  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=384) materialistic point of view that they  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=385) they even some some have having videos  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=387) saying that dust is proven to be  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=389) antibacterial and things like this all  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=391) nonsense because as a matter of fact  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=392) even if it is you go to a dusty ground  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=395) and you strike your hands towards them  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=396) used to wipe the hadith and blow in them  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=399) so that is gone it is purely symbolic  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=401) act so you keep have in mind having that  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=403) there is a ritual  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=406) there is  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=407) there's a ritual purity which you have  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=410) to stick to it which is done usually  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=412) with water but substituted substituted  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=415) with with the uh  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=417) with the with this symbolic act of  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=419) striking of a clean and pure dust and as  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=422) i said you can strike the wall so allah  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=424) does not make your life difficult you  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=426) want to purify you and improve you and  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=428) this is part of the improvement that the  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=430) purification should be done with water  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=431) we know water is purified the best  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=433) solution  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=434) um  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=436) medium in the universe and that's ruled  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=438) as the necessary purification etcetera  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=440) that's all clear and obvious but if it's  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=442) missing then you keep the symbolic act  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=444) going by doing that i am so you don't  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=447) forget that there is an act to be done  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=449) the moment water is available either  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=451) really  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=452) or there was no water like in the desert  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=455) or as a  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=456) potentially because you have prevented  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=458) from using water because of a disease or  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=460) bandaging or something like that  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=463) so that's that that's the previously  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=465) then remember the favor all of you and  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=468) uh generally the previous things bishop  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=470) is favor of allah on you  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=472) because this injunction will will  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=474) improve you and leave you in the level  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=476) here up in the level of humanity because  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=478) the beast does not have a ritual  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=480) purification  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=481) and really it attempts to purify itself  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=485) but human beings are  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=487) having this can have that and this way  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=489) they improve their  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=491) their appearance they improve their body  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=493) smell etc by these injunctions and this  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=495) first step we will learn from that and  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=496) to improve further and develop further  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=499) and then remember also  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=502) remember the covenant you made  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=516) there is no deity except allah  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=519) and or there's the only deity in  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=521) existence three days of  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=522) being the deity meaning is the one who  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=524) created by sovereign will completely  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=527) intimidated by all internal uh  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=529) uh internal power  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=531) and is not created is necessarily  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=533) existing and based on that because the  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=535) severine acting by free will he is off  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=539) knowledgeable of all possible  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=540) contingencies and he is also  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=544) capable of choosing injunction and  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=546) commandments so is the supreme commander  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=548) also economic conduct those mechanisms  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=551) and this you say i'm ready to obey and  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=553) and accept i needed to submit that's the  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=555) meaning  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=557) worship me the equivalent meaning that's  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=560) the one side of the factual reality the  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=562) other side was the response from human  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=564) side human side is attributing all these  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=566) these features to allah especially the  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=568) supreme part of divinity which is really  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=571) lordship that is the ultimate severity  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=573) his command is absolute cannot be  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=575) questioned cannot be even very cannot be  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=577) even argued because if you argue with  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=579) you under my reason reason does it lose  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=581) its sense and it collapses as we  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=583) discussed in the book of taheed  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=585) indicates in in in the boring details  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=587) fine details  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=589) they be discussed in the chapters on the  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=591) translation still in even more excessive  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=593) details  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=595) so there's a covenant so remember  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=596) discover that you said we is here  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=598) underway because  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=599) it's not just this is just estimated  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=602) no there's a commitment  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=603) accept and surrender to allah  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=607) that's the reason when allah  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=609) addressed muslims in arabic  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=612) if you got in the writing of the old  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=613) testament there was a discussion what  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=616) how much should i tell have sent to me  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=618) say i usually on to your grandparents as  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=621) he should die there's a strong god but  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=624) now tell him the one who is he  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=626) yahuwah  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=628) and that translates in arabic  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=644) divinity to me and accept me as the  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=647) ultimate servant who's worthy of  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=649) obedient submission and be ready to  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=650) submit and accept it's not just  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=652) acknowledging theoretically but you have  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=654) to  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=655) do the act above me worship me submit to  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=658) me  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=658) as the ultimate story so somehow  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=662) so remember this covenant don't forget  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=664) this is the fundamental covenant  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=666) which makes them which gives the human  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=667) existence as a rational being  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=670) humans were before they developed to the  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=672) level when they were half monkeys are  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=674) they they were irrelevant they were  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=676) eliminated only when they were elected  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=679) and the spirit will own on them  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=681) and they became rational and they  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=682) learned to  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=684) to  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=685) to formulate language and name things  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=687) like we discussed with  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=689) then  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=690) they became relevant beings above the  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=692) beast and of the and that's the only way  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=695) it they become is that because they're  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=696) chosen to be able to acknowledge allah  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=698) as the sovereign and submit to him  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=701) so that's it remember this for the  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=702) better covenant otherwise you mean it  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=704) your existence has no meaning it's empty  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=706) it's void does not make any sense it's  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=707) just rubbish nothing like any animal no  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=710) difference between you any animal

[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=857) there's every fundamental eye and says  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=858) that you have to be standing upright for  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=860) allah and

[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=874) hatred should not persuade that you hate  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=876) someone for example then you witness  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=878) against him negatively because of hatred  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=882) foregoing equity if you are if you are  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=884) evaluating something  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=886) that's obviously most most pressing in a  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=888) court of law that's what most people  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=890) understand but there's a mistake that's  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=891) in every in every situation and every  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=894) evaluation  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=896) uh  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=899) the evaluation should be really  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=900) irrequitable and just  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=902) and and and reasonable  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=904) uh here not persuaded by someone being  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=906) an enemy that you that you are  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=909) attributing action which you did not do  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=911) or negativity which is not heavy and for  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=913) example you may have enmity let's say  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=915) with  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=915) with a certain person it does not mean  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=918) that you say because of dispute of  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=919) financial issues it does not it's not  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=921) proper that you say he's really a mean  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=923) person he is a wife peter who is not or  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=926) he is he's he's stingy maybe he is not  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=929) fisting yes maybe but not this one so  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=931) people tend to deviate and claim things  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=934) about their their enemies  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=936) excessively then what's the case no  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=938) that's not should be the case and if he  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=940) does something right and you are called  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=942) for witness you say yes he did this this  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=944) way and that's it there's no way you can  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=946) you can  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=948) you can do  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=949) if you are not because you have to stand  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=951) for allah in the proper witness and in a  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=953) just unequitable way not persuaded by  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=955) enmity of anybody to deviate from this  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=959) and uh and this is very important and  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=961) don't let the hatred or the or the  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=964) threat or another side like for example  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=967) uh like for example we mentioned sloth  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=969) al-baqarah when some muslims will guess  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=972) that it is not the beginning of the holy  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=973) month where the fighting is not  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=975) permitted they made agreement in  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=977) progress they they they attacked  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=981) i will forgot to record i have the other  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=982) recording one going anyway  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=985) let me make sure that i am doing the  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=986) recording also here  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=988) probably  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=992) so hello forgot this  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=996) uh so don't uh in and uh the quran came  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=999) clearly saying that transgressing in the  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1000) in the in the in the holy month is a big  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1003) sin  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1004) but what qualities committed as crime is  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1006) bigger but does not justify okay  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1008) breaking the the uh the holy month so  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1011) that was how how to do witness upright  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1014) everyone giving his own  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1016) blame and its own uh  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1018) uh  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1019) attribution of justice and injustice  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1021) so that's it and as usual quran  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1023) concludes all with some divine  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1025) attributes related to the issue allah  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1027) knows exactly what you are doing because  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1029) witnessing and not witnessing and making  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1031) expression is usually an act as usually  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1033) expects external so allah is aware about  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1035) also external work not only in the  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1037) previous  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1038) inside the heart and the intention and  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1039) the motivation and the information but  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1041) also the external acts are very well  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1043) aware about him  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1045) he's aware about them in addition to  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1048) what knowing really in the hearts  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1050) and the motivation and which motivation  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1052) is justified motivation is not justified  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1056) next  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1063) [Music]

[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1070) shall be forgiveness of sins and a  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1072) mighty reward next translation god has  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1075) promised forgiveness and rich rewards to  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1077) those who have faith and do good works  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1080) yeah i think we don't need to comment  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1082) and this has benefited the quran with  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1083) various functions but this is our last  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1085) promise  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1086) uh for those who have fulfilled this  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1089) condition they attain faith and they do  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1091) good deeds that's the only process for  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1092) those they will have forgiveness and  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1094) great reward  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1096) and allah will never fail his promise  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1098) so you fulfill your side of the bargain  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1100) you attain faith and do good deeds then  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1102) you can be certain that allah will  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1104) fulfill his covenant because it's  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1105) impossible for allah to break his  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1107) promise  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1108) in providing favor  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1110) threaten threats and and punishment  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1112) allah can't forg for forego them because  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1114) he's the sovereign there is no power  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1116) over him preventing him from that and  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1118) doesn't undermine his divine authority  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1120) and via rank but but promising something  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1123) to give you something or give you a  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1124) favor and withholding it is is undivine  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1127) and uh  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1129) mean and low and allah is above that for  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1131) certainty so this is so the word of  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1134) allah must  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1143) the next one it comes even with a form  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1145) which is clearly not even word or white  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1147) just just general statement  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1156) whereas they who are bent on denying the  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1158) truth and giving the lie to our messages  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1161) they are destined for the blazing fire  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1163) yeah next translation whereas those who  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1166) deny our revelation and our  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1168) our revelations and lie are destined for  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1170) the blazing fire yeah  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1172) many people uh uh uh especially hawaii  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1175) but not hawaii some people saw  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1179) they think this is this is a report this  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1182) is khabar and allah report will  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1184) will uh must be true it must happen but  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1187) this is not a report this is the threat  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1190) these who have this feature will be  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1192) destined to the hell fire  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1194) our heaven will be still created this  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1196) will be still certain so this is a this  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1198) is a announcing a divine action this is  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1201) under threat and threat can be forgotten  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1204) so if someone tell you that that this is  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1206) inevitably happening because it's a  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1207) habit it's not a habit it looks like a  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1208) howard it has the form of a habit of a  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1210) report  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1212) as a statement of fact but it's not it  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1214) is a threat what will happen in the  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1215) future which allah very well can forego  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1218) yeah  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1219) so that's that's a  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1220) deep point related to the matter of of  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1223) uh the difference between divine promise  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1225) of and giving favor and divine threat of  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1228) meeting punishment  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1229) how do you determine that is that  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1230) linguistically  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1232) you  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1237) because this is this is the punishment  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1239) here is uh for the cover on someone this  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1241) is allah's right  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1243) he is purely his right there are things  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1245) for example like for example if someone  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1248) rise you kill someone allah promise him  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1250) he will get a retribution of  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1252) this must be fulfilled because the  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1254) giving the one who has been killed and  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1255) justifying  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1256) his his  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1257) compensation is a promise on allah he  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1260) must fulfill it  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1261) no doubt but afterwards have been  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1263) compensated and so on and uh he received  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1266) from good deeds of the killer and  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1268) or unloaded his sins on the killer the  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1270) killer is not liable for the hellfire  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1272) the rest is allah is allah privilege he  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1275) can do what he can leave it  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1277) and so and everything else  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1280) is this distinction for something to be  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1282) a promise  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1286) that form of this ayah looks like a  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1287) haber but it's not a  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1289) so again how do you determine that is it  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1291) linguistically or through the comments  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1294) look at it look at the meaning of it  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1296) it means those who deny our eyes and so  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1299) on they will be cast in the hellfire  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1300) they will have the blazing fire i will  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1302) do that it is not is not dictated by  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1305) rationalization that's happening by  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1307) necessity even allah will or doesn't  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1309) work no it's about allah creating the  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1311) fire and putting them in the fire  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1314) so it looks like it in it at first it  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1316) looks like hubble it is not a hover  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1317) because it's related to the future  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1321) whatever yet the future is generally  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1324) uh uh is  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1326) somewhat it could be haber which is  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1327) neutral neither a punishment like for  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1329) example the prophet said  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1336) there is some publication there about  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1337) that because soon before soon there will  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1340) be a fire coming from that valley which  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1342) will be seen even in boston okay  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1346) that's a habit of this this is not a  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1348) punishment for anyone or reward for  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1349) anyone it's just something will happen  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1350) that's what will happen is physically in  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1352) the physical universe this is the khabar  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1354) and this khabar must be true and it has  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1356) become true we know that how many years  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1358) 640 or something injury  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1360) 1245 58 or 57  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1364) anna domini the volcano erupted that  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1367) that must happen  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1368) there's no way this  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1370) will tend to be false because at the  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1371) moment the prophet pronounced that allah  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1373) obliged on himself that it will be  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1375) happening he did not specify a time so  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1377) allah tell him to make it soon or later  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1379) he made it in a time which is just  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1381) perfect for many other reasons according  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1383) to his knowledge  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1385) there is no threat of any punishment to  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1387) anything no reward for anything it's  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1389) just the physical development of the  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1391) earth so it's inevitably going to happen  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1393) there's no escape  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1395) yeah  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1398) also is going to happen  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1400) not because of the khabar it's  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1401) definitely a habit but because that says  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1404) if that's the reason that those who  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1406) did good deed will be will be given the  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1408) reward  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1409) so it has to come day is not fixed but  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1412) it has to come so that who's that good  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1414) deed will get the reward  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1417) and those who did by these will get to  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1419) the punishment if allah decides to to  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1421) execute them with the  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1423) the punishment i'm just going into some  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1425) philosophical point because some people  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1427) think this is  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1428) obligatory  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1429) where it is not  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1430) threats are not obligated in allah to  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1431) fulfill  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1433) promises are obligatory obliged to  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1435) himself because this will be undivided  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1436) will be below the divine rank to promise  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1438) to give a favor and fail to do that  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1440) that it can be done only by a mean being  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1443) but for promising  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1445) or threatening a punishment and then  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1446) forgot which is purely  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1448) he can it doesn't reduce our allah's  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1450) rank nor make him to to be look bad or  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1453) look low just opposite look make him  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1455) look high  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1456) so there's no problem there i'm just  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1458) mentioning that casually just people  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1460) keep that in mind  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1463) okay  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1464) and all these future events and so on  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1466) are essentially most of them are  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1467) essentially are either promised or why  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1470) they are not really pure harbor except  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1471) few things like like for example uh the  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1476) the fire in hijaz like the warning the  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1478) um that the mongols will attack and so  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1480) on and they will be terrified and in the  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1482) morning the crossing the river will be  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1484) one dnr and the evening because of fear  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1486) and people running away like like  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1488) headless chicken it will be 100 dinner  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1490) that's happened when the bengal came  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1492) into iraq that happened it invited out  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1494) because they bought  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1497) good  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1500) yeah is it clear or is there anything  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1502) yeah sure i understand so there is  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1504) distinction that is defined by context  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1507) and this clearly that is this is a  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1509) threat of if it is if something which  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1511) can be only done and meet meeted by  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1513) allah like punishment hellfire and so he  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1515) says only to allah nobody has or  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1517) anything like that  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1520) yeah  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1522) so that's it  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1526) but this is a deep point it's very  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1527) important that the promise promise  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1529) giving favor giving reward is absolutely  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1532) binding on allah almighty promises is no  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1534) way he is going to fail on it ever  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1536) because it will contradict his being the  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1538) divine the the having the divine  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1540) attributes it will undermine divinity  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1542) the same like allah will never lie  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1545) because lying will be contradictory to  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1547) the divine uh  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1549) purity and majesty and he has prohibited  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1551) all the lines contingent you will you  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1553) can lie if you can die for sure a divine  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1556) being could lie if he wanted but he  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1558) deprived himself of that he excluded  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1560) lying for all eternity the same with  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1562) deceiving but punishing the the scepters  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1565) by deceiving them is perfectly  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1567) permissible and that's what he did also  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1569) but he said all all the time the quran  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1572) those who would try to deceive allah  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1574) allah will deceive them will lock them  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1576) in in their own deception but will never  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1578) start with deception  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1580) but if someone is trying to deceive  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1581) allah like someone african assault he  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1583) will deceive them  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1584) get them through to think that they are  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1586) doing fine and surviving and so those  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1588) are fighting allah's messenger they  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1590) think first they are successful they are  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1591) achieving a reality they are being  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1593) locked  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1595) they being drawn into their own into  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1597) their own demise that's that's  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1599) that's a counter deception which  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1600) perfectly accepts all this as a  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1602) punishment for them  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1604) but not initial deception nor lying  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1612) so the things which allah has prohibited  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1613) himself to do  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1615) from the beginning of the of of or  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1618) in eternity from attending to entirety  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1619) that's lying initially the injustice  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1622) what in the prophet definition was  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1623) injustice injustice that i punish you  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1626) for something which you don't do that's  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1628) definitely injustice if you do if you  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1629) don't do something then i cannot account  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1631) for you and this definitely allah is  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1633) above that that's impossible etcetera  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1635) the various type of justice there's a  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1637) reason and you say i have prohibited  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1639) injustice on me and they made it  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1641) between you  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1642) because very well possible for for  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1645) all powerful being to be unjust but that  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1648) is merely possible because of power does  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1650) not mean it will be ever happening  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1651) because of divine majesty and divine  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1655) holiness  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1659) like for example some ash ali claimed  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1661) that let me give one this point that  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1663) it's possible for allah to to make an  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1665) injunction which you cannot follow you  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1667) cannot comply with attack  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1670) yes it is within the power but allah has  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1673) prohibited himself from that too for all  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1674) eternity like only  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1676) allah will not give you an injection say  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1678) do they like for example say without  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1680) wings and any machinery fly in the air  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1682) and otherwise they will punish you that  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1684) will be injust  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1685) this will never happen from eternity to  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1687) eternity allah has prohibited themselves  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1688) from doing such nonsensical things that  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1691) is within the power yeah i support even  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1692) the humans  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1693) it's not another problem for sure it's  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1695) an even more powerful being but does not  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1698) need that within the power that it is it  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1700) will ever happen but the cleveland world  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1702) attack is impossible for allah  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1705) because he prohibited himself from doing  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1707) that  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1708) he derived himself from this is excluded  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1710) the moment is decided in eternity it  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1712) will be so until all eternities  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1715) okay and this is issues of related qatar  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1717) and so on which we will discuss sometime  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1719) and we discuss in another context in  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1720) java  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1722) so that's the the this is that obviously  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1726) what the problem is for the believer and  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1727) the threat for the disbelievers  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1736) foreign  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1743) remember the blessings which god  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1744) bestowed upon you  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1746) when hostile people were about to lay  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1748) hands on you and he stayed their hands  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1750) from you  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1751) remain then conscious of god and in god  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1754) let the believers place their trust  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1756) next translation  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1757) believers remember how god favored you  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1759) when certain people were about to attack  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1761) you and he protected you from them be  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1764) always mindful of god let the believers  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1766) put their trust in him  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1773) uh sheikh you've gone muted  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1789) this is almost certainly here this this  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1791) system has to be changed it's having  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1793) problems um it's almost certainly uh  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1797) referring to the preparation of hassan  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1799) the sarasan is a is an arab tribe  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1802) who  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1803) settled in in the north of arabia and  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1805) syria essentially  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1807) it's settled ancient back possibly maybe  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1809) if the time hassan is not is not related  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1812) to the immigration of the arabs after  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1813) the collapse of the dam of sabah which  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1815) is recent around the time of christ no  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1817) this is people who migrated maybe even  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1820) with that before the time of abraham  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1823) maybe something like 2000 a year plus  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1825) before christ  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1827) some arab tribes settle in the north one  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1828) of them is rasa  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1831) and then we have uh we have uh you them  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1833) and  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1834) other tribes who settled very early  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1836) there anyway they settled there they  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1838) were really established over millennia  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1840) obviously at the time of islam they were  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1842) there for two plus thousand years  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1845) and they have killed them and so on the  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1847) vassal kingdoms of the roman era of the  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1850) roman byzantine umber empire  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1853) that is from an empire by the way the  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1855) byzantine empire is not never called  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1856) byzantine by themselves they call  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1858) themselves roman is from an empire later  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1860) on the name was given even after their  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1862) fall they were called back by the thing  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1864) before that they were not called by  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1865) something  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1866) only later historian called them  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1868) byzantine anyway they were vassals and  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1871) when uh when the baratham sent his  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1873) letter to hercules and to orchestra and  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1876) the king of berger etc and various kings  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1879) uh hercules played again a sneaky game  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1882) he showed some respect to the letter and  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1884) put it in a box and so on not like the  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1886) stupid the king of persia who told the  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1889) letter and so on inviting other cares  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1891) and their public subjugation  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1893) against him this data has mentioned we  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1895) now that would reset the two would have  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1897) been sent in the early sixth year of  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1898) israel  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1900) and uh  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1902) but the letter clearly asked him to  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1904) enter islam or give him the following  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1906) option which is outrageous for his  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1908) historic purposes if you don't accept no  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1911) problem but don't prevent me from  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1912) talking to the common people don't  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1914) prevent dawah that's all that's required

[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1929) the message  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1932) clearly he did not  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1933) do not do that  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1935) either of his own free will or on the  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1937) pressure of his of his bishops and his  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1940) his uh  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1941) royal guard and royal people uh and you  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1945) know any even even the biggest tyrant he  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1947) has to appease his his entourage peace

[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1953) who has real power at the time of  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1955) obviously the princes that become  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1957) military commanders and  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1959) and uh  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1960) the bishops which are the cheshire was  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1962) at the time completely well settled and  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1964) dominant  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1966) so  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1968) he  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1969) he interfered with the people going to  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1971) that one century of allah sends people  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1973) to go down to the various  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1974) sub-communities there in syria to hassan  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1976) to others and with messages even some of  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1979) the diplomatic community having letters  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1981) to the king of assad  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1982) and one of these messengers got killed  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1986) and they were preparing for for battle  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=1990) there's a hadith

[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2000) and one day i go to the market because i  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2001) have to end living for my for my  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2003) children and they arranged with someone  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2005) one of my answers brother he did not  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2007) mention the name of his society brother  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2009) uh arranged with him that the day i am  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2011) in the market he would be the head of  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2012) the messenger of allah in the evening he  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2013) gave me all the information and what he  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2015) has learned and the other day i do the  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2017) same to him  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2019) so in the day  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2020) where uh  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2021) i was in the market and came home  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2024) late in the afternoon and sorry came  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2026) late because the helicopter continued  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2027) until madrid  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2029) he came dead and then he screamed from  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2031) outside the house say  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2033) huge news  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2035) so omar said  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2036) i thought son is coming now the army was  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2039) trying because because we hear that  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2040) rasan is putting iron hooves on their  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2042) horses in preparation of attacking us so  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2045) i said did rasam come  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2048) that's the only thing which could  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2050) envision a  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2052) shocking news a shocking news say no  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2054) even more shocking that he said you know  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2056) allah divorced all his wives including  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2058) your daughter because this daughter  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2059) household  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2060) so i almost said i was almost blind so i  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2063) was touching trying to find my my  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2065) sandals with my sandals and went down to  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2067) the messenger of allah to see what has  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2069) happened so you see how how the attitude  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2071) of the companions about how they love  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2073) and care for the process anything in the  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2075) household of the prophet is even more  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2077) disturbing for them than the army of  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2079) rasan coming  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2080) so he went there and he clarified the  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2082) matter anyway  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2083) so this hadith show you that they were  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2085) expecting an attack of hassan and from  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2087) that you can glean the the time of that  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2089) it's not to be like later in the sixth  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2091) year of vigilance you see many people  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2093) many references claim that the letters  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2095) of prophet wanted in the beginning of  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2096) the seventh year after coming back from  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2098) her diabetes that's not correct there's  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2100) another narrative by venus hack that was  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2102) in the sixth year and this is a correct  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2104) one how do we know that just a small  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2106) information aside because kisara the one  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2108) who received that message  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2110) and told the letter later on was killed  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2112) with your son and when he sent a  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2120) bring him to for punishment that's what  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2122) him  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2123) told us what him my lord killed your  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2125) lord he has killed tonight by his own  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2127) son they said this they recorded time  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2129) and went back to yemen he was sent from  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2131) his vassal kingdom in yemen they went  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2133) back to yemen when the allah said that's  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2135) what muhammad said and the role of said  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2138) didn't receive any news if that's true  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2140) then the man is definitely a prophet and  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2142) few days later the news came that the  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2144) son of christ  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2146) the killing of kasra is known in the in  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2148) the roman records we know it i think  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2149) it's 28th february 623  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2153) i have it in my waiver anyway and the  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2155) ruling of his son which followed would  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2158) rule for seven months and was done died  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2160) in  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2161) in the plague and the death of the  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2162) plague is known and his death is known  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2164) because his mother is a christian and  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2166) she's actually the daughter of  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2169) of uh king maurice more  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2174) emperor who has a long story by himself  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2177) so we know from these dates and from  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2178) there from the uh from the uh  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2180) architecture and from archaeology and  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2183) from from coins etc imprinted coins  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2186) that's definitely must be the letter  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2187) must have got in the 16. so that that  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2189) event in the late sixth year early seven  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2191) years the event that hassan was  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2193) preparing and the divorce issue was  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2195) preparing for the button  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2196) but somehow they didn't attack i don't  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2199) know exactly what historically happened  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2201) maybe i should check tabari possibly  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2203) maybe the king that king died or there  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2205) was a rebellion inside the palace or  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2206) something like that or what they or  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2208) maybe hercules stepped and told them  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2209) don't do this nonsense whatever it is  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2211) they did not fulfill there and so allah  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2214) allah allah they stretched their hand  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2216) they're about to come they were really  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2218) moving the the  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2220) the horses with the new iron hooves etc  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2223) but allah prevented took their hand away  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2225) stopped their hand from any action from  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2228) his own with no action from the side of  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2230) the believer  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2232) but the mischief continued that further  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2234) further emission is unfair that the ayah  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2236) were killed by them which led to the  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2238) battle campaign of muta and which said  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2244) so this is this but this is the incident  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2246) specifically is this one most likely  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2248) it's the attack the preparation that  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2250) attack and  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2251) it was very matured they were moving  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2254) and they were making uh developing a  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2257) campaign of uh several tens maybe a  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2258) hundred thousand people to attack medina  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2260) but allah  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2262) created such condition that they were  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2265) they were prevented from any any moving  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2268) another adaptation what is animal one is  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2270) that possibly that the uh that the uh  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2274) the attempt of kisrah to detain the  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2276) roshan by sending this this swat team to  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2278) madina and then allah stepped in by by  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2281) moving his son against him and getting  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2283) him killed  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2284) and the the power situation pleasure  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2286) completely changed either way it is this  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2288) or this it is definitely a date six  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2291) eighty seven year  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2293) so  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2295) we acknowledge  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2296) uh the favor allah knew that that such  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2301) a possible  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2302) danger  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2304) an imminent danger has been available by  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2307) an action from his side without any  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2309) doing purify otherwise he would have  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2311) been facing an enormous tough battle  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2313) definitely  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2314) but allah be conscious  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2317) and on allah the believer should be  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2321) relying upon and trusting only and allah  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2323) should trust and rely  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2329) a new section or a new set of issues  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2331) they start  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2332) uh reminding of the history of bani  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2334) israel and what has happened in the time  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2336) past  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2364) and indeed god accepted a similar solemn  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2366) pledge from the children of israel when  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2369) he when we caused 12 of their leaders to  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2372) be sent to the canaan i spies that's in  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2375) brackets and god said behold i shall be  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2378) with you if you are constant in prayer  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2380) and spend in charity and believe in my  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2382) apostles and aid them and offer up unto  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2385) god a goodly loan  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2387) i will surely efface your bad deeds and  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2389) bring you into the garden through which  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2391) running waters flow  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2393) but he from among you who after this  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2395) deny the truth will indeed have stayed  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2398) straight from the right path next  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2400) translation  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2402) god took a pledge from the children of  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2404) israel we appointed 12 of them as  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2406) leaders and god said i am with you if  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2409) you are regular in prayer  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2411) give the purifying arms and believe in  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2414) my messengers and support them and lend  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2417) god a good loan i will cleanse you of  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2419) your bad deeds and admit you into  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2421) gardens with flowing rivers  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2424) after this any of you who deny the truth  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2427) will be far from the right path  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2429) okay so that's very clear so i don't  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2431) think the issue mentioning  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2433) that in parenthesis  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2437) canaan actually uh the shows of the  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2440) twelve leader from the twelve tribes as  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2442) previously before with that even i think  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2444) that was done even when they're still in  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2446) egypt because they're divided in twelve  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2448) nations or immediately after the  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2450) externals whatever it is  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2453) so allah established them even after 12  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2455) entities so like like a federation of 12  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2457) states and every one of them as in other  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2460) solar stress  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2461) musa is even acknowledged the favor  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2464) allah view  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2465) appointed messengers and prophets under  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2467) you and made every one of you a king  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2470) everyone is out no more sleep you are  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2472) you are a master of your own destiny you  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2473) have you have authority that's it you  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2476) are  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2476) if you use  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2477) language you are a complete democracy  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2479) you are your own masters  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2482) and obviously the divine commandments  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2483) you have what authority of yourself  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2486) and even even although they are from one  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2489) grandfather still allah allows them to  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2491) be in 12 and 12 nations and 12  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2493) authorities and manage themselves  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2496) and what was the promise  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2499) and what's the covenant  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2501) not questioning the land of canaan this  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2503) is the small gift this is not that the  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2504) relevance will come and so that  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2506) the most important is that if you  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2507) establish regular prayer and pay you  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2510) zakat  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2511) and believe in my messengers and support  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2513) them  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2514) and do good deeds  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2515) give allah a good day loan go do a good  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2518) extra charity extra good works  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2520) i will forgive your sins because  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2522) everyone will be sinning will be they  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2523) will be always shortcoming and they will  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2525) enter you in paradise and gardens and  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2527) the hotel flow  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2529) so anyone committing cover reject the  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2532) truth after this covenant he has been  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2535) gone long  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2537) uh astray in this promise there is no  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2539) giving a land forever that's another  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2542) sub subsection  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2544) secondly the no promise of of victory in  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2548) in battlefields or kingdom under  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2551) control on earth that's the reality in  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2553) the time of kings there was qatar tribes  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2555) and they have prophets or judging  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2557) between them and they living completely  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2558) decentralized  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2560) this is the way of life allah wanted for  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2562) them allah did not want them to have a  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2563) kingdom they asked for kingdom we  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2564) discussed that when we discussed it in  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2566) surah al-baqarah they ask our king  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2567) claiming a kingdom a central authority  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2570) which is more conducive that we can  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2572) fight better which is allah is not true  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2574) because they were not fighting even  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2576) under the central authority they they  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2578) were not fighting better than before  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2579) they chickened out from fighting when it  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2581) was obligated obligated because they're  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2583) not obliged to fight there was no  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2585) obligation of fighting or made on them  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2587) they can whatever force comes  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2590) when pharaoh attacks us and kings of  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2591) canaan  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2592) he passes through israel they don't get  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2595) involved go past we have nothing to do  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2596) we are peaceful we will we are just  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2598) doing our prayer and doing our worship  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2601) we have we we are not vying for full  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2603) control of authority or kingdom so they  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2605) have never any conflict with the pharaoh  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2607) in india times until they started vying  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2609) for kingdom and control then they got  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2611) into conflict with everyone in the world  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2613) which is natural because  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2616) that's the result if you want is you  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2617) have to to be dominant and have control  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2619) then some other people will try to  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2621) dispute with you and then you will have  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2623) you may get in trouble and that's  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2624) exactly what they got in but individual  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2626) of that  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2627) that's the promise you do that i will do  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2629) that all other things are secondary uh  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2632) really but  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2639) so that's the covenant the covenant is  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2641) that they establish prayer they they  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2644) give the obligatory zakat they believe  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2646) in the messages and support them  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2649) if they don't do that then they have  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2650) broken the covenant that they don't have  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2652) their promise for  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2653) not even the promising dunya which as i  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2655) said is a footnote  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2658) is of no great relevance  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2686) we rejected them and caused their hearts  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2689) too hard  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2690) so that now they distort the meaning the  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2692) revealed words  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2693) taking them out of their context and  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2695) they have forgotten much of what they  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2697) had been told to bear in mind and from  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2700) all but a few of them thou wilt always  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2703) experience treachery but pardon them and  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2706) forbear  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2707) verily god loves the doers of good  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2710) next translation but because they broke  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2711) their pledge we rejected them and  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2714) hardened their hearts they distorted the  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2716) meaning of the revealed words and they  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2718) have forgotten a lot of what they have  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2720) been told to remember  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2722) you will always find a seat in all but a  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2724) few of them  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2725) forgive them and forget  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2727) god love those who honor him by  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2729) forgiving  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2731) as a show of small translation that he  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2734) translated the word nasu and the  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2735) forgotten actually  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2737) mean forgotten but nasi mean also for  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2740) forsaken or left left left left  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2742) deliberately  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2744) so that's not necessary that they forgot  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2746) it it's where they slip out of the  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2748) memory they have forsaken it as if it's  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2750) have been forgotten so here is most  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2752) likely they forsaken a part of that or  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2754) they have given as injunction they just  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2757) put it at the side and decided not to  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2759) look at it as if it has been forgotten  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2761) or it is in the scripture there  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2763) definitely and there's no way they could  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2765) have forgotten it in the sense of a  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2766) whole nation forgetting it but as a  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2768) matter of fact it was  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2770) it was forsaken by them so forsaken or  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2773) left or deserted is the better  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2775) translation  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2778) so that's one so because of their  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2781) breaking of the covenant allah  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2783) they rejected them all  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2786) it scares them they are cursed they are  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2788) expelled out of the mercy they are  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2789) rejected from the divine audience and  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2791) their heart became heart  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2793) the quran used the word  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2795) we made their heart heart meaning  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2797) as a result in the system of universe if  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2799) you break your covenant and allah cares  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2802) you then by necessary your heart will  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2804) develop into hardness because if  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2806) if it would have been soft and staying  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2808) soft you would have not broke the coming  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2810) out of it so they become that's that's  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2812) the result of that not that allah made  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2814) that house which was soft revolt no they  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2816) had developed into hardness by this  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2817) misbehavior that misbehavior make you  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2820) develop that  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2821) but this could not happen having the  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2823) universe except by the way allah  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2824) featured created the hearts and the  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2826) minds and so on they the moment you  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2829) accept falsehood  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2831) under the  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2832) play with the revelation then you will  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2834) be blinded and you will go that's the  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2836) way that that's by by necessity of the  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2838) way the mind and the heart works  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2840) and one one feature of that one  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2842) cliffhanger that they they twist words  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2844) of the revelation and the injection of  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2846) the prophets from their own taking their  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2848) out of context and playing with them  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2850) around like for example they claim until  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2852) now that they have this land is promised  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2853) for them  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2854) it was given to them not all of it by  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2856) the way  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2857) if you go to the old testament like for  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2859) example i think it's the book of numbers  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2861) we have genesis leave that that's not  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2863) racial then we have extrados and then  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2865) everything numbers so when the numbers  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2866) one is science and i think in numbers  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2869) and numbers the the allocation of this  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2871) tribe have this area from this and this  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2873) giving borders but don't go to that area  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2875) it is for your cousin from edom edom is  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2878) not from israel is supposed to be from  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2880) ace from uh  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2882) and this is for karana don't go there so  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2884) very well with that it's all forgotten  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2887) they have shut it out  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2889) that's what was given to them just go  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2891) and read it by yourself not even full  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2893) palestine is given to them  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2895) not even for palestine that's for the  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2897) quran this is for the edomite don't take  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2899) this don't go there don't go there  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2901) and they show the truth and they gave us  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2903) and then now they claim they're giving  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2905) the land from egypt until until  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2907) euphrates and things like that according  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2908) to their faulty imagination taking  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2910) things out of it that's the only place  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2912) they have given any land is that i think  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2914) in numbers or maybe in in  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2916) leviticus maybe or the throne i think  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2918) it's in numbers and one of the five  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2920) books anyway  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2922) clearly specified the borders and so on  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2924) according to the best knowledge of their  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2926) time  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2926) so that's even that even that  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2929) that point is even taken out of context  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2931) and many other things like the sabbath  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2933) respecting the sabbath clear limitation  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2935) of the sabbath not only the sabbath of  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2937) the week there's a lot of years maybe  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2938) you're not aware about that every seven  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2940) years  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2941) the seventh year should be a sabbath the  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2943) land should be left alone to recover and  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2945) heal itself yeah yes indeed and every  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2948) seven they call it a  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2950) week of years and every seven weeks of  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2952) years that's 49 years the last sabbath  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2955) of the seventh week  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2957) that's the year number 49 should be a  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2959) year of freeing the slave  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2961) and foregoing all debts  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2963) and there is an injunction nobody should  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2966) stop giving debts and cancelling debts  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2968) before that to run away from this earth  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2970) but they were obviously they're taking  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2971) liberty that the sabbath was forgotten  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2974) tens of seventy of sabbaths and the the  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2978) 49ers called the jubilee years have been  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2980) forgotten hundreds of years and that's  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2982) one of the reasons that they the  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2983) bibliographic style was 70 and prophet  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2985) jeremiah said i think or daniel there  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2988) will be 70 years there to compensate for  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2990) the  
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2991) as many sabbaths they have missed all  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2993) over these years so they were missing  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2994) all the sabbaths they were breaking it  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2996) continuously  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2997) sabbaths from years some also weeks and  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=2999) sabbaths of all of the sabbath of  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3001) sabbaths which is jubilee  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3003) and so on and so on and they find all  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3006) kind of excuses or kind of twisting the  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3008) words out of their place that's all  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3010) because the heart has become hot they  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3012) could have break of the covenant because  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3014) they're they're just and then in  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3015) addition they have decided to forsake  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3017) some of that what they have been  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3019) instructed and  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3020) told to uh to study  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3023) there's even an evidence internally that  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3026) that one of the king found the book  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3027) which was buried in in  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3029) the arc of covenant or somewhere in the  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3031) temple and it was not known and used for  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3034) several centuries complete book some  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3037) people speculate that maybe they tell  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3038) enemy  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3039) complete book was not used and unknown  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3041) for centuries  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3043) and was hidden somewhere imagine that  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3045) yeah  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3048) and then addressed to rajab you will  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3049) always see that some of them will be  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3051) committing traditionally and breaking  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3053) their covenants and except few of them  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3056) so what was the response far for unh  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3058) fire forgive and turn away  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3060) allah loves those who do well  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3063) there's nothing can be done about these  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3064) people  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3065) as long as they don't wage war nothing  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3066) capitalistic just stand away from them  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3068) what can you do  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3071) on this note  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3073) there's a question in this game some  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3074) muslims justify  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3075) seeking to justify the modern israeli  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3077) state by invoking the covenant god made  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3079) with him  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3084) this is all these are government  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3086) scholars or government agents that's it  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3088) nothing there  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3089) their own scriptures or do they  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3090) reference islamic scriptures as well  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3094) about what the reference if they reflect  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3095) their scripture that's irrelevant  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3097) because this tradition is clearly  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3098) against them if they if they refer  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3101) islamic scripture the scriptures here  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3102) you'll be just reading the ayah they'll  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3104) read this ayah  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3106) yes they broke the covenant so there's  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3107) no covenant anymore  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3110) but they were in medina they were living  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3112) in medina they have their own  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3114) entities and so on they were committing  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3115) various strategies and so on but until  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3118) they waged war they were fought without  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3120) wage war just forgive them and turn away  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3122) from what can you do  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3126) so both counts they violated him yeah  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3128) yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3129) absolutely so the whole thing is is a  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3131) mockery they play with the  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3133) because most jews  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3136) and most christian by the way they're  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3137) completely unaware about what they what  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3138) is the description they're completely  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3142) they they they they uh uh  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3146) common muslims also similar but much  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3148) better at least appear muslim here's  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3150) some ayah here for example explaining  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3153) some ayah so they know much more about  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3154) the scripture and the deen than the than  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3157) the the  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3159) the common christian and jews just look  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3161) at the one of these competition programs  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3163) with like who wins a million  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3165) who wants to be a millionaire so some  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3167) question some of you pull your hair  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3169) thinking this is so trivial and so  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3170) obvious and they are unable to know  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3173) like some names of prophets and who was  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3175) in the will nobody knows  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3178) absolutely nobody trivia thinks which  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3180) even children in the muslim world know  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3182) they don't know  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3183) completely unaware so they take their  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3185) own people for a ride by such arguments  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3187) and by those twisting facts and so on  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3191) as i said that's given to israel by by  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3193) god's covenant so and that's all what  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3195) they say that's it  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3196) another covenant has been broken what  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3198) are related by baby exile how the  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3200) punishment was done all of that is just  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3202) forgotten is not mentioned  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3204) the irony is when atheist jews use them  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3207) yeah  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3208) because they they take the symbol that  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3210) doesn't exist according to you  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3212) they take the simple mind the jews for  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3214) the right they regard something like a  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3216) social and history that's it just  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3218) symbolism that's it it's just  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3221) it's like if i don't believe in  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3222) something then nothing actually happened  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3224) yeah a non-entity something i don't  
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3226) believe in exist promise something  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3227) that's like saying the tooth fairy told  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3229) me  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3232) but these atheists are  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3234) a master of deception and they know they  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3236) cannot move the general masters except  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3237) by this way  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3240) that's the problem  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3241) they themselves  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3243) they actually say we're atheists  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3245) that's the irony is they actually  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3247) consider being atheists absolutely  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3250) absolutely and if you discuss them say  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3251) because the people believe allah gave  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3253) them the promise we are telling them  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3254) that what they believe accordingly you  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3256) know just just playing with them uh but  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3258) this is this is this is really  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3260) fundamental problem i remember in in  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3262) this blogging theology they had an  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3264) interview with a dale something  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3266) professor there something who was the  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3268) professor of  
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3269) modern bible or new testament studies  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3272) and the same time he's a priest  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3275) and the man admitted discussing  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3276) especially luca that there's no evidence  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3278) for trinity there and there's absolutely  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3281) nothing indicating that there is a claim  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3283) to be divine or there's nothing educated  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3284) that is really divine  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3286) then here the blogging theology you know  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3288) he's a soft man he's gentle he doesn't  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3289) want to worry friends he said but how to  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3292) deal with the situation now let's say  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3294) and what do you think their answer say  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3296) uh say but you are teaching that  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3298) possibly in the pulpit these things  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3300) say you know in post-modernism it it's a  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3303) matter of belief if you believe in  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3305) something that's what is valid for you  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3307) so the man is leaving all scholarship  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3309) all the rationality which he's teaching  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3311) as an academic professor  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3313) when he's talking the people is that  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3315) what we believe is matters even if it  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3317) doesn't relate to any historic reality  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3320) so somehow belief becomes defining  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3322) defining truth  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3324) not the opposite the truth should be the  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3325) best in which you believe and you have  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3327) to refine the things before you believe  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3329) in them  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3330) because that's it and he argues that  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3331) because now in post-modern time that's  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3333) the way to go with great because he  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3335) believes  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3336) that's a professor of new testament  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3338) study  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3339) who is a priest at the same time so he  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3341) doesn't feel that there's a fundamental  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3342) direction that's what he teaches there  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3344) there's no grounding for that in the  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3346) university and but in the in in the  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3348) church he says otherwise because that's  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3350) the belief of the people and this is  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3351) this may this may shape their life in a  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3353) certain good way that's it  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3357) that's called theism  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3359) what counts is belief  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3361) relevant of it is absolutely fitting any  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3363) true reality or not which is a  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3365) catastrophic definition of truth and and  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3367) belief but this is what more  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3369) postmodernism have got us to because  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3372) when possible there is no absolute truth  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3374) everything is relative it depends upon  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3375) the social agreement and the social  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3377) situation that's an interesting one is  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3379) this is this also how you know like  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3381) trump whenever he would be dismissive of  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3383) objective facts by saying fake news and  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3386) people would kind of just follow it  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3387) that's your version of truth and what  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3389) have you exactly with people identifying  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3391) which is some things well that's the  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3393) only way they could even the middle ages  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3395) and earlier run away from the islamic  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3397) attack  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3398) was also  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3399) regular evidence  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3401) what is the truth check the quran if  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3403) this contradiction bring me the  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3404) contradiction and explain to you that  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3406) you are mistaken  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3407) or maybe you are telling the truth and  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3408) it's not from allah all of that's in the  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3410) table that's not the way it works there  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3412) that's not the way it works  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3416) that's not the way it works  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3418) for them unfortunately that's it  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3423) then after the jews he comes to the  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3424) christian  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3427) and then he says  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3442) and likewise from those who say behold  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3445) we are christians  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3447) we have accepted a solemn pledge and  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3449) they too have forgotten much of what  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3450) they have been told to bear in mind  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3452) wherefore we have given rise among them  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3455) to enmity and hatred to last until  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3458) resurrection day and in time god will  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3460) cause them to understand what they have  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3462) contrived  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3463) next translation and we also took the  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3465) pledge from those who say we are  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3467) christians but they have forgotten part  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3469) of what they were told to keep in mind  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3471) that caused resentment and the hatred  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3473) among them which we have permitted until  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3475) the resurrection day when god will  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3477) explain to them what they have done yeah  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3480) so i said that from those who said we  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3482) are not  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3484) that's what they were calling themselves  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3486) actually especially in in syriac and  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3489) arabic tradition they were not calling  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3491) that the calling themselves christian  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3493) started really in the greek in the greek  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3494) speak speaking area from antioch  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3497) northward south bound and arabia they  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3499) were not calling themselves christian  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3501) they're calling him  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3502) and the quran mentioned their name now  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3504) they call them christians okay call  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3505) themselves whatever you call we give you  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3507) the name you should join yourself but  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3508) for those who say we are not sorrow and  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3510) that's the name  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3511) we took the covenant and they forgot a  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3514) share not a bunch of but shall have  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3516) helped with a good chair or they not  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3518) forgot other forsaken also somebody's  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3520) forgotten lost assam is forsaken  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3528) now this is the result of that forsaking  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3530) some of us you get as scripture either  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3532) by by losing it completely  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3535) or by ignoring it or by forsaking it  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3541) the result is that you will have because  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3544) each one can can forsake something which  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3546) he doesn't like because people differ in  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3548) their taste and their orientation and  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3550) their background especially if you come  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3552) to a faith newly when the faith started  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3554) to spread people with pig and background  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3556) will would accept things which those  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3558) would one of these backgrounds will not  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3560) accept etcetera those from persian  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3562) background have another taste etc so  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3564) everyone forsakes something  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3567) then they split insects and crops by  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3569) necessity because if you take something  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3571) with scripture you don't have the  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3573) unifying image and picture  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3575) and that's exactly what happened to  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3576) muslim but i will understand in a second  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3578) so what's the result of before taking  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3580) something of the scripture  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3584) then we instigated between them hatred  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3586) and enmity until the day of resurrection  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3588) so if anyone tell you that the christian  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3590) will ever become unified tell him you  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3592) will never get through again until you  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3594) came there's no way  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3596) unless they cease to be christian and go  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3598) back to islam for example to the full  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3600) scripture but full scripture is gone  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3602) some of it is lost and cannot be a  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3604) certain like for example example in look  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3606) itself  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3607) there are clear  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3610) statements  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3611) and look is the one who is seem to be  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3612) historically most valid fits with most  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3614) historic description all it has  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3616) obviously non-historic things and so on  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3618) but the one who's historically most  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3619) reliable  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3620) is clearly  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3622) saying that that that he is a prophet  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3625) great prophet of god even after the  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3626) so-called crusades crucifixion say you  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3627) crucified the great man the great  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3629) prophet of god nothing in divinity at  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3631) all  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3632) that has been completely forsaken  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3635) so all those who claim his divine  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3637) somehow and so on are going straight  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3639) against this which is  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3641) so evident and also look iconic also if  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3644) you see blogging theology also with this  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3646) professor dale or someone else  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3647) he said lucas clearly denies any  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3650) possibility that jesus died for our sins  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3653) the so-called atonement and so on is  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3655) nonsense according to luke  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3657) so at least that's completely forsaken  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3660) it should be taken on board together  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3661) with the other evidences but it was  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3663) forsaken  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3664) so you will have people who are  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3665) declaring jesus to be divine saying that  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3667) half divine some some say his mother is  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3670) divine because a divine being was in her  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3671) belly so they were container for divine  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3673) so she  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3674) got a divinity by this by by induction  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3677) like electromagnetic abduction  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3679) others say no no  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3681) like the like the nestorian they say no  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3683) he was divine or appointed as a divine  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3686) son  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3687) on the baptism so he was born human  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3688) being pure human and his mother is just  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3690) a mother of pure human of the human  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3692) shell so the title mother of god is  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3694) completely pagan is not acceptable  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3697) and that's the reason they were  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3698) condemned and they ran away to persia to  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3700) find protection rather than be  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3702) eliminated under the raw easter roman  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3704) byzantine empire  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3706) so that's very clear  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3714) what they were doing through history  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3716) generation by generation what they did  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3718) with the mistake they then said what is  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3719) done deliberately was done by mistake  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3721) etcetera how much accountability that  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3723) would be the name  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3725) but look at this at the the the  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3727) interesting point  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3728) the moment you forsake some of the  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3730) scripture  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3731) then enmity and hatred will be  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3733) instigated between that community that's  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3735) exactly what happened the muslim spirit  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3736) in in in  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3738) in  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3742) they forsaken uh to take in the quran  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3744) and the sun and his totality starting  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3746) with with the jumping of your own power  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3753) some allied with  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3755) went extreme with ali uh  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3758) claiming things which are not true and  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3759) not fitting to him and even fabricating  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3761) and some align with marawi and then you  
[1:02:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3763) have the split and then there were sub  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3764) splits and then other people are  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3766) objecting to both and they create them  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3768) to be covered  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3769) and then each party has to to come with  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3772) terms with what have happened is to  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3773) happen historically is it by by  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3775) permission of allah or by will does  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3777) allah like it when it's like it and then  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3779) we have the jabari  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3780) and so on  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3785) each one forsake some of the scripture  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3788) each one for sake some scripture  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3791) they don't take it in full  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3795) the moment you first examined the  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3796) scripture  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3797) you have immediately in the nation of  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3799) the scripture of spirits factions and  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3802) they will be hostile to each other  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3805) and the only way is to take go back to  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3807) complete scripture and engage with islam  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3809) is very well possible because islam is  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3812) quran is definitely in our hand we know  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3814) that with certitude and sunnah in its  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3816) essential parts the tawatar and the  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3818) correct hadith at least the core of it  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3821) and the the  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3823) the the things which are not that well  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3825) established are usually secondary  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3826) regarding how to wash the feet and  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3828) things like that so nonsense of the all  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3829) the fundamental things  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3830) like for example counting the ruler  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3832) which we shall  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3834) push the book again and bring it out but  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3836) the existing one is already good enough  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3839) it's clearly that that that  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3840) regulates all the issues with the rule  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3842) and what what the limitation of  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3844) obedience et cetera in in a in a in a  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3847) clear way but for that you have to take  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3848) all evidences if you take only a small  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3851) attack unless they beat your back and  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3853) that's all they invest you have or you  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3854) cannot triple only and against  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3855) comfortable and ignore all the other  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3857) things that even hide them then you are  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3859) bound to and to become a bit khali and  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3861) then they were other  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3863) more more more aware muslims who would  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3865) declare you'll be an african will fight  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3866) against you and you will be with regime  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3868) so are hostile islam like saudi arabia  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3870) and others will be fighting against you  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3872) they will be headed an enmity  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3874) until you come back to  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3875) the complete taking over  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3877) and committing to the whole scripture  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3879) not by not really living apart and  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3881) taking apart so the minute you believe  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3883) in some of it and leave a disbelieve in  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3885) somebody or take some of it and forsake  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3887) some of it  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3888) they will be definitely disputes and  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3890) unsplit  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3892) in the case of christian there is no way  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3893) back until until you know  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3895) so there will never all these unifying  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3898) confessions and so on all of this is  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3899) futile and it will never end until  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3902) you're  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3902) no way  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3904) or  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3905) for those who are still christian but  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3908) it's not going to end because that what  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3910) has been lost is so significant and has  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3912) been forsaken and some of these have  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3914) been banned out  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3915) there's no way they can't go back but in  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3917) the case of islam it's a very impossible  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3918) but for that you have to take all  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3920) evidences onboard  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3923) there's no other way if you if you don't  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3925) take the evidence on board  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3926) then then you are finished then you have  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3929) then you have factions you have splits  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3930) and so on  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3933) now address to the people of  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3949) eye here maybe it's yours too i ever

[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=3981) an enlightenment

[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4003) specifically the quran basically

[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4032) everything he's not going through the  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4033) old testament and the new testament  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4035) chapter  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4037) there's where they say this fabricated

[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4145) obviously the life of the prophet is

[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4151) expounding it further but the ketamine  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4153) being by selfies alone  
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4155) can guide

[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4165) that's your claim if that's really  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4167) because some people have  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4169) a clinging to a faith faith because they  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4171) are not from their parents that they is

[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4180) question for them it's a foregone  
[1:09:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4181) conclusion that's not true it's not a  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4183) problem for every individual is that my  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4185) belief and so on what i'm doing  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4187) doing it so to achieve allah pleasure or  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4189) is it for another purpose

[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4216) the light one light

[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4239) now you have concealed some of this  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4240) scripture you have forgotten they have  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4242) taken someone through okay let's forget  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4244) about the past our messenger came to  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4246) explain plenty of that and forgive some  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4248) of it but you have now a light under the  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4251) self-explanatory

[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4254) which is himself an evidence who brings  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4256) its own evidence in itself  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4258) with this one allah guides to  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4260) those who want to have the pleasure of

[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4302) check um got a question yeah  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4305) i'll read it out verbatim as the sheikh  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4307) is discussing the split among the  
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4309) believers and the scripture and how the  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4310) muslims split  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4312) does the concept and claim of being  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4315) have any sharia value  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4317) what i think he means is  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4319) so  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4320) sheikh he gone silent again  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4322) it doesn't have good even the word the  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4324) word uh the word rama say that  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4333) the muslims until today and the sunnah  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4335) also the muslims should not be  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4336) hallucinate muslims should be the people  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4338) of quran and the people of islam  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4341) and the quran says clearly  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4346) named you the muslims so they should be  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4348) added  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4353) uh  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4358) as a faction not as a functionality you  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4360) could say  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4362) i am one who studied hadith and devote  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4363) my full time to verifying and analyzing  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4365) hari that's that's that's like saying i  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4368) am a professional university doing  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4369) physics and others doing pharmacology  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4371) that's fine there's no problem that's  
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4373) not what it meant here it's my it's for  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4375) fractionalizing people who  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4377) claim to be different in crete the one  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4380) they claim they are different in creed  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4381) there is a problem  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4383) it couldn't be if they differ in that it  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4385) either is not agreed  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4388) obligatory secondary issues who should  
[1:13:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4390) not be able to different should not be a  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4391) wither of labeling and giving you a name  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4393) or it is a difference in fundamental  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4395) creed then it says one of them is in the  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4396) muslim and one of them is  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4398) can't be otherwise  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4402) so all these all these titles are  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4405) life-threatening and dangerous  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4410) of  
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4411) factions and claiming to be closer to  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4413) the truth and so on this all of them are  
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4415) not sanctioned and if you check them you  
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4417) will find each one has some fundamental  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4419) deficiencies  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4420) and sometimes even borderline  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4426) without them noticing it because if they  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4428) have not said they would have stepped on  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4429) back but it developed so and that we  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4432) layer on layer of of taking things out  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4435) of context and mutilating things until  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4437) you end you end with statement which end  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4440) being statement of  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4443) so this is this based off of uh usually  
[1:14:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4445) out of the concept of ijma and being  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4447) becoming a source of sharia  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4449) you know that's something that is  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4451) something else the correct ismart  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4455) overwhelming narration like the  
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4456) narration of the water and more than  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4457) tawatur  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4459) like ishmael  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4460) what is  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4461) that just give you just a hint what is  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4463) it that we know that for example the the  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4466) the the fajr prayer is storage although  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4468) it is for raqqa except in trouble  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4470) how do we know that  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4472) by people praying for from the time of  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4474) the prophet and every generation seeing  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4475) the business pairing door for while they  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4477) are settled not on trip  
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4479) and that is  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4486) anyone claiming that would be absolutely  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4488) full of islam that's ishmael is really  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4490) more like like the tawatar narration but  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4493) not narrating the action  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4495) it's not the words  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4497) what i mean is in this context for  
[1:14:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4499) example  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4500) it's almost become a narrative that  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4502) there's a thing called  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4504) and if you're not part of this club  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4505) you're signing off off with you they  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4508) said the same  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4520) catholic  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4533) this is the english version of the  
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4536) original words which is made the  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4537) community the community the community of  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4539) the comprehensive everyone the scatter  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4541) the colored church claim to be the  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4542) community comprehensive for everyone  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4545) but is gravity added by virtue of the  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4547) fact this became almost like an ishmael  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4549) of ulima  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4550) so  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4555) [Music]  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4564) it last time has been perfected for you  
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4570) they must then say then who is not in  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4572) jeremiah must be a catholic do they say  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4574) that  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4575) this is a deviant what's the meaning of  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4578) you must declare him to be a genuine  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4580) catholic then we don't need to call you  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4581) say we are islam  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4585) meaning  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4587) [Music]  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4596) that's the only way  
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4598) or you step back until you regard that  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4599) this is just a division of the muslims  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4602) this is all playing games with ishmael  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4604) and going around this had nothing to do  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4605) with ishmael in any case  
[1:16:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4607) i don't want to do it ishmael even if  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4609) it's someone trying to bring something  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4611) like  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4612) that the scholars  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4614) in a generation but this is this is this  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4616) ishmael has no no no warranty in islam  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4619) whatsoever what does what does it what  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4620) does it bring  
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4622) what does it bring us just bring  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4624) anything new which was not already  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4626) concluded  
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4628) if it is so then the deen is not  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4629) complete then you are creating a new  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4631) deen or if it brings only that expose it  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4634) then it must be have been explored  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4635) before and so on cannot be it cannot be  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4638) hidden until now  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4640) and then suddenly you expose it so it  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4642) must have been exposed by the sahaba by  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4643) tabi and as i said the number of  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4646) uh requires for  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4648) for the non-trafficking  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4654) or similar things  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4656) like  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4657) profit sharing someone giving the money  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4659) and someone working that was used by the  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4661) arabs and it was number five and  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4663) and clearly  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4664) everyone agreed that they were never  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4666) objected to that actually you have  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4667) narration that he approved that and con  
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4670) and recommended that abbas is doing that  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4672) he was happy that i was doing that but  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4673) he's not irrelevant even if he's not we  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4675) know that has been the approximate time  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4676) of the prophet until now  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4679) continuously nobody has ever said it is  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4682) is an invalid uh uh operation  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4686) fine details maybe and contractual  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4687) points maybe that focus  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4690) discuss  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4713) because in travel you should not make  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4715) any sunnah except uh  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4717) and so on this is also ishmael  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4720) well you don't need scholars  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4722) that's the only thing  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4724) is that allah is one he's not a trend he  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4726) is ishmael  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4727) if you believe a certainty you're not a  
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4728) muslim you're a christian  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4730) christian  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4732) that's that's only what ishmael could be  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4734) so this is all this is all just playing  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4736) games and usually they invoke ishmael to  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4739) to pervert their falsehood and they lie  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4741) about that  
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4742) and eventually specializes they said all  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4744) scholars agreed or most focus or  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4746) linguist agreed the moment you see  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4748) everything is saying all agreed on  
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4750) something else then you should lift  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4752) the red flag there's the danger or the  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4754) second flag like a car racing slow down  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4756) there's some problem here the only thing  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4758) he talks about is ma then you know this  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4760) problem  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4762) he may be not necessarily lying  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4764) deliberately but as there is escape  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4766) route he gets  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4767) or he will say the son of all the son of  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4770) all the salaf on that then oh lift the  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4772) flag all the salaf  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4776) so sorry just uh an additional comment  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4778) they called classical scholars which  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4780) seemed to give them ammunition  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4782) so you know it's almost like i don't  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4785) wouldn't call intellectual terrorism but  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4786) when they add gravity all these scholars  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4788) agreed that kind of builds kind of  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4790) narrative so the term  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4793) when did it creep in  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4796) who's called who who's called the old  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4798) scholar who's gonna give me give me a  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4800) list of them who agree  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4802) or the best things they said no there  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4804) are some disagreement i can't get you  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4806) there let me just research the matter  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4810) like for example they will tell you  
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4812) there's agreement that there's only  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4813) horus in the case of clear cover yeah  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4818) that's not true  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4819) because the one rebuilder with hajj not  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4821) all of them declared it to be a  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4822) cathedral committee clerical something  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4826) he did  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4826) but that's what nothing was ablation and  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4828) bloodshed  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4830) which he claims he's doing to the  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4831) khawaris that's not clear coffee  
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4833) almost like he's a cavalry  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4834) but he has bringing an argument  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4837) so i'm kidding  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4840) who are killing the people on the  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4841) streets  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4842) you cannot declare that to be clear  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4845) although sometimes he made some some  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4846) some some statement which i'll kill you  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4848) like i said anyone telling me beware of  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4850) allah in this message we're going to cut  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4853) his neck  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4853) that's a statement of khalifa  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4857) because this is no no justification for  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4859) any telling you anything to kill him  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4860) because of that this is impossible this  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4862) cannot be justified so he had click over  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4864) not all of them rebuilt because of that  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4870) so  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4871) there would be always counter example  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4872) for the claim that the momentum and  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4874) bring is there's a question mark  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4876) especially if it's about something which  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4878) there clear evidence of quran and sunnah  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4880) and and overwhelmingly well establish  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4882) history that's not true and this is  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4884) usually invoked by madhhab  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4888) that's usually like whatever what's  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4890) happening there  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4893) so this is all because because they are  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4895) playing because if they go and get the  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4898) evidence from quran and sunnah and  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4899) analyze that putting the table well  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4901) developed like we do for example without  
[1:21:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4903) self praise inshallah hopefully  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4905) that we do we bring all the evidences  
[1:21:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4907) all the hadith and the counter evidence  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4908) and so on analyze the islam and so on  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4910) and the ayaat and the various  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4911) interpretation go to tabari what he said  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4914) is he saying persuasive or not and then  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4916) put everything together then we may come  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4918) to a point of view which is based on all  
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4920) these evidences which is strong and  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4922) persuasive  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4926) they don't do want to do that because  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4928) they know it will immediately fly out  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4935) like for example the hadith we say  
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4937) should we there would be a rule of this  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4938) and this then this negative as a hadith  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4940) of alpha numeric and they said should  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4941) not we fight them with the sword should  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4943) we not kill them  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4944) they said  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4946) they established prayer what's the  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4947) meaning of established prayer  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4950) this is interpretation  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4952) establish islam  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4954) because clearly if they if they for  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4956) example  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4958) allow allow brothers in the islamic  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4959) domain  
[1:22:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4961) or allow user a banking they did notice  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4963) they they committed comfort so they did  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4965) not establish prayer  
[1:22:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4966) so establishment is not only praying the  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4968) masjid or allowing in the muscular  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4970) masjid to be open this must be more than  
[1:22:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4973) that so it's a metaphoric  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4976) established prayer  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4978) meaning meaning they can abolish the cut  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4980) no it's impossible  
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4984) so there must be  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4985) metaphorically  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4988) established what's being established in  
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4990) what is what is the essential part which  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4992) is your regard as your broken the deen  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4994) in such a way that rebellion is the  
[1:23:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4996) other hadith that's which be translated  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=4998) now it says the imams will be from  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5000) quraysh this is the report the imam  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5002) should be from college as long as that  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5003) for a certain time then they will be  
[1:23:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5005) removed that's under a hadith i will  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5006) finish also the research about that  
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5009) quality that being is not a condition  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5010) for imam but this is secondary i said  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5014) and  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5016) i have a right over don't i have a right  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5018) over you they said yes you have a right  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5019) to us as as a head of state and as we  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5022) said  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5023) but as we said  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5025) they have also similar right as long as  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5027) they  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5028) and that he created in  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5031) increasing iran as if they ask for mercy  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5034) they grant mercy if they make a covenant  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5036) or a promise they fulfill the covenant  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5037) and the highest one if they rule they  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5039) rule with justice  
[1:24:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5041) andrew does not do that  
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5043) allah allah scares in the case of the  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5045) angels and the case of all people in him  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5047) but that's not that's that's the main  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5049) hadith which you find everywhere  
[1:24:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5051) quoted in every book  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5054) because the less the other part is so  
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5056) terrifying that led people almost to  
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5058) face exclusion from some some rulers  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5061) said  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5062) if they don't do that these three at  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5065) least the maximum one the most about the  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5066) ruling with justice then took you put  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5068) your sword on your shoulder and  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5070) exterminate them  
[1:24:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5074) and accelerate them fight them to  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5076) extermination  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5077) externally green cut their green away  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5081) otherwise you will become  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5083) hapless miserable selfs who live from  
[1:24:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5086) their priming the ground  
[1:24:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5088) at the time of it this hapless steps  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5090) will live with them at the lowest class  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5092) controlled by feudal lords be like that  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5094) that's really what that will end being  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5097) that's a clear call for for arms  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5102) that's that part of the hadith had been  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5103) hidden because some people faced almost  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5105) execution because of that when they  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5106) narrated it  
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5109) so this gives a more structured details  
[1:25:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5111) what should be expected from the ruler  
[1:25:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5113) the only good justice  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5115) and we know with all of justice  
[1:25:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5117) giving everyone his rights according to  
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5119) the law and they call the law the law  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5120) which is enacted  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5122) at least what is agreed upon  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5124) and no dispute about it  
[1:25:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5130) so  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5134) so if you take all of that on board you  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5136) have a structured theory of winterbell  
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5138) for the ruler  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5152) and even if there's a preference over us  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5156) preference someone is prepared also  
[1:25:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5159) bring an example for that for example if  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5161) you are working at a company and they  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5162) give at the end of the year or christmas  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5164) some bonuses you might feel someone who  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5166) was given larger bonus than you and you  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5169) think you will deserve the same bonus  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5173) that's according to judgment of the  
[1:26:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5174) management maybe he's doing his message  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5176) he may do it but but this is not a good  
[1:26:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5177) reason to rebel that's the meaning of  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5179) the hadith even if he'll feel something  
[1:26:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5181) someone has been prepared over you are  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5183) rightfully but preference is something  
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5185) different their answer says that and  
[1:26:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5187) obey even if they are mistreated or our  
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5189) rights are deprived that's not that  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5190) that's not  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5192) even the translation they're cheating  
[1:26:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5194) with the translation and the betrayal  
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5196) but that's what he says  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5198) but unless you see clear evident cover  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5200) and even know who israel darwish really  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5202) in political issues said clear cover  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5204) cannot be understood from the side of  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5206) the ruler except that commanding martial  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5208) openly  
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5222) until you kill this person say why  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5224) whether what's the court ruling say i'm  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5226) ordering you to kill it just like my  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5227) arbitrary that's cool  
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5230) that's enough for to pursue the  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5232) possibility and like his neck  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5234) you should put the sword and strike his  
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5235) neck instead that's it  
[1:27:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5237) if you can  
[1:27:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5239) and if you stay respect yourself  
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5241) it's even ahead by the muslims which is  
[1:27:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5243) even more qualified and developed  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5244) further in the hadith i just mentioned i  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5246) mean shall example  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5248) that's where the most disputed with  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5249) these groups is about this about the  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5251) ruler and how to deal with the rulers  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5252) that's it  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5254) that's most of the dispute about that  
[1:27:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5256) and they added to the spices about  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5258) issues of qatar and all these just to  
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5260) defer justify all of these things and  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5261) play this game  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5263) but the main dispute is this about  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5266) rulership  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5268) for sure most of these are just either  
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5270) government scholars or people who have  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5272) lost the courage and the energy to  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5274) confront the tyrants and you shall say  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5277) oh we cannot confront the talents we are  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5279) weak or we are covered  
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5280) they come develop a philosophy of  
[1:28:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5282) cowardice  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5284) it's okay to say i am covered i can't  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5286) fight i am unable to fight i will stay  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5288) home and attend my family and can i shut  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5290) my mouth fine have the ladders okay  
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5291) that's all that you can but come  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5293) publicly and say no no make a theory for  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5295) that and develop a structured theory and  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5297) start start cheating in the translations  
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5299) and so on and even fabricating a hadith  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5302) like muawiyah and his cohort has been  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5303) doing we have detected the number of  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5305) cables  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5306) it will be soon  
[1:28:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5319) this that  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5321) then you know there's something fishy  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5325) you know that there is something fishy  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5328) yeah  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5328) but this may be worthy of a similar  
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5331) issue by itself when we come hazard or  
[1:28:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5333) have come maybe we will have classes for  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5334) that or something  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5337) i think we  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5338) we may do one eye at least  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5341) this is now with the the  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5344) the christian  
[1:29:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5345) of the one together  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5348) specifically now correcting that for  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5350) demetrics until now until that they may  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5352) be excused by ignorance they'll have  
[1:29:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5354) some crips that are being lost they may  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5356) be taken or right by someone mentally  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5358) deranged or mischievous like like paul  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5360) that has the paul of tarsus  
[1:29:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5363) um he may be mentally delayed he may be  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5365) receivers we don't know that's not  
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5366) relevant if they can  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5368) he  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5369) increase the the christ above his rank  
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5371) and make him almost embodying the whole  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5373) divinity without saying that he's a  
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5374) divine being he said on the lord he say  
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5376) he's a god they always say everywhere  
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5378) there's we know there's only one god  
[1:29:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5380) but christ is lord without what's the  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5382) meaning of lord and god he's very  
[1:29:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5383) confused and and obscure  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5386) but most scholars say that he believed  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5388) that christ somehow divine  
[1:29:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5390) without making him a god in the full  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5392) sense like the father the almighty  
[1:29:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5396) and that developed then it was more  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5397) structured complicated theory of  
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5399) atonement et cetera later on oh that's  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5401) all forgiven in the past you didn't have  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5403) enough information scripture you don't  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5404) have  
[1:30:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5426) indeed the truth did not indeed the  
[1:30:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5429) truth that they deny they who say behold  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5433) god is the christ son of mary  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5435) say  
[1:30:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5436) and who could have prevailed with god in  
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5438) any way had it been his will to destroy  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5441) the christ son of mary and his mother  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5443) and everyone who is on earth all of them  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5446) for god's is the dominion over the  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5448) heavens and the earth and all that is  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5450) between them  
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5452) he creates what he wills and god has  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5454) power to dwell anything so that's the  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5456) power  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5457) now declaration that after the coming of  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5459) the quran the revelation and the you  
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5461) should people the book both jews and  
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5463) christians commit to after that  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5466) if you have rejected the the situation  
[1:31:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5468) that allah has won and jesus is just a  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5470) human being and a great messenger of god  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5472) and so on then you have denied the truth  
[1:31:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5474) you are a catholic  
[1:31:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5489) they are kafir allah declared them to be  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5491) a kafir they have rejected that rule  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5494) and the answer under the letter  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5496) this  
[1:31:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5499) is clearly a son of maryam he was a  
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5500) human being he was walking on the earth  
[1:31:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5502) and they claim he is embodying of god  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5504) somehow or allah became a muslim became  
[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5506) flesh all of this whatever the  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5508) technicality they say but as long as he  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5510) was in earth and there was a scripture  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5511) describing him he was working in earth  
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5513) eating etc  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5515) and also according to your claim he was  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5517) even crucified those who claim he is  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5520) allah he must be crucified otherwise  
[1:32:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5522) atonement does not make any sense  
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5524) yeah the atonement is that must be a god  
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5526) or his son must be sacrificed for the to  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5528) atone for the original sin  
[1:32:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5530) genuinely himself other doesn't make any  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5532) sense so this small answer to the the  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5535) egyptian church which is uh which is  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5537) called the monophysi  
[1:32:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5541) is god in unfold they say that's it  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5544) this is the full godhead this is one one  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5546) one nature is one one divine being  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5550) the divine and the human have mixed  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5551) completely into into under the messiah  
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5554) but this one has died on the cross who  
[1:32:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5557) can't prevent allah from destroying him  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5558) destroying his mother and if the jews go  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5560) were able to destroy him of course by  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5562) him then allah is even more capable and  
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5564) the whole they can't believe it allah  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5565) from destroying anyone on the earth  
[1:32:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5567) nobody can  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5568) and they admit that nobody can and allah  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5571) owns everything in heaven and concerning  
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5572) that he has been created as a unique way  
[1:32:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5577) allah created what he wants he can  
[1:32:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5579) create  
[1:33:00](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5580) immediately out of nothing he can't  
[1:33:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5582) create out of uh  
[1:33:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5584) clear  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5585) create  
[1:33:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5587) he said without a father he created  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5589) adam  
[1:33:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5590) we know he has a father mother of birth  
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5592) they were in animal level they did not  
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5594) become conscious so you can see he is  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5596) created over long chain from dust  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5599) if people die and the yamaha they're  
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5601) created essentially out of nothing they  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5603) go on from nowhere  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5605) just from the information shall have  
[1:33:26](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5606) been with them and they recreate them  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5609) in various ways and various forms of  
[1:33:31](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5611) creation  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5612) and allah is capable of all things so if  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5615) their argument is that erisa is uniquely  
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5618) uh  
[1:33:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5619) have a unique birth that's not a good  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5621) argument because allah is capable of  
[1:33:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5622) doing that  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5625) so whenever this is all just to comment  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5627) on various aspects of that what what led  
[1:33:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5629) to that claim but the reality is that  
[1:33:51](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5631) that claim is is itself obviously  
[1:33:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5634) rationally contradictory is not  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5635) warranted by the scriptures in their  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5637) hand not enforced by scripture but at  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5639) least say at least take a look  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5642) was clearly no divinity of christ or  
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5644) even atonement is there whatsoever  
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5646) and this respectable scripture which has  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5648) to be taken on board and synchronized  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5650) with the others and brought into harmony  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5652) there's no way you can forgot completely  
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5654) others for it forget it and then  
[1:34:34](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5674) i think we stop here because another  
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5677) topic will start after that and i think  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5679) we have i think sufficient time  
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5682) spent today  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5684) and we will continue with the eye about  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5688) the jews and christians say there we are  
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5689) the children of allah and his darling  
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5693) battle for them that's iron number i  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5695) think 20 yeah and in our count is  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5698) 18  
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5707) his beloved ones  
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5709) and rebuttal for that  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5711) excessive  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5712) claim okay  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5714) okay having any any questions from zoom  
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5717) i have any questions on um  
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5720) the youtube channel outstanding yet  
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5723) um  
[1:35:25](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5725) i do have quite a detailed question on  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5727) the  
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5728) um  
[1:35:29](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5729) discussion around economics uh some of  
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5732) the transactional questions last week uh  
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5735) yeah this is about some transaction  
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5737) things like that maybe we should before  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5739) next week we should do that before leave  
[1:35:41](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5741) it next week and i was thinking also  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5743) that for example that say the basic  
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5745) ruling of contracts after miscibility  
[1:35:47](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5747) etc but i wanted to show that uh some  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5750) some contracts which were  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5752) run but in the west  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5754) like repurchase agreement like covenants  
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5757) or real estate like you if you wear how  
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5759) buy a house you will find suddenly in in  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5761) in the registry that there's a covenant  
[1:36:03](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5763) that you you don't do this or you do  
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5765) that and so on all of these are  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5767) conditions with the sales contract which  
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5769) make it invalid which is prohibited  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5771) specifically by messenger of allah i  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5773) will discuss that and show the wisdom  
[1:36:14](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5774) even um the result of everything these  
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5777) what what what it prevents yeah so let  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5780) us do it the first half next week  
[1:36:21](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5781) inshaallah okay would you be streaming  
[1:36:23](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5783) that as well because it's worth it oh

[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5787) separate it  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5788) also the other thing is uh you were  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5790) gonna look into the quest you know the  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5792) issue about rebellion as well yeah  
[1:36:35](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5795) that's that's we have to maybe maybe do  
[1:36:37](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5797) with a special session separately from  
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5798) tabs here okay we'll see inshallah okay

[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5804) meantime if you need to use that  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/oQl8h10_hWk?t=5806) reference point
