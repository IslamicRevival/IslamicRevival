 discusses the various hypotheses regarding the meanings of certain verses of the Qur'an. One of the hypotheses discussed is that certain verses point to Muhammad Ali, the boxer. Dr. Ahmed Muhammad Zain argues that this is a plausible hypothesis, and provides a PDF of his paper on the subject.

They also mention a theory that alif lam may be the two most commonly used words in the Qur'an, and that this points to the divine name Allah. He goes on to say that all these arguments need to be reshaped, as the Qur'an does not contain Syria, Syriac, or Arabic.

* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYUtS8a5hU&t=1200)* Discusses Tafsir-ul-Quran by Almassari. It states that Tabari's version is a slimmed-down version of what the Companions and tablers said about al-Baqara, and that he makes his final conclusion with the dropping of all these narrations. It goes on to say that a scholar who wants to do scholarly work should see what sahaba and tabling said about these topics and make sense of it. Tabari is mentioned as the author of this tafsir, as he accumulated what has happened in history, and he has sound judgement. It is also important to study him because he is not an extreme in terms of attacking every narration, as he knows that even a Prophet who is awake may not enjoy the correct information. Finally, it is mentioned that Al Albuquerque may have been misled by his kabbalah studies, and that the Quran refuted the story mentioned in that graduation ceremony.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYUtS8a5hU&t=1500)** Tabari provides a reasonable explanation for why different texts of the Quran may have different interpretations.

This concept is reinforced by the idea that the Qur'an is a guidance, or "ilm", to humanity.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYUtS8a5hU&t=2400)** discusses how Allah has the ability to intervene in the affairs of the world, and how he was not surprised by the events of the past. He goes on to say that this implies that all of the possible outcomes are known to Allah, and that he can always intervene to rectify any mistakes that may be made.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYUtS8a5hU&t=2700)* Discusses the Hadith which states that if Qatar is correct, nothing will prevent it from reaching its destination, except if it is correct. The narrator provides a translation of the Hadith into English, and discusses how different translators have interpreted it. He then provides his own interpretation of the Hadith, which is that Qatar is protected from evil by taking action to protect itself.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYUtS8a5hU&t=3000)* Discusses the importance of having a god awareness, as this will help protect oneself from punishment in the afterlife.

The people who were guiding him told him that repentance is not possible for him because he has not made a commitment to change.

 provides a detailed interpretation of the Qur'an verse 2:255, discussing the different approaches to understanding scripture by medieval scholar Ibn Arabi and contemporary scholar Jason. Although Ibn Arabi is considered a more spiritual and visionary scholar, Jason is more able to communicate his ideas effectively. Ibn Arabi's approach is more biased and contentious, while Jason's is more rational and respectable. Both scholars have valuable lessons to teach; Ibn Arabi in his ability to see the spiritual side of scripture, and Jason in his ability to communicate effectively across different sects and cultures.

[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=29) we mentioned quite a number of  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=31) coincidences and interesting i would say  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=33) miraculous aspects  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=35) but this has to be thoroughly more  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=37) thoroughly done than what you did and it  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=38) has to be there must be some  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=40) some work done about that more  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=44) comprehensively for example  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=45) a guy let me tell you his name  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=56) wrote  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=69) and he has quite a number of things that  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=70) obviously i i need to go through these  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=72) and verify them and was  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=73) relying on the reading which we did not  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=76) regard as the super supreme one in  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=78) matter of counting as well but it  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=80) it it may be slightly relevant because  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=82) it has nothing to do with the number of  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=84) eyes and so on  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=85) and uh being qatar being single eyes or  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=87) no single eyes or part of the ayah  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=89) it has to be other structures so it may  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=91) be valid or even in our reading  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=93) or we could say that is allah did not  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=97) allow the house reading  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=98) which is the weaker one of the of  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=102) the house is the second one the first  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=103) one is not house  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=105) other one what's his name uh i think  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=107) sure anyway  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=109) is the second one still allah allowed if  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=112) we assume the  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=113) allow this one to be reserved and  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=115) literally all the eastern muslim world  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=117) is until people think quran is the house  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=119) version  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=120) but that's for them the quran is that  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=121) one they have no imagination any other  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=124) quran  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=124) or any version of the quran but we have  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=127) stressed at the beginning that really  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=129) the  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=129) divergence which uh having an  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=130) interesting aspect and coincidence  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=132) is uh uh the reading of nafta with the  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=135) two channels  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=136) so two chosen master challenge which is  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=138) uh  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=140) which is why it spread in libya and up  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=141) to tunisia and then wash which is what's  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=143) written in the far west and  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=145) areas of africa including senegal etc  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=148) and then we have  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=149) a battery reading one channel  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=153) which is spread in sudan south of new  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=156) york all the way down almost to the  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=158) um through the ethiopian border and  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=160) maybe a little bit in maybe maybe  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=162) chad and a bit of of not  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=165) not up to mali maybe for that nature in  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=168) niger maybe maybe in that area i'm not  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=170) sure but  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=170) we have to say but this is established  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=172) and people read it and there was i have  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=174) written over a thousand years now in  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=175) this visa so we said argued that this is  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=178) these two two readings and with the  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=180) three channels established that this is  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=182) the correct count  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=183) so it does not mean it is the correct in  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=185) every respect we have to  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=187) the the half house reading the helps uh  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=191) narration of the of the  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=194) uh awesome reading is also reserved  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=198) to be all both like like a contrast  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=200) maker and also maybe possibly corrector  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=203) so we have to some work has to be done  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=205) in that direction  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=206) so he's relying on the half reading and  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=209) having a considerable number of of  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=212) coincidences and amazing things about  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=214) her  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=215) and he has a various hypothesis for  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=216) example he has a  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=218) hypothesis that this horror indicate  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=221) each letter or each group of letters  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=222) indicate a certain word in the quran  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=224) for example his he argues with good  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=226) reasons  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=227) that alif lam is the two  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=230) most commonly the quran and also in the  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=233) name of the divine name allah  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=235) and he says this is pointing to the  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=238) divine name allah  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=240) the meme is pointing to the muhammad  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=242) starting with me etcetera he says  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=244) i said what this is and he verified  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=246) three or four of them  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=248) i said quite persuasive but all these  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=250) has to be reshaped again  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=251) so this is the so all this argument in  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=254) time passed one  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=255) or the argument was that they are they  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=258) are  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=260) some some some even claim that means  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=263) o man in in syriac and  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=266) people counter our counter that come to  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=269) that by saying but the quran  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=270) does not contain syria quran is in  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=272) arabic now syriac is a sub  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=274) subclass or or some directive arabic  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=276) arabic is the master arabic language  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=278) but original arabic is the mother of all  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=281) semitic languages so the original  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=283) semantic language if there is the mother  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=284) language which is out of that  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=286) is the ancient arabic which is obviously  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=288) different a little bit from the current  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=289) arabic but it seems to me having arab  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=292) declinations and conjugations similar to  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=295) what we have all through history and  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=297) this  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=297) expressed clearly for example in acadian  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=299) acadian is having declaration  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=301) and conjugation similar to the arabic  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=303) while hebrew has lost that and  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=305) it has lost that so that it may contain  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=308) something with syriac  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=309) which is like a dialect of arabic which  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=312) is okay this is  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=313) not the electoral arabic like it  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=314) contains some readings of the some other  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=316) dialects of the arabic and the arabic of  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=320) the  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=320) time of the quran so arabic is wider  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=322) than that that's number one  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=324) number two uh it is uh  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=328) it may be one of those exactly the  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=330) various layers of meanings  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=331) we said about taha etc maybe taha is  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=334) related for example to issues with  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=336) like this man is having a hypothesis  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=338) about that he did not go all the way to  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=340) try he said only four or five  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=341) verses and say the other things have to  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=343) be studied more thoroughly to see that  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=345) for example the second  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=346) a second the second argument or  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=350) hypothesis is that calf and sword point  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=353) to the quran so  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=354) alif lam  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=358) his third his third father  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=362) hypothesis is only hypothesis and try to  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=365) argue for them  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=366) and put them on the table to be  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=369) confirmed or falsified  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=370) like any scientific work uh half calf  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=373) fee if he in in the cafe  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=377) inside only is is point to the kitab the  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=379) first letter of kitab which is the quran  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=381) kareem  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=382) another name of the quran then he has  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=384) the pharaoh the  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=385) fourth fourth hypothesis the little meme  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=388) is  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=388) pointing to muhammad ali and he stopped  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=392) there  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=393) see he cannot read about that other  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=395) letters he does not have any  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=396) uh persuasive i think sad he has  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=400) a suggestion that may be related to  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=402) sarat  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=409) so that's that's one way there's other  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=412) ways that they can withdraw  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=413) in american coincidences and position in  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=415) the in the muslim discussion  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=417) so that's all uh but the simplest  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=420) and most trivial level which is  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=424) that these are arabic words  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=427) so it's in arabic it's in arabic it's  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=429) not chinese it's not english  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=431) it's definitely arabic alif these are  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=433) arabic letters of the arabic language  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=436) from those the quran is composed not  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=438) composed out of  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=440) heavenly material or supranational  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=442) theories from this material  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=444) the language will show which you haven't  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=446) used someone could say this  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=447) actually exists in allah's knowledge in  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=450) asean in eternity  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=451) maybe but we don't go through such  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=453) speculative things  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=454) so they are somehow not created in that  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=456) sense  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=458) maybe that could be about words or words  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=461) really created other meanings and so on  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=463) creating the sims  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=465) that's obviously a deep question related  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=467) logic and philosophy and what is created  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=469) what's what's the part of the being of  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=471) allah which is not created  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=472) and what's created etc whatever it is  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=475) could be that could be  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=476) but we are not going to go into these  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=478) philosophical issues with deep going and  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=480) not very important and relevant but in  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=481) this in the simplest level from these  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=484) letters which you know which is in your  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=485) language  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=489) from these letters is that that book is  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=491) is fashion this this  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=492) this book is is composed of  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=496) and you are the people of poetry the  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=498) people of oral culture  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=499) show show me your muscles question  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=502) something similar  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=503) and something miraculous that's that i  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=505) would say this is level zero  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=508) is there a button we'll discuss with the  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=510) hadith about what into up to seven  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=513) internals yeah  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=516) there may be other button one of these  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=519) is for example  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=520) how deep it is i don't know the  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=521) miraculous nature and so on etcetera  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=523) etcetera and maybe another part and  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=525) giver is that  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=526) every data is pointing to a certain  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=527) divine name or the prophet name or a  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=529) certain  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=530) important aspect of islam like salah etc  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=533) but that still is a open for his age but  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=536) almost certainly the issues with the  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=538) with the position in the in the quran  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=540) this is your numbering with discussion  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=542) with  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=542) is cannot be a coincidence it is  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=544) deliberate and in a book which has been  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=546) revealed  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=547) rewritten and re-edited and rewritten  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=549) recompiled over 23 years  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=551) by an illiterate man which is and by  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=553) other people who  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=555) simply did not know where to put things  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=557) until put this ayah here  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=559) so it is rather russian inconceivable  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=562) that what we have already said  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=564) could be just an accidental that's  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=566) myself miraculous that's i think that's  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=568) enough  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=568) but more can be added to it and make it  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=570) absolutely irrefutable  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=572) so some work should be done in that  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=573) because i think this  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=575) contain considerable secrets of the  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=578) quran  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=579) and should be pursued further so this  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=580) this gentleman was his name again let me  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=583) so  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=583) so give him credit for that his name is  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=586) dr ahmed muhammad zain and manawi  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=588) he's an egyptian and uh  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=592) he argues actually nicely i have i have  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=593) the pdf somewhere i can send it to the  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=596) show  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=596) it's in arabic obviously though but for  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=598) those who are arabic it may be  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=599) interesting to  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=600) and verify some of these things and  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=602) can't go through and then check that  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=604) it's go  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=604) based on a consistent as i said he rely  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=608) on  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=609) on the house reading we could say allah  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=610) present the house reading to be always  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=612) your contrast  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=613) to be corrected for the number of ayah  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=615) to indicate  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=616) certain things but it may have its own  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=617) merits by itself otherwise would not  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=618) have been  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=619) because they have so in the house  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=620) reading by itself as it's done  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=622) these certain miraculous aspects may  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=624) appear which cannot appear in the other  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=626) readings  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=627) so if actually each reading has a  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=629) certain miraculous aspect that's also  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=631) a valid and reasonable point of view and  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=634) and then the argument for that is not  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=636) arbitrary  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=637) argument for that is that these have  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=639) been the one who publicly  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=640) preserved there are many other readings  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=642) in the books and in  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=643) in the specialist literature and so on  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=646) but something which has been publicly  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=648) but  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=649) read by the people i've written they  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=650) must have almost for the last thousand  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=652) years  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=653) everywhere in this arabic word are these  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=655) half from asia all the eastern islamic  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=657) world  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=658) india pakistan they don't know quran  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=659) except the house of house when they come  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=661) to households  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=662) which is not the previous account by the  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=664) way as we discussed earlier  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=665) then we have uh the the other  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=668) narration uh only one one channel of  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=671) narration of uh  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=684) and he has various various narrators we  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=687) have turi  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=688) dory is narrating another with his  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=689) called when he narrates  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=695) this is the one spirit in sudan and then  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=697) we have the most important that  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=699) everyone agrees the closest one to the  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=701) sahaba we're reading that qurayshi  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=703) and the motherly directors is the  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=707) this is the reader himself the master  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=709) leader the number one the highest  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=710) respected most regarded as the most  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=713) authentic and most most  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=715) sophisticated leader but we have two  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=717) channels of narration the two main  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=718) channels the first one is kaloon  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=721) which is written and read by the people  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=723) of libya and around  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=724) since thousands of years  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=728) physically in our hand and then we have  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=730) varish which is more in the far west of  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=733) libya and also in andalusia before and  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=734) lucia gone so we have these  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=736) so why these have been conserved  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=740) the divine hand if the quran the divine  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=742) head must be held behind that  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=743) if it's not a divine heart it's not what  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=745) is this okay then it is  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=747) that they show these miraculous aspects  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=749) each one by itself  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=751) is standing at shocking which proves  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=753) that the hypothesis that's not with them  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=756) by the divine hand beyond their  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=757) comprehensive conservation is  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=759) definitely false we can refute that  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=762) that's it's a  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=762) concept that wasn't just about  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=764) historical accent which nobody  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=766) knows no no it's not historical accident  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=768) it's it looks like a swelling but behind  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=770) that  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=770) behind the veil is the divine hand okay  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=775) and according to this gentleman  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=783) points to the divine name the the the  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=786) expression of majesty allah  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=788) which sounds very logical and the way he  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=789) argued is is persuasive but need to be  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=792) very verified and again because it's  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=794) counting letters and counting positions  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=796) which need to be verified i think the  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=798) best is that to enter all the quran as  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=800) it does as as a script as initial script  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=803) not as pronounced as script  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=805) in out many script originally without  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=807) vowelization and so on  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=809) and uh in interest in  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=812) a in in a text file and no touch heel  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=816) nothing  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=817) and then having a phishing program which  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=819) can't because counting letters  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=821) by hand i try to call submitters with a  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=823) nightmare every time i count to get  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=825) another count because i make a mistake  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=827) here or skip this one  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=828) but the computer program should be able  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=829) to do that but we have to get the text  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=831) first  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=832) as closely as possible to whatever what  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=835) is that money writing is  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=836) going to all this possible uh and then  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=839) go from there  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=841) so that's that's the last one uh and the  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=843) meme may be wanting to muhammad ali  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=846) could be anyway then it is the next ayah  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=849) without the  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=849) continuation of the eye because our  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=851) preferred uh count of eyes is that  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=853) iflaming is not a separate eye but at  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=856) which is another way of count which can  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=858) be having its own  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=860) merits and miraculous aspects  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=881) indeed no doubt in it  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=885) in itself in that in that book there's  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=887) guidance for the  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=889) muta or we can make us  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=893) that book in which no doubt can exist  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=896) whatsoever that's from allah and that's  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=898) divine  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=900) that one book which no doubt in it  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=904) is a guidance so it is essentially the  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=907) same meaning but  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=908) a little bit different in flavor so if  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=910) you stop at after  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=912) there is no doubt is in the quran and  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=915) that quran is by itself  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=919) some some will realize that this is  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=921) stronger another one say no no it's for  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=923) me stronger than the meaning is that  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=935) in that book there's guidance from  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=938) turkey  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=941) so both meanings are both meaning are  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=943) obviously intended because you can read  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=945) and stop  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=945) you can separate the sentences and  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=947) everyone gives an extra meaning that's  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=949) one  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=949) of the interesting aspects of the quran  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=953) that you can say can stop sometimes in  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=955) various  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=956) places and they have two different  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=959) sentences which are  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=960) quite related but they have different  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=962) meaning  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=966) so  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=968) the scholars have discussed why why it's  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=970) pointing to the quran as being followed  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=972) with this  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=973) the one one as that that is that  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=976) pointing to the remote or the absent one  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=980) of the better explanation is that it is  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=983) usually pointing to someone present as  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=985) the absent one  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=986) is some kind of respect and horror and  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=988) this available in many languages like  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=990) you  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=990) you address for example someone who you  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=992) with whom you have a bit of distance  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=994) but respecting german for example  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=996) atheism at home they  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=998) the seasoned they are when you're  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1001) addressing a man in front of you  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1002) they are zen  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1007) you are a good man with students you are  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1009) say they are a good man and here you are  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1011) just seeing a man in front of you  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1013) so this is this seems to be some aspects  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1016) of certain languages which have  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1017) similarity in  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1018) in arabic and so on that's that's one  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1020) one possible explanation  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1022) there are many other explanation uh  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1025) arazi in his  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1026) book i i recommend this book uh  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1031) first of all because it is it uh  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1034) anyway the salafi the wahabi do not like  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1036) the book say it contains and some other  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1037) says  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1038) it contains everything except but this  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1040) is obviously  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1043) nonsense because he is his ashari and he  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1046) is  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1048) the people of theology and kalam the  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1050) book is full of issues of one  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1052) of the logic of philosophy and things  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1054) like that not all of them are sound but  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1055) it's full of that  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1056) because no book is given the book of  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1058) allies sound completely  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1060) you have to read everything critical and  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1063) and because they don't subscribe to  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1065) these schools and they don't have even  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1067) the  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1068) the education in that direction they are  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1070) deficient and they can't understand it  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1072) they're just unable they have not been  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1073) educated and given the tool to  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1075) understand that  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1077) um but actually it's really plenty of  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1080) issues there you know if in the book of  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1082) trade you will see also i wrote him in  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1083) certain places  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1084) we had where he made various  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1086) breakthroughs of importance  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1088) definitely it is the first class book of  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1090) tafsir  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1091) i give it a second place after the more  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1094) classical tabari  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1095) so for me tabari than razi amazingly the  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1098) one translator is available with many  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1100) people  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1101) uh underneath here many people like  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1103) level kurtobi i  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1105) i don't know i never developed a good  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1107) taste or maybe i'm biased  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1109) i never developed a good taste for  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1111) cortobi and my feeling it is  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1114) it is a bit shallow and uh  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1117) too much of a maliki persuasion more  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1120) more  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1120) more more parties and so on well not not  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1122) that open  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1123) and uh maybe so many points of view in  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1126) some places is excellent but  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1128) even career is more classical like a  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1130) tabari  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1131) but he has he because he is hadith  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1134) specialist also  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1134) he improves on various things and  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1136) although he in his full cursive  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1138) not the abridged version they're made by  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1140) other people he has  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1143) plenty of hula fathom  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1146) stories which are just fantastic  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1149) just just should be just just ignored  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1152) but that was at his time regarded as  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1155) science or a possible explanation  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1157) and he mentioned such stories and so on  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1159) although he never mentioned them as a as  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1161) a proof or  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1162) definitely true or something like that  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1164) but still he  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1165) did not hesitate in importing them and  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1168) making them as a possible interpretation  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1170) which is okay that's scholarly  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1171) acceptable it's no problem  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1172) you take whatever material available at  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1174) your  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1176) time at your your your current time  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1179) and all the information and try to work  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1181) in it because the quran is supposed to  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1183) be  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1184) well never ending miracle that is uh  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1189) it is amazement never ends and it does  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1192) not  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1193) become old by repeating you repeat it  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1196) and never become old and boring  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1198) every time you repeat it it sounds nice  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1200) it's out but also  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1201) if you have related you may gain some  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1203) new meanings  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1205) so that this is this order so i will  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1207) recommend  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1208) i don't i'm not sure if it's translated  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1210) if it's translated in full  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1211) it will be really a good breakthrough  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1213) but probably i think  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1216) you know i think is at least a slimmed  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1218) down version is translated  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1220) slim to a version meaning what the w  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1222) after the power emission all the various  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1224) narrations are what have been narrated  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1225) from  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1226) the companions and under and tab in  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1228) followers etc  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1230) then he makes his final conclusion so  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1232) the so-called tabari tafsir the slimmed  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1234) one is just  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1235) bring the eye and then his final  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1237) conclusion  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1239) with the dropping all these narrations  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1241) that may be  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1242) good for someone who is in a in a hurry  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1244) but someone who wants to do some  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1245) scholarly work  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1246) it's important to see what sahaba and  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1248) tabling was saying about these things  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1250) and and make sense out of them  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1254) so i would say tabari because he  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1256) accumulated what's happened  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1258) in have had and also he has some sound  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1260) and  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1261) good and also he is a matter of of  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1263) studying this  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1265) he is not he's not an extreme in the  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1267) sense that he just attacks every it's  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1268) not because it's weak or not because he  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1270) knows that even  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1271) awake is not may enjoy the correct  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1273) information under  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1274) correctness technically may end with the  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1276) wrong information because of reasons we  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1278) have discussed i think  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1279) many times that that the correct  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1281) relationship is not does not prove  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1283) with attitude because we cannot exclude  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1285) by necessity analysis  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1286) or mutual correlating narrations we  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1288) can't exclude this one of the narrators  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1290) although he's a trustworthy with the  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1292) first class  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1292) that he made a mistake here and confused  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1294) hadith we can't  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1295) exclude that for certainty like for  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1297) example i mentioned all this example  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1299) even going to a sahaba like in the  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1301) famous ahadith  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1302) this  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1306) give an example one of them instead  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1308) saying the hadith  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1309) where it's not for eve no female would  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1312) have betrayed her husband  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1314) this is definitely and he may claim that  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1317) he hid it from prophet if we check that  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1319) we find this text coming only from  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1320) amorera  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1321) and narrated by initially i thought it's  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1324) narrated by one movie who was a maybe  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1326) jewish background  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1326) and took that from the old testament it  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1328) turned out that eight or nine of the  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1330) first class narrator  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1334) or error or fabrication or lie must be  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1336) on albuquerque now i'm not claiming he's  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1338) the lying i say  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1339) most likely by sitting almost  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1341) continuously with kabbalah  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1344) who was narrating stories from the old  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1345) testament and all the legendary issues  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1347) there especially  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1348) in genesis here there in genesis eve is  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1352) the one who has guided adam and  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1353) persuaded him to eat from the tree we  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1355) know this is this is ally  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1357) definitely is a lie and the quran  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1359) refused that completely  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1361) how has nothing to do with that the one  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1362) who would survive allah and the one who  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1364) got her in trouble is adam will come to  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1367) the adam have a story down there  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1369) not far away it's not the baqarah so  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1371) what has happened there  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1373) because he had many times it's going  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1376) it fit in his mind with with what he  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1378) hear from the prophet and he thought he  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1380) had ruled  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1381) by the way there is a there is a website  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1383) i think our  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1384) youtube site which uh which discusses  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1388) issues of memory and so on and gives  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1390) tons of information about how memory  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1393) could fool you  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1394) the the one in one of them is an  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1396) interesting story let me mention that i  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1397) think it's worth mentioning  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1399) the man said mentioning some person say  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1402) yes and uh  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1403) in in in that graduation ceremony my  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1405) sister was attending with a  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1407) with a dress colored so and so on et  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1409) cetera and he remembers that  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1410) absolutely you would swear that it was  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1413) and he attended that  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1414) it turns out later on i think he's  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1416) telling that to his sister or someone  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1418) who was president  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1419) that his sister was not in that  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1420) graduation ceremony and she was not  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1422) wearing that  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1423) that that in her graduation if ever so  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1426) how his mind constructed that  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1428) and she was never in that graduate way  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1430) and there's evidence for that by  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1432) by recorded and written evidences that  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1435) she was never in that and she said  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1436) that myself  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1440) i remember there was one discussion with  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1441) my mother as a small child  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1443) say i i remember when when the  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1445) neighbor's house uh  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1447) caught fire and we left the house and so  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1450) on  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1451) he said how can you remember that i  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1453) remember  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1454) and i was singing from the window better  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1456) gaza  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1464) before you are born you must have heard  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1466) us talking about it and you fixed it in  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1467) your mind that you were  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1468) i witness or not lie with this  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1471) and there was a small child differently  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1473) i did not fabricate that by any  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1474) deliberation  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1475) so that's how i just tell you  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1478) don't be shocked that it could go in a  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1480) horrible eyes  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1481) and instead of being taken from kaaba he  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1484) believed  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1488) he did not say i never said that it can  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1490) and it cannot be the prophet or allah  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1492) would have said that which is contradict  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1493) the quran  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1494) which is manifestly fair false and just  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1496) pure legendary  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1497) and mythical that's example so just just  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1500) to make that straight from the first  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1501) point  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1503) so had it could be technically correct  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1506) will connect it actually this one with  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1509) this with this with this  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1510) scandal of of uh evp betraying adam  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1514) which is just a scandal never happened  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1516) uh narrated from abu hurayrah by tawatur  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1518) i think seven or eight was two nights at  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1520) the same so isabella is the responsible  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1522) one there's no escape of that  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1524) but until he stand up to and that's what  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1526) happened to almost certainly  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1529) got confused in his mind and they heard  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1531) that from kabbalah  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1532) who was narrating the old testament and  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1534) all these mythical stories that the  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1535) generous stories  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1536) of genesis specifically genesis because  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1538) the rest of the  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1539) of the so-called five books they are  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1542) actually written by moses and his  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1543) students  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1544) and recording the exodus from an israel  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1546) and their tribes and so on  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1547) that's more or less accurate but the  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1549) moment they go back in history  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1551) it is mixed with legendaries and most  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1553) likely it's written much later even  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1555) like according tax critic but we're not  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1556) going anything's critical answer  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1558) but this shows clearly that that the  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1561) people also there either fabricated  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1562) deliberately  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1563) or just got confused mixed some stories  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1566) here there  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1567) with that what they need from the  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1568) prophets etc the same habitat  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1570) there so that's the reason all these  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1573) books  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1574) should not be regarded as as protected  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1576) letter for letter and sentence for  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1578) incentives  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1578) even the sunnah is not like that the  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1580) protection is different like that  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1582) so we should we should get out of this  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1583) mentality of thinking that's this letter  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1585) for literally  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1586) because the hadith is muslim it is a  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1589) fact it's absolutely  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1591) and some of it is absolutely wrong like  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1593) this one  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1595) so back to the uh so that's the  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1597) variation so what  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1598) so tabari abstain from criticizing the  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1600) snap at all he took whatever came with  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1602) this not  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1603) and lifted for the leader to analyze and  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1605) himself he seemed to be  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1607) was not from the school which which uh  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1610) takes the issue with criticizing this  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1611) not too seriously  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1613) he regarded whatever is narrated there  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1615) is a possibility of error and the  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1616) possibility of  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1617) truthfulness and if whatever the level  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1619) of islam and even some men which have  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1620) been attacked and being weak and so on  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1622) he may be disagreed with that and in  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1625) most state  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1626) entire cases he seemed to be right in  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1628) that  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1629) so taking all summer summarizing all  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1631) evidences  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1632) uh he i think his his approach is a  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1634) reasonable approach  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1636) and does not mean that the final summary  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1638) he reached who is correct maybe  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1640) several families is correct but he  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1643) reaches a final summary which is a good  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1645) explanation  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1646) and a reasonable point of view which is  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1648) worth studying and interacting with  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1651) and razi as i said indulge in  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1654) plenty of speculative analysis and  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1658) philosophical and theological  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1661) interactions etc about the letters and  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1663) the divine origin non-divine origin and  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1665) so on  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1666) plenty of it is there is not persuasive  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1668) but it's good to see that see how the  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1670) minds have been working time past  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1672) to dissolve or to do to explain the  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1674) secrets of the quran and get out of the  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1676) because the quran has definite secrets  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1678) definitely  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1679) you remember when we put in a certain  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1683) order  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1684) uh it came with some interesting  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1686) sentences one of the sentence which is  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1688) indisputable is that nassau nassau  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1692) what was it let me see so that i don't  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1695) quote wrongly  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1700) but remember if we put them in certain  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1702) order we found three sentences  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1703) all of them have been have a good good  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1706) no  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1707) hakim a wise  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1711) perfect text which has a  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1714) definite secret or a cutting secret this  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1717) this is so that may be one of the  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1720) secrets of them  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1723) which itself's here it has a cell  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1725) culture so that's that's very  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1727) interesting  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1730) so that the quran is in in in eloquent  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1733) arabic  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1734) does not mean that it does not contain  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1735) something from the sub arabic and the  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1738) idealics  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1738) it may contain some of it and they are  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1741) part of the arabic language because all  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1742) these dialects are really subdirects of  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1744) the arabic because arabic  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1745) all the arabic of quraysh  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1748) which is the name in arabic at the time  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1750) of  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1757) language but still it is it is all of  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1760) these are arabic  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1761) so even if we say someone is from syria  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1764) meaning o man  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1769) does not undermine it's not arabic  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1772) it has been arabic it is arabic in the  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1774) origin because syriac is  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1776) some dialect of the arabic original  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1778) arabic and even the quraysh  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1781) and arabic which is  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1785) the most fascinating the most eloquent  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1786) arabic at the time of salam  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1789) which is someone said you are very  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1792) eloquent  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1793) say no wonder because i i speak the  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1795) tongue of the  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1796) the two cabins  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1802) these are two most elegant arm because  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1804) they are around  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1805) the way to madina the way to medina  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1808) obviously this tribe have scattered  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1810) after that but there's a time of  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1812) and you remember in the in the  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1813) immigration story when he stopped at the  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1815) tent of omaha but um and she gave him  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1819) the she gave it it gave them them she  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1822) received them  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1823) underwater or we played host for them in  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1826) a respectable way this is  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1828) omaha but uh the tenth of a map at the  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1830) famous place where the boys made with  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1832) said made a come down and have some some  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1834) food and so on offered by um  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1836) which became muslim later and husband  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1838) also  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1840) uh became allied and very close to the  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1843) prophet  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1844) because he has josiah mothers in his in  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1846) his lineage  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1847) up there so he they are his or his his  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1849) distant  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1850) maternal uncles yeah so  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1854) so that's that's that's uh that that's  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1857) the  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1858) the even if some of them are taken from  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1860) syriac it doesn't refute that or  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1862) contradict that the quran  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1863) is arabic but that may be one of the  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1864) hidden meanings  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1866) now we go to the ali especially  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1869) discussed why it is used in said  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1873) usually dalic is for the far or the  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1876) non-present for the present and near  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1880) it is hard this not that  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1883) like in english and he has various  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1886) arguments and issues there and so on  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1888) one of this refuting that that will be  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1891) used  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1892) also uh is unusable for the for the near  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1894) and  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1895) close which is not very best ways when  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1897) he mentioned exams the quran  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1899) all of them if discussed in detail show  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1901) that he's mistaken  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1904) actually they can be interpreted the way  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1906) i'm interpreting now  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1909) so the book which you want to do one one  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1912) one interesting aspect to say it's  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1915) wanting to the book which has been  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1916) because it's  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1917) to the far away because the one who  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1918) promised in development  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1920) when when moses asked allah to raise  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1923) and bury israel from themselves a  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1926) prophet like him  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1927) down the road because they will need in  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1928) the future because obviously told him  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1930) they will be misguided that they will  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1932) they will deviate and etc and allah  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1934) promised him to hear tourists from their  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1936) brethren that's in the old testament as  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1938) with this word from their brethren their  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1939) brethren it must be when you smile  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1942) there's no other  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1943) reasonable interpretation they may you  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1946) you may  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1947) they may try to go back and forth and so  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1949) on but there's no escape from that  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1950) someone like musa and then mentioned  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1953) some of his features and the quran  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1954) mentioned that  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1955) what they have in the old testament but  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1956) that is not complete quran  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1960) uh allah promised russell  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1964) that that his mercians want to be  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1965) allocated to do so follow the illiterate  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1967) messenger  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1968) who they find written in the in the in  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1971) the  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1972) in the in the torah and in the gospel uh  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1977) one of the main officials with messenger  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1979) that he allows all  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1980) all all good things and probably to all  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1983) evil things  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1984) and command good and forbid evil and  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1986) those who follow him are the ones saved  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1987) and won the one at the end of time  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1989) although we know that  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1990) the number of muslims who follow  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1991) muhammad s exceed the numbers from  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1994) followed by muslims  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1996) on proper guidance by biblical  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=1999) so it is pointing to that book which  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2001) will be promised on  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2003) that's that's a possible interpretation  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2005) my interpretation is that  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2007) varical kitab because the book which is  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2009) pointed to is not present and not  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2011) complete yet  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2012) that's my interpretation which relate  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2013) also to the issue which is a sword issue  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2015) which has been discussed  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2017) many issues related to the divine  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2020) preparing knowledge  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2021) and with the qatar etc is that  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2024) is the quran in existence in my  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2026) following divine knowledge  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2027) in eternity for the beginning of time at  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2029) the beginning of time  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2031) the correct point of view we have  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2032) discussed in qatar which is i'm going to  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2034) discuss in detail but we'll mention  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2035) where as we come along  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2037) and there's a book which will be  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2038) finalized in that direction is that  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2040) that's not true  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2041) quran as it says  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2053) and when the ayah came down the book was  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2056) not his complete  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2057) it's not wallah that would be complete  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2059) and he will take care that it will be  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2060) completed and the prophet will not die  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2062) until it's completed there's no doubt  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2063) about this is only decided by allah and  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2065) there's no way because allah  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2067) has the complete control of the of the  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2069) universe and the complete control of the  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2071) future so the  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2072) crucial is not a matter of being known  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2074) thereof contingency  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2075) but allah has complete dominance and  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2077) control over the future  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2079) so i would say dali kalkitab it points  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2082) to the book  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2083) and when it is completed which is not  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2085) yet at it's not present  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2086) so it is present it's only part of the  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2088) book not the book part of it is still  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2090) to come so that he can keep the one in  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2093) the divine knowledge  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2095) to be completed in due course  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2100) so i think that's that one of the best  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2102) interpretation  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2103) i would say of the various  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2104) administration is daley carey for the  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2106) uh for the absent and for the far away  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2110) because what has been present at that  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2112) time  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2114) is not the complete book like an  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2116) al-kitab the book  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2119) is the one which will still to be  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2122) completed down the road  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2123) and will be completed certainly  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2126) there will be a reference to it it will  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2128) be completed no  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2130) for power in the universe can ever  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2132) prevent allah from  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2133) for because he's the donor he is that  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2135) he's the supreme dominance of  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2137) jabbar he's the complete dominant of the  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2139) universe present and future  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2142) and past has been already done and  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2144) dominated and  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2145) certified and executed present his  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2148) complete dominance  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2150) complete dominance and the future is  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2152) under his complete control  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2154) so you say when you say what allah knows  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2156) of he knows whatever possible  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2158) possibilities are there whatever  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2160) contingencies  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2161) and which one materializes he has  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2163) complete dominance over it he can direct  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2165) things that he can allow things to  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2166) happen  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2167) even the things which will follow  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2169) because of the natural law by necessity  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2171) it's not a necessity for allah this is  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2173) it for the national law  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2174) allah can step in and bear when there  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2176) normally doesn't  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2178) and it goes according to that so it's  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2179) known it will be if you put the  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2181) kettle on the at the moment on on on  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2183) fire or  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2184) connect would exist if you have an  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2186) electrical kettle  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2187) in 34 minutes or one minute it will boil  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2191) that moment you put electricity allah  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2192) knows it will boil  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2194) but and he allows it to become boiling  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2198) otherwise it will not happen and if he  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2200) will chooses for whatever reason he can  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2202) step  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2202) in and prevent it from boiling whatever  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2204) meaning like for example  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2206) by by something which does not appear  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2207) miracle that electricity goes down  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2210) the near the near station uh uh  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2213) disconnect for example or for some  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2216) reason your your  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2217) your fuse jumps whatever or  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2220) with uh uh other other reasons for  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2222) example that you change your mind and  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2223) take the catalyst  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2224) point by motivating you to shade the  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2226) kitten for example for example etcetera  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2230) so all of that is all these conditions  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2232) are not all of that  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2233) for any reason you want to step in  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2235) normally he doesn't  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2237) but if you want to step in he steps in  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2239) and he change  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2240) whatever coming so the future is not is  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2243) not there  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2244) the future is to be created and nothing  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2246) will happen without allah permission  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2248) and nothing will happen to surviving he  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2251) will not be the state of shock  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2252) i didn't expect that everything every  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2254) possibilities are there and none of them  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2256) is out of uh outside his control  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2259) he has complete control and dominance of  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2263) modernity  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2264) that's i think the correct and they say  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2266) al-kitab the book  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2268) which is not presented this to be  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2269) completed according due course  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2272) according to the developments of the  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2273) future but it will be completed  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2275) certainly  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2276) whatever this happens it will be  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2278) completed there is no way it will  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2280) it will not be completed and no way  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2284) allah will fail that because of the  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2286) using al-kitab and pointing it towards  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2288) this to be completed is a promise from  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2290) allah that it will be completed and i  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2292) have the power to enforce  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2293) completion no other course was in the  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2297) universe will be able  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2299) to undermine my design and prevent me  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2301) from completion  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2302) so so this is akitab that's the word  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2306) fidelica i think the best interpretation  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2308) is that it's pointing to something  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2309) absent  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2310) and far away not present because what is  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2313) present is not  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2314) al-kitab some of the times  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2318) some of the hit up  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2321) so continue  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2324) with that that book when it is complete  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2329) there is no doubt when it is from allah  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2330) and completed by allah as promised by  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2332) allah  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2334) and it is either it is a guidance itself  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2337) or in itself in in italy's guidance  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2340) either  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2340) reading or stumbling after fee here or  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2343) before fee  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2344) it is guidance to the  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2347) it contains guidance  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2352) now  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2369) and also related to to this also  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2373) lends credence to the issue that really  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2375) the point of the book is the book which  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2376) is not yet complete it's not in that  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2379) when when they say that in my form  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2381) meaning in the divine knowledge  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2383) is the kinaya is a metaphor for the  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2385) divine knowledge there is no tablet  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2386) there  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2387) like this there's there's a narration  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2390) that  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2393) says he can make his dad based on what  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2396) he hear from people in the book and so  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2397) on  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2398) it is like a tablet 70 years long  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2401) made out of diamonds or out of samara  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2405) or something like that or jewel and  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2407) allah looks in it 360 times in the in  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2409) the day or something every minute i look  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2411) and  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2411) judge that song and uh want one set of  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2415) your heavies  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2416) i have to control myself not to like he  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2418) said  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2419) what is that whatever abba said i said  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2424) this is only the follicle for the divine  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2426) knowledge he said no no no it is it is a  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2429) tablet made out of jewels or something  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2430) like that  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2431) said you mean allah needs to look a  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2433) tablet to look up what's going on and  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2435) then he decides  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2436) when he newest state of shock this  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2439) clearly cannot be unnecessarily existing  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2440) being whose knowledge is a human being  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2442) and his knowledge is his or his  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2444) knowledge was exposes  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2447) not not just which we gained by by  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2449) experiences and  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2450) exposes his knowledge is creative  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2453) knowledge  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2454) it's not a passive knowledge like human  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2455) knowledge you look at the street and see  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2457) what's happening  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2458) and what's happening comes and it  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2459) presses through your mind you will or  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2461) you don't when it happens you close your  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2463) eyes  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2463) no no it was a state of shock  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2467) that's a problem when when in dick even  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2469) with habib rabbi says  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2470) as a if assuming rabbi said it assuming  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2473) it's happened  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2474) most likely he did not say that but  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2476) let's assume it said someone  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2478) had difficulty  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2487) divine knowledge it is it is protected  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2490) in the divine knowledge and the mind  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2491) knows that it's protected and it will be  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2493) completed  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2494) in a protected way and no one can can  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2497) undermine this protection or undermine  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2499) this revelation that's it  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2500) so so this so the guidance is also in  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2504) this in this  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2506) the guidance the quran will have  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2507) guidance for mutakin they can switch  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2509) ghana and find guidance and choose  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2511) guidance if they choose if they are  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2512) taking they don't want to gain something  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2514) else that will not guide them agree  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2515) misguidance for them by their own choice  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2517) all that is contain chances of the  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2519) future which will be actualized in due  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2521) course and  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2522) none of them is unknown to allah so that  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2524) he will be what the some  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2525) some people accuse the shia saying that  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2528) allah is having  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2530) something appeared to him which was not  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2531) available no it can't be that appealed  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2533) to him  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2534) he knew this possibility was there and  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2536) he was never surprised  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2537) they invented this theory especially  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2540) to justify that that is especially the  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2543) the  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2544) the financially to justify that how that  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2546) the first son  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2547) was supposed to be the imam after his  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2549) father ismail the son of  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2551) jefferson was excluded and then it went  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2554) to musa  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2557) the imam how come that they went through  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2559) that because the smile turned out to be  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2561) a wine drinker and a fast sinner  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2565) it's not fitting to be an enough and  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2567) they said  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2568) it it appears to allah that this man is  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2570) not fit for it and he removed the imam  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2572) for him no  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2573) even if even if we assume what he say  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2576) legendary theories about imam and so on  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2578) and inheritance or  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2579) being from one iman to another it  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2581) doesn't appear to allah he's not  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2583) surprised this possibility  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2584) that the smile could be a drink and it  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2586) could be a sinner also said musa  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2588) there will be a sinner or not but muslim  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2590) not become a sinner and this is to  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2592) become a sinner  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2593) it does not it's not there's nobody in  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2595) that sense that suddenly something comes  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2597) to allah  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2598) with a state of shock i was not  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2600) expecting that no all of the expectation  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2603) was don't be fooled by some people say  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2605) you mean that allah will be  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2606) we will not know the future allah know  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2608) all contingency of the fish  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2609) all of them without exception and they  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2611) are under complete control of the divine  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2614) power  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2614) and the divine normally things which  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2617) have followed the natural  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2618) natural law by necessity  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2622) they are left to develop as they are but  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2624) allah is have the capability to step in  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2625) and prevent them from  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2629) a few wishes for whatever reason either  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2631) for prophecy  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2632) or whatever or someone made this  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2634) application so allah stepped and changed  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2636) the future  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2637) to in response to the so that's give  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2639) give that  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2640) better a better meaning it is as happy  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2643) to say  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2644) they fight between seven and then this  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2646) is metaphorical go  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2660) way and then it fights and it can even  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2664) stop all qatar  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2665) by permission of allah because allah  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2668) says  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2674) allah raises  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2678) the master control he has the master  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2680) control but he can't raise it  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2682) he can well because the precaution will  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2684) ask him for america and say no they  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2685) don't deserve a remarkable but  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2687) nevertheless  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2688) maybe down the road will show a miracle  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2690) because allah  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2693) raises and refixes because he has the  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2696) master control  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2697) and the home will keep up so from this  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2699) ayah when the  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2700) uml kitab is the master control the  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2702) master knowledge which the knowledge of  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2704) all  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2704) put efficientiality and the control over  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2706) this possibility  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2707) can erase and he can fix so  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2711) the hadith says correct  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2714) nothing will prevent qatar except is  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2716) correct yes there may be a kabbalah or a  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2719) decision made  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2720) but and we have also in early terms and  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2721) interesting story one of the kings i  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2723) didn't remember his name now but i can't  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2724) check when he is  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2726) told by the prophet that get ready to  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2728) die khalas your life is over  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2732) you are going to die in the coming few  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2734) weeks or a month  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2737) so the man for some reason he was  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2740) so so desperate and so so was in pain  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2742) and he seemed to be  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2743) was a good ruler so he went to the holy  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2745) of all hollis  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2746) this is where the sahara the the the  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2749) rock  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2749) the street of the rock is above the rock  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2751) and the rock is there it was inside the  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2753) holy warholes that was in the temple  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2755) that rock it has still cabs and and  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2759) there were certain books and they were  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2761) and also the ark of covenant was there  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2763) the inside of that place and there all  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2764) of that there and it's in a room which  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2766) only the priest was  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2767) permitted the mashem freezed or  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2769) committed only once in a year to enter  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2771) so he went in the holy of all holies  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2774) and throw himself on i think of the ark  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2776) of covenant or in the rock  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2777) and ask allah for to give him more life  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2781) maybe he has some programs to complete  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2782) whatever he was afraid of that we don't  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2784) know  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2785) and he was so sincere and so devoted in  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2787) his prayer that allah revealed to the  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2789) same prophet  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2790) go to him i heard your prayers  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2793) and they had pity with you this is  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2795) obviously metaphorical language allah is  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2796) not happy in that sense  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2798) i recognize that you tell him i'm giving  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2800) him 15 years but no more  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2803) he can complete whatever he wants and  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2805) indeed this one lived 15 years and died  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2807) after that  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2808) so we have these so show you all this is  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2811) the qatar and the things written as as  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2813) they are in the way  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2815) in eternity or at the beginning of time  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2817) this is almost like a misunderstanding  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2818) of the hadith of qatar  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2820) and then what was written was little the  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2822) system of the universe the proportion  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2824) and the  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2824) contingency not that individual events  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2827) otherwise it would be impossible to  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2829) correct because if that's what our knew  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2831) then allah was wrong that's impossible  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2834) no the language is just wrong  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2836) in a way but that one decision can be  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2838) reversed and because he can erase and  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2840) can  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2841) change and can accept dua and change his  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2843) decision  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2844) that's it so  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2850) so that's the question now  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2854) i think we have enough time to begin at  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2856) least yeah we can begin  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2858) how much time we have i think we still  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2860) have until four o'clock we still have  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2862) almo  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2868) now this one is a unique to the quran  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2872) the arab did not know it in that sense  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2875) yeah they know what sputtaki  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2878) no you don't know where means prevention  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2882) and we have the arabic saying  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2898) is a little require is much more  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2901) effective and important than  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2902) a huge amount of medical treatment  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2905) legislation  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2906) essentially vaccination is much better  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2908) than than suffering the disease and  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2910) having  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2910) possibly even to to suffer death and so  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2913) on but  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2914) in prejudices  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2917) so the word is not  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2921) even ramal asked i remember the hadith  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2923) but i don't have the reference  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2925) he was asked what is the quran and  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2928) someone said have you ever been in in  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2931) the in in a valley  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2932) in which uh after rain or so on that the  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2935) trees have broke  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2936) up and grown especially most most  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2939) arabian trees in the valleys and zone  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2941) are very thorny  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2942) and you are going between these three  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2944) three trees  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2946) they are relatively dense but that is  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2947) that you'll never have that denser you  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2949) don't have a walkway you have walkways  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2951) in between  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2951) but sometimes it becomes tight and then  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2954) when it becomes tight  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2955) are you not trying to get your thumb  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2957) your dress close to yourself so it  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2959) doesn't be scratched or  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2961) destroyed by by by the throne say yes  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2964) say this is taqwa you are protecting  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2967) yourself  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2968) by taking action to protection from the  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2970) thorns  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2972) and this is the reason uh the  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2973) translators are quran but  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2975) there are various sites and some there's  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2977) one site which which gives you i think  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2979) six translations  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2980) of the same ayah each one has his own  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2983) style and i might my preference number  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2986) one is pictor  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2987) really and use of ali that's recently  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2990) but  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2990) you can read and and try to get the  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2992) glean whatever meaning there  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2994) they are all having difficulty with the  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2997) pectoral  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=2999) translation those who ward evil prevent  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3002) evil  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3003) that's the closest one to that  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3004) description so pictures seem to be like  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3006) others they said god feeling it's not  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3008) actually good feeling no it's  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3010) part of it's a good feeling but you know  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3012) it is really  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3014) it is really protecting yourself  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3018) from the thorns from what from allah's  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3021) punishment  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3022) by whatever measure is needed that  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3025) requires  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3026) that you are aware about allah's  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3027) existence with allah will  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3029) control and observers of you under the  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3031) thesis all what you do in  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3032) private and public that you are aware  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3034) that allah has revealed injections that  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3036) he will account for injunction because  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3038) he will not account you if he doesn't  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3040) give you an injunction and give you a  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3041) look there's no way it can happen  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3043) and you are sorry aware about our  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3045) existence about her career that he is  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3047) the creator he has created you  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3049) that he is observing and watching you  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3051) that he made  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3052) me i may have made revelation maybe  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3055) maybe we don't know yet but if you come  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3057) to  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3057) know that there's a revelation then it's  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3060) obligating you to comply with the  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3061) revelation otherwise you would be  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3064) uh the question about that and punished  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3066) so protect you from the punishment  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3068) that's the final way  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3069) to protect yourself from your finest so  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3071) the peak of all this development of  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3073) awareness  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3074) is to be aware and certain that they  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3076) will be set in punishment  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3078) and you are doing require you are doing  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3081) prevention  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3083) preventive measures that you don't end  
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3085) with this punishment  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3086) but this makes only sense after you have  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3088) gone through all these awarenesses  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3091) so the best translation would be  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3095) essentially the god away  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3098) because if you have this god awareness  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3100) the correct sense is the full starting  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3101) with the  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3102) existence of god that he is the creator  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3104) not only does existence  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3105) but he is some people believe that there  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3107) is a god who exists but nature also  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3109) exists  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3110) and independent from god or something  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3111) i'd like to they call these those some  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3113) such fixes which are internally  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3115) contradictory we don't want to discuss  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3117) that maybe there will be occasion down  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3118) the road  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3120) then that he's the so creator are aware  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3123) about that you are created by him  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3126) that he he he may have sent messengers  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3131) he has absolute right he's the sovereign  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3133) nobody prevent him  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3134) so the day is clear him always create  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3136) advice but he abdicated  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3138) they their claim is is implausible  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3142) why how do you conclude that how do you  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3144) conclude that  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3145) that all prophecies are wrong what's  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3147) your evidence for that this is just make  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3149) assumption and the reason for that is  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3150) that they don't want to have messenger  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3152) roots so they can't do i think that's  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3153) what they live  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3154) but you will do this the human being  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3156) would like to  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3157) to do mischief as much as you like  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3158) without any responsibility no no no it's  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3160) not like that  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3162) he has the right he is the sovereign he  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3163) is the creator he is the owner he's the  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3165) master  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3166) he has the right to come up if he  
[0:52:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3168) chooses to come and send me say just  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3169) like he said  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3174) if you receive a order from me oh i  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3176) follow my huda  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3177) well it  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3205) so will be prophethood  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3208) you have to scrutinize that and then if  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3211) it's established  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3212) you have the evidence for that like this  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3213) quran itself which is absolutely  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3215) evidence for the prophet muhammad  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3217) then the next step you have to comply  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3219) both with the akhida and belief  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3221) that for them but also in the specific  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3224) injunction the moment they reach to you  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3227) if they don't issue they are not obliged  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3228) but if you treat you a certain  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3230) injunction that you have to comply with  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3231) it  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3233) otherwise if you don't comply you are  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3236) liable for punishment  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3237) as prescribed also in the revelation but  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3239) revelation tell you what kind of  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3240) punishment  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3241) are there and you will be questioned  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3244) will be you will be punished  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3248) so because of this awareness and  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3251) nobody would like to be punished by by  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3253) instinctive nature of human being  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3255) hating pain and suffering and love  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3257) loving happiness and  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3259) no no pain and a nice living you would  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3262) like to have the nice living you have to  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3263) have happiness you would have  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3265) living in in a paradise and in a  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3267) beautiful life in a  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3268) pain-free life then you have to do  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3272) some measures to prevent yourself from  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3274) from from being punished  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3276) by complying with the with the  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3278) commandments my signature commander  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3280) the commandment even if sometimes it's  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3282) difficult it will not be always easy not  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3284) in all situations  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3289) so this awareness and that's it  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3292) ultimately it will end being good  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3294) feeling  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3294) yes but this is only a narrow part of it  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3297) it doesn't give all  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3299) the aspects of warding evil or the  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3301) aspect of being so so i will say  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3303) the best the best translation will be  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3306) for  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3306) is a guidance for the who are good aware  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3309) in the full basis or awareness  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3311) which need to be expanded or at least  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3314) mention the final phase of of of  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3318) awareness which is world evil avoiding  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3320) and protecting themselves from evil  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3328) now who is this if you have this  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3331) awareness as described in full from the  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3334) awareness of his life existence all the  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3336) way to awareness of punishability and  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3338) and the resulting commitment  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3341) to prevent yourself from being punished  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3343) and being suffering pain  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3344) and the unhappiness both  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3360) foreign i think we should not start with  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3363) that  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3363) but one aspect the most  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3366) most fundamental aspect of the mutakin  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3368) is that they do not stop  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3370) at in front of the veil  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3373) because in the around the universe the  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3375) visible things that  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3377) they are not raped they are present we  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3379) see them we believe in them that  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3381) we we see them we attract with them we  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3383) have we  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3384) recognize the existence by necessity but  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3386) what is behind that behind the wheel  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3388) that's the rape that's the meaning of  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3390) rape  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3391) that has to be believed in  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3394) and the way we know we have to also  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3396) discuss what the meaning of iman is iman  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3398) only is not just believing  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3400) assassinating iman by belief is not it's  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3402) not a good answer  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3403) is have faith more than just belief it  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3406) is  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3407) it is having trust and having  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3410) a decision a a decision or free will  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3414) to comply with things related to that  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3416) trust and to that belief  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3417) and i think we leave that uh the nation  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3420) of iman and the difference between him  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3421) and his son  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3424) holding something to be true which can  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3426) be referenced as  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3427) believing i believe that's that's true  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3429) that's happening  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3431) it's not like having faith in that's  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3432) happening or having iman in this  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3435) happening that's different  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3436) but people mix it and they confuse iman  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3438) would just be  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3439) just holding something to be true it's  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3441) not it's not the iman  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3442) which allah required god requires from  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3446) the believer  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3447) under the moment and attributed him this  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3450) this  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3450) noble title of iman it is more than that  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3453) and i think we  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3454) will get to that inshallah next time  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3456) because it needs a little bit more of  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3458) expansion  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3459) we'll do it inshaallah in the next  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3460) halaca  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3470) i have a question that came in yeah it  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3472) is uh  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3473) the man who killed a hundred people and  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3474) he was told to go and live with someone  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3476) uh some people and in between those two  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3478) regions he died  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3479) uh allah asked the angels to measure the  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3480) distance to see which area the man is  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3482) closer to before determining if he's a  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3483) person that belongs to hellfire or  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3485) paradise  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3486) in this case allah azzawajal making an  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3488) excuse for the believer  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3489) it's not that uh allah is unaware or  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3492) unsure if this man should go to heaven  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3493) or hell  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3494) is this a good example of qadhar yeah  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3497) this is a good example what's what  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3498) this this man or if she was a criminal  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3501) and he was killing  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3502) rifle and center and then the full story  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3504) is is good to god the full story of the  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3506) story that  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3506) he asked but he feels regret and that  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3508) he's sinful and he want to change his  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3510) life  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3510) so he asked who is the most  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3512) knowledgeable in earth so the people by  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3514) mistake for uh  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3515) guided him towards a resume to arrive to  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3517) a monk  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3518) a habit a man who worship of  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3522) rituals and so on seclusion in some way  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3524) being secluded in a monastery does not  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3527) mean that you are  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3527) knowledgeable he asked about the most  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3530) knowledgeable unethical this question is  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3531) knowledge  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3532) and they got it in the wrong place so  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3533) they went to the raheb whether i was  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3535) ignorant  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3536) maybe a good man indulged in so many  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3538) rituals and fasting  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3540) i may be eating only a piece of bread  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3542) every 40 days like some  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3544) monks do all of that it doesn't make you  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3546) adam  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3547) and ask him say say you killed 99 and  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3550) you won't  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3551) you want to repent there's no repentance  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3553) for you so he killed him completed  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3554) hundred  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3557) that he went to his own way and then his  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3560) conscience still  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3561) bothered him and then he asked about  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3564) uh about the most knowledge of man on  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3568) earth  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3568) now this time the people guided him to  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3570) the knowledgeable  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3585) he said what who told you that who  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3587) prevent you from repenting  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3588) but repentance needs commitment  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3592) i need the right environment you're you  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3595) are in a prayer in a place or in  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3596) a village or a city of evil people the  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3599) environment does not encourage you to  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3601) repent  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3602) you have to leave that place  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3605) get away maybe he'll be living maybe  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3607) like in mexico there's a certain area  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3609) where the drug  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3610) lord and so on have complete control the  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3612) government's almost excluded  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3613) i'm just giving an example not meaning  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3615) that the drug lord like drug laws are  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3617) western  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3618) the mexican government maybe they are  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3619) better than we don't know  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3622) if i think american imperialism is their  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3623) own way they have twisted way but that's  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3625) all that they can anyway  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3627) but if you are living with them you  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3628) cannot stop killing and cutting people  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3630) in pieces and so on  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3632) like like we have seen so many videos on  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3634) these horrifying things  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3635) and oppressing people and forcing people  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3637) but you can't  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3639) you have to get out of this environment  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3640) you need to have a good enough you have  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3641) a good combination  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3643) in that other place maybe an area like  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3646) for example near the  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3647) dead sea area for example because the  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3649) response from malaysia  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3651) seems to be in that area there are  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3653) people who are devoted to ibadah through  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3655) this world  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3656) maybe in monastery and so on then you  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3658) will be in a environment clean  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3660) and encouraging you and with you getting  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3662) your your  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3664) uh you uh out of this  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3667) evil involvement is to the importance of  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3669) the environment  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3670) and changing the environment sometimes  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3672) you have to unstopping the relation with  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3674) with bad people bad companies is bad  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3676) company  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3677) not everyone will be able to get  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3679) yourself out of the bad company  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3681) except for physical separation sometimes  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3683) you will not have the peer pressure  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3685) sometimes enormous  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3687) so he decided that yeah he wanted daily  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3689) a little bit and so he took the advice  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3690) and went on the way  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3692) now on almost on midway he he died he  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3696) died  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3698) that reached him heart attack whatever  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3700) it is  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3701) and then the angels of mercy  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3704) and the angels of punishment were  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3707) disputing  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3708) the edge of punishment said listen this  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3711) man did never anything good  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3712) that he was intending well that does not  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3716) negate what he has done in time past and  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3718) the angel's voice he said no no no  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3720) he came with his heart towards allah and  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3722) he intended to repent  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3723) and he was going to change his life so  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3726) he started the repentance he repented  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3727) so that must have it is that and they  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3730) were disputing obviously it took somehow  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3732) allah allowed him to take him on form so  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3734) allah sent an angel  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3736) in a human form that also has some deep  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3739) sense  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3740) a man okay so the angel disapp appeared  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3743) to him  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3743) and when he said at least everything's  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3744) happened you'll find first of all  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3746) uh various stories of angels coming in  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3748) human shape and  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3749) come back accommodate some some people  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3751) like in the story he was the name of the  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3753) young boy would i remember that shall i  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3755) get to you next time  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3756) who has a companion angel for some long  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3758) time and so on so that was in that time  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3760) that it was  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3760) present divided divine presence in form  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3764) of angels and was there and amazingly  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3768) the angels ask the human  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3772) we have this this this dispute  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3776) what to do it's very simple measure  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3780) the distance physical distance  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3783) it's a simple-minded approach but it's  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3784) by allah to this angel  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3786) in human shape to whoever city his  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3789) close-up  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3790) location he is closer then he belongs to  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3793) that if he's still close to his original  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3795) evil place then take him those who  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3797) punish with his still  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3798) and this is just symbolism  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3801) that's a symbolism  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3805) now it happened that otherwise actually  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3808) physically  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3809) he was closer to the evil city  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3812) by just a chest with  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3815) so he needs just to tell if he attend he  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3818) would be  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3819) so allah ordered that city to go away  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3823) the evil one and the good city to come  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3825) close so the measure will fit  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3827) or if you would like to say you can say  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3829) it otherwise allah ordered their sticks  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3831) to shrink and expand  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3835) it can be this way this way we know the  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3836) theory of reactivity it can be the  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3838) sticks could change  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3839) could shrink or the real distances could  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3841) change  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3842) for a human observer you cannot make any  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3845) difference because because you have to  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3846) measure distances by stick and if the  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3849) stick  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3849) shrinks and expand then distances will  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3852) will appear as if they are externally  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3853) likely they're not real just your major  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3855) as as for those who love their theory  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3858) maybe there's a way to look at  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3860) it it's just a human measure of the  
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3862) distance this sense itself and the space  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3863) is absolute  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3864) but the way we measure it is not  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3865) absolutely no i'm not going to go  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3867) indulging that leave it for for  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3869) intriguing for other muscles who loves  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3871) relativity theory so and then the angels  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3875) of mercy took him  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3877) so there had been a decision  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3881) and went that way although i knew that  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3883) he would die  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3884) as opposed to he died away and knew the  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3887) moment he died that they would be  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3888) disputed with the angels all of that's  
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3889) not  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3890) all and he decided to show for human  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3892) beings  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3893) and for the angels and for for the  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3895) posterity because this story maybe have  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3897) not witnessed by anybody except by this  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3900) angel in human shape and these angels  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3902) but allah fixed it through knowing that  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3905) one day a prophet in the future will  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3906) come and he will tell that story  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3908) as an example of allah's mercy  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3912) all of that is under allah control he  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3915) made it to happen so like  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3916) like like a like a display or a drama  
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3921) displaying a certain a certain fact  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3924) which may be for the president there was  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3925) nobody present only angels  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3928) maybe israel will never know that story  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3930) if you check there's no story like that  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3932) doesn't matter it was made for later  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3936) for someone else to do later  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3939) you see what i mean so it is both  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3941) showing that the show of qatar and  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3942) showing the allah controller  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3944) and that allah sometimes express things  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3946) as  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3947) events sometimes with human like like  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3950) this here are displaying  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3951) a metaphorical drama real you see it  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3954) reality in front of you but it is not  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3956) real in the sense  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3957) that it is never intended to happen like  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3959) that  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3960) but to give an example and to like a  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3963) dramatic  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3964) er whatever dramatic exposition or a  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3967) session of certain things in a dramatic  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3969) way in this case  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3971) they will know what this is around most  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3972) likely maybe there were people who don't  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3974) know that the story does not see  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3976) that people are standing there on the  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3977) interior of the spirit in the present  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3978) team  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3979) there's no narration in the abuse book  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3981) and  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3982) and the other issue came in a human  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3983) shape to show the superiority of humans  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3985) over angels in matter of such judgments  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3988) which may give a good indication for the  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3990) theory that the ancients are really  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3992) something like natural forces not really  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3994) fully intellectually  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3996) uh free agent as as we sometimes you may  
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=3999) envisage maybe we don't know  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4000) we'll come also what the national ranges  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4002) will come down the road and the various  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4003) points of view from the south by the way  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4005) and from other philosophical schools  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4007) about that  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4009) so this is is more related to the  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4012) allah's control of the universe and how  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4014) he does in the future so  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4016) although the man died closer to the evil  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4017) city physique  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4019) objectively whatever the word  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4021) objectively means  
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4023) in in the knowledge of allah allah  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4025) ordered the images to different or the  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4027) distances to shrink and expand  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4029) so that he would be in compliance with  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4031) the with the ruling of that  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4034) angel taking a human shape that to be  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4037) closer to the merciful  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4038) which that it's more to show that  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4040) allah's mercy  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4042) how comprehensive is another example for  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4045) example  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4045) for allah breaks  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4049) borders which we are used to normally is  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4051) that the prostitute  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4053) so which was thirsty and she went down a  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4055) wheel  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4056) uh well and they drank and then when she  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4058) came up from the dog was unable to  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4061) eating from from there from the sand  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4063) which has a bit of wetness trying to get  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4065) some water all this four dog is so  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4068) thirsty like myself  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4069) and she felt so pitiful and imaginary  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4072) and down  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4073) and to get water up what to do she took  
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4076) her  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4077) hoof for a little socks made out of  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4080) leather  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4080) filled it held the region her teeth and  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4083) climbed up and gave that to the dog  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4085) i was so thankful for that action that  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4088) action of mercy  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4089) that he forgive her and enter the  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4091) paradise he died after that  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4092) with an accident in the dead that was  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4094) enough to it is all sins  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4097) so it shows that allah's message is so  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4100) is more showing the the enormity of  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4103) allah's messi  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4104) another example for example the story i  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4106) don't know how very authentic it is  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4108) but we'll check it and we get that that  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4110) that jabril was present when  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4112) ron was drowning and then he said  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4116) said when he was drowning he was saying  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4121) real claims to the prophet that's the  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4122) narration say i was filling his  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4124) mouth with mud so that he afraid that he  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4128) may pronounce something which that  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4129) divine mercy may catch  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4130) still  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4136) this man was not really worthy of mercy  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4140) he has so many crimes under and that's  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4142) what he said there's just  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4143) hoping that maybe he could hold musa or  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4145) something allah and we don't know  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4147) if the story is correct so gibrilis is  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4149) in the tough side  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4150) mikhail is is reportedly in on the soft  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4153) side but that's it  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4154) all of these nice things which has  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4156) certain metaphorical and spiritual  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4158) aspects which  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4160) the best is kept in that so it will  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4162) boost the spirit of the people  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4164) and their hope in the divine mercy  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4166) rather than going into  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4168) very deep theological philosophical  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4170) respect which we can go also  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4171) but but this is more in in in the  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4174) direction of the divine mercy rather  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4177) than  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4177) mother of cuddle  
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4186) mother is settled  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4189) and stories and also later down we seen  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4192) the quranic evidences which is  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4194) refused this story that the things are  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4197) known and fixed as they are  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4200) in eternity or at the beginning of time  
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4202) or even once a year or something like  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4204) that that's not  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4206) there are decisions made there and  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4208) decision made later decision made up  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4210) and decision made that and maybe there  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4212) is a qatar but  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4213) even all these decisions relate to  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4216) future  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4217) contingency and even these decisions can  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4220) be reviewed and  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4221) overcome by allah again  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4224) motivated by a dua and allah knew we  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4227) made the decision that maybe someone  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4229) will make a dua  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4230) out of his free will and then allah  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4233) decided  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4233) if there comes i'm going to review my  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4236) decision  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4237) yeah or i can review my decision  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4242) at that time and there are evidences in  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4245) the quran i think the strongest evidence  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4246) i once told it to shazad is that  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4248) the i want to say about the three who  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4251) have been  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4255) the three have been postponed or other  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4257) people have been postponed when  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4258) after uh coming back from the book  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4261) uh people some people were granted  
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4264) permission  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4265) for forgiven at face although they were  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4268) monaphitine  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4269) and others were postponed so  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4292) either one and it's clearly the decision  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4294) of allah and this allah is talking about  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4296) himself about his decision so it cannot  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4297) be that as  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4298) from human point of view they said they  
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4300) are possible that allah knows what's  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4301) happening no  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4302) because allah says clearly they are  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4304) delayed to the decision or allah  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4306) and the decision will be either to  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4307) punish them or forgive them  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4310) but the decision was not made yet  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4312) otherwise the  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4314) the claims were postponed to the  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4315) decision will be will be a falsehood  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4317) allah  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4318) will never lie kind of reform but i  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4320) think one of the strongest evidences for  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4322) our theory  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4323) of the open future open in the sense i  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4325) explained  
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4326) all continue to say hello to allah and  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4328) all of them under divine control and  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4331) power and he can decide whatever he  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4334) wants and even the decision can be  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4336) reviewed unless  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4337) there is an absolute barring for the  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4338) review for example if he  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4341) gives one of his prophets a prophecy  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4343) then  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4344) he is obliged on allah that the prophecy  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4345) will be fulfilled otherwise the prophet  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4347) will be  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4347) a prophet will be refused or will be  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4350) rejected and will be undermined so that  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4352) must  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4352) or he gives a promise to someone to give  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4355) him some benefit  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4356) that allah is obliged to fulfill his  
[1:12:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4357) voice he will never fail his problem  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4360) not for the threat because the threat of  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4362) punishment allah can't forgot he can't  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4363) fully decide  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4364) i will not execute my threat there's no  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4367) obligation allah to complete his threats  
[1:12:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4370) but it does not undermine the divine  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4372) perfection or the divine honor  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4375) but failing to deliver on a promise  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4377) undermine the divine honor  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4379) and allah that promise he will never  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4382) break  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4384) therefore and the promise of of of  
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4387) reward for the believer  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4388) is certain to come when maybe it's not  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4391) decided it wants to come maybe it can  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4393) shift back and forth we don't know  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4396) maybe it's there are various  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4398) possibilities all of them are still open  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4400) to allah to decide  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4402) but this must come by necessity and  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4405) tomorrow  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4406) one one year down the road 10 years down  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4408) the road one million year old  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4410) billionaire trillion it has to come  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4413) because allah promised that there will  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4414) be a resurrection and people will be  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4416) will be rewarded  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4418) other people who have punished but this  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4419) is a threat he is at liberty to  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4421) execute or not execute but this is will  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4424) come when we come to the  
[1:13:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4425) jahannam this is finite or not finite  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4427) and so on these issues are also  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4428) intriguing  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4429) and led to some controversy  
[1:13:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4433) yeah so that's that's it so that that  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4435) hadith is more  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4437) into matter of how extensive and wide  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4440) the divine mercy  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4442) it is much more than anyone can imagine  
[1:14:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4445) it is similar in the hadith  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4449) create the universe he made he created  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4451) hundred mercies  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4453) he kept 99 with him above the throne  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4455) that's all metaphorical  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4457) and broadcasted one in the whole  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4460) universe  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4461) from that one of the one percent  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4464) the mother she lifts her thoughts which  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4466) doesn't harm her baby  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4468) that that kindness is an expression  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4472) of the divine one percent of the divine  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4473) mercy so don't think that is  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4476) yeah you could say that's my evolution  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4477) because those careless mothers  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4480) get extinct and they don't have no  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4482) babies under that yeah that's all  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4483) correct that's the mechanism how it  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4485) works  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4485) apparently but the deep system  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4489) uh did which broadcast in the system is  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4491) the divine mercy  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4493) so all that you see in the universe  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4495) which looks good and then is from the  
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4496) divine mercy which militates through  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4498) space and time and to cause an effect  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4502) but you have to see it you have to be  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4503) spiritual you have to be allah aware  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4505) if you are atheist you don't see it you  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4507) say oh this is actually by evolution  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4508) but mothers will will have not enough  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4510) babies and they will get extinct that  
[1:15:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4511) line will get reserved that's true  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4513) true but this is the apparent one this  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4515) is this side  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4516) what's the sign behind the veil that's  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4518) the other side  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4520) that is the divine mercy which will  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4524) broadcast in the universe it's spread  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4526) the same with  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4527) when the quran says about that the  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4529) heavens and the earth and mountains and  
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4532) they praise allah they make this be but  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4535) you don't understand the testimony  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4537) someone could say maybe the electron  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4539) rotating around the  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4540) the nucleus is some kind of just be  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4542) praising allah yes it could be  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4544) but they don't see it as a spiritually  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4545) spiritual it's fixed by allah so to  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4547) appraisal to show us allah power  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4549) and how the reverse have been fixed to  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4551) produce this exact  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4553) situation we have with this provided  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4554) initial conditions  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4556) and tuned finally so that we are here  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4557) today discussing these matters  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4559) if it has been tuned differently we  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4561) would not be here some barren universe  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4563) could have a result and this is well  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4564) calculated  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4566) physicists know that so by this choice  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4569) is the divine mercy  
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4570) expectation of the divine message to get  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4574) to in this situation which we have now  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4578) the way he shows it okay so this is more  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4581) more in the divine messy rather than the  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4582) qatar side but it's it's it's very very  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4585) illuminating and very spiritually  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4586) uplifting  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4587) any other question  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4590) uh sheikh abe has uh requested abdulbasa  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4593) is requested  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4594) to ask a couple questions so go ahead  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4596) please bro  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4604) a b yeah go ahead yeah okay can you hear  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4608) me  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4609) yeah yeah okay so the question i was  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4612) asking about  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4613) you mentioned uh quickly  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4616) uh sorry and  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4619) uh  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4626) it is very wide thread regarded as the  
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4628) preferred by most people  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4630) for some reason i never felt very  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4632) friendly with it somehow  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4634) sure um a microphone yeah sure  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4637) my my specific question is on the on on  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4640) the sub category of  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4641) quran how familiar are you with ibn  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4644) arabi versus jason both of them  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4646) approach specifically but  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4650) um from a different way so ibn arabi is  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4652) a  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4653) sort of medieval maliki whereas the  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4654) source is a an early hanafi  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4657) it's a bit earlier than in arabia i  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4659) think  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4660) which time just died roughly 400  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4662) something  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4674) yeah and they have confrontation and  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4676) hazard for  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4679) yeah so they are almost contemporary uh  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4682) no i would say uh  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4683) uh i i honestly say there is no  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4686) comparison alias is much more superior  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4688) much more rational  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4690) much more respectable i mean arabi is is  
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4692) biased and  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4694) the confrontation he had with the uh  
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4697) it has whatever we agree or disagree  
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4699) about the fine point details and so on  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4701) shows that he is not really uh  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4704) i would hate to say that my feeling that  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4707) he's not a honest scholar  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4709) he's very partisan he's very  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4711) pro-government  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4712) uh uh is a government scholar of his  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4716) time  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4716) or even husband was very critical to the  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4718) government and very critical to  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4720) those who locate our life who destroyed  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4723) andalus and delivered the two to the  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4724) christian in the long run  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4726) okay um so that's fine on that one um  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4729) okay a final question i  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4730) had was about to see a modern  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4745) i think it's one of the best i did not  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4746) mention it because it's more  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4748) recent it's definitely one of the best  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4751) uh it's  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4754) excellent in the sense in every sense  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4757) the only thing is that because he  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4759) he has to take care of the some  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4761) sensitivities of the wahabi and  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4762) sensitivities of the  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4764) far far west maliki because his royal  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4766) refuge  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4767) and so on he was a little bit hesitant  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4771) to express himself sometimes  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4773) directly and forcefully in certain areas  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4776) which you could have done better  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4778) but this is one of the lessons this is  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4780) the uh  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4781) that's an excellent uh an excellent book  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4784) definitely i would say just just to  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4788) finish this off  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4789) no for me it gave me heart in the sense  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4792) that seeing that there's an original  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4793) contribution that's made  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4795) in the 15th well late 14th century 15th  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4797) century history it's  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4798) still possible the evidence is done  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4800) there  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4802) but the thing i was going to say this  
[1:20:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4803) they say there's a better one by  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4806) sorry  
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4812) sorry um so but because he was in a  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4814) relatively isolated place  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4831) llama there so before the partition  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4832) obviously there were many muslims there  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4835) so there was um apparently they say his  
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4838) one is better but obviously because of  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4839) his location  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4840) and at the time you know when the shift  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4842) was happening and there's a lot of  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4843) muslims moving over the border it got  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4845) lost in the sounds of times but  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4846) it there is a published edition  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4850) if if if you find a pdf or something  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4852) send it by email yeah  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4853) you want it to me finally um someone  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4856) asked the question i actually wanted to  
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4858) ask the end  
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4858) sorry brothers i know it's long so i'll  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4860) keep it short about zamakshari and kash  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4863) kashaf and they talk also about say  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4867) is it or is it is it correct  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4870) or do we call it it's it's what uh is  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4873) one way he said  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4874) he did not call it under the shadow of  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4877) the quran the shade of the quran so like  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4878) like sitting like a quran like a tree  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4880) and you're sitting on the tree and  
[1:21:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4881) having the coldness or the tree  
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4883) so it's more like like the spiritual  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4885) aspects and some other philosophical and  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4887) political aspects etc  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4888) but i would say it is it is it is uh he  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4892) did not indulge in  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4893) some areas in very fine points of turkey  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4895) but i would say i would say it is also  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4898) is good the problem is that he he went  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4901) uh  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4902) he went into uh into a tesla uh  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4905) tradition  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4906) a little bit excessively and was  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4908) advocating the tesla point of view  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4910) or which has uh uh which overshadowed  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4913) which whichever  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4917) but everyone will have a point of view  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4919) and he will put into the quran but  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4921) in in any case uh bible said to the  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4924) benefit of quran is the only one who  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4926) addressed the ayah related as i  
[1:22:07](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4927) mentioned about about qadhafi  
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4931) he's the only one who should commit to  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4933) that ayah because everyone say there  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4935) were three people who were were not  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4936) punished and so on they will be punished  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4938) later or forgiven and they were given  
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4939) etc  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4940) and they don't mention even the  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4941) implication of the ayah only he said  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4943) this is only in a human point of view  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4945) but actually allah knew what has got to  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4947) happen so he wanted to save the point of  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4948) view of the  
[1:22:29](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4949) so-called divine prayer knowledge but  
[1:22:31](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4951) the only one who committed noticed  
[1:22:33](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4953) the problem with that and try escape and  
[1:22:35](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4955) say this is from a point of view over  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4956) humans  
[1:22:37](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4957) but allah is different because obviously  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4959) manifestly is wrong  
[1:22:41](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4961) because allah spoke about himself and  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4962) about his decision  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4965) in in in a clear arabic which has no  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4968) harmony delayed to the decision of allah  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4971) either he will punish them or forgive  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4974) them  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4976) it could be allah would be that would be  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4978) if the decision was  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4979) already made or before  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=4982) and he knew that that he  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=5020) maybe not monday tomorrow maybe next  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=5022) monday or friday if you have articulated  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=5024) the  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/jiYUtS8a5hU?t=5025) question and things insha'allah for
