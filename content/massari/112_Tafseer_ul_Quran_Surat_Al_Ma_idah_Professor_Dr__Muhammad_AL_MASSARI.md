[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=376) interpretation it is the meaning of that  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=379) it is the the those who got astray from  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=382) the kofar they will not harm you their  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=384) costume not harm you that's it not that  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=386) it doesn't apply to any believer and  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=388) also if you look at the wedding of the  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=390) Ayah you see how how people come  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=392) sometimes  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=394) misunderstood so this is it doesn't have  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=397) you all got to go astray when you are  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=399) guided that's not who commits sin and  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=401) you are not crazy and you are not doing  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=404) it no this is  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=406) and usually when going astray or a  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=409) guidance is  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=410) not about believer doing mistakes which  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=414) others should command and enjoying them  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=416) to change and Etc so this is the only  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=418) collection there's still understanding  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=420) so this is it will not harm you with a  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=422) disbeliever that I believe I want to  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=424) stay if they are guided and you fall to  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=426) the right path so don't worry about that  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=429) focus on that it does not mean for  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=431) example even for this video but that you  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=432) don't call them to Islam that doesn't  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=434) debate with them in good times to get  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=436) them back from some of the misguidance  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=438) no it doesn't mean that but that you  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=441) should not be concerned about that in  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=443) the sense that you grieve or think you  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=444) are responsible no they are responsive  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=446) of their own acts and so on but you are  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=448) still have the enjoyment of calling them  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=450) to Islam to God to wear that give them  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=453) good admonishment and good advice etc  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=456) etc  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=457) so that's I think that we did not touch  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=459) this last time so so I want to just  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=461) assess that point that is does not have  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=463) anything to do with the command good and  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=465) forbidden evil or or does not have any  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=468) uh any restricting meaning to the Surah  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=470) that all humans are lost except for  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=473) enjoying  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=477) and enjoy it to each other or admonish  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=480) each other for hack and for Sabbath is  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=484) right and to be persistent and  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=487) perseverance in sticking to the truth  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=490) because usually sticking the truth is  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=492) usually painful and Peter  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=495) this this is different than this one  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=497) here it is those who go astray by their  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=500) own will willful doing will not harm you  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=503) but if you fail to to do your detail of  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=507) calling to Islam and so on when it is  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=509) possible or for the entire inside the  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=510) believer we have the obligation of  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=512) commanding good at video  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=514) forbidding evil which is in the  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=516) injunction of the Quran Sunnah in many  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=518) places then that will harm you because  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=520) you've helped your duty so nobody should  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=522) misunderstand that like this so as a  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=524) companion  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=526) in Islam maybe he did not have the depth  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=529) of knowledge and education but still  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=531) although this is only interesting to see  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=533) that so even companion could fall in  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=535) such a misinterpretation because they  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=539) have not really absorbed the meaning or  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=540) did not get enough education over the  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=542) prophet because they are late in  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=543) companionship but even all this  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=545) companion could make mistakes as some  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=548) people sometimes have said the  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=549) companions say that they think it's a  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=550) lecture the moment someone become a  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=552) companion somehow you grow wings and  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=554) become like an angel this misconception  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=556) we almost clean from our head and it  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=558) will come down in Shabba and in the next  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=560) Ayah so that's the meaning of this area  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=561) that's the comet otherwise it's clear so  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=565) don't be uh don't think that that you  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=568) will be harmed by those going in  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=569) Michigan going to miscarriage by the old  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=571) design we are not harmful for you as  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=573) long as your own Duty and you are  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=576) getting back guided part of being guided  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=578) is that you carry the dawa when it is  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=580) appropriate obvious  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=581) is not an obligation  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=584) except for those who who have sufficient  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=587) knowledge and have in certain position  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=589) of dawah but cutting down the other  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=591) remote  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=593) inside the Muslim Community is an  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=596) obligation especially against the rulers  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=598) and with the rules that's fundamentalist  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=600) part of the description of the Believers  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=602) which we I think came to Surah when you  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=604) said the main characteristic of the  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=606) Believers as a community both male and  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=608) female that they come out good and very  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=610) evil and believe in Allah has messenger  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=612) and performs Allah Etc they say the  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=614) commander good they are alive they  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=617) support each other they come out good  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=619) and forbid even even  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=621) a head even believing in Allah we know  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=623) we realize the base but this is for such  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=625) importance in that context that it's  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=627) mentioned even ahead also more important  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=630) eyes  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=631) so that's the that's what this ISO do  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=634) not be I think that these who are one  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=637) that's three will harm you as long as  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=639) you are guided or part of being guided  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=641) is to do your duties whatever it is and  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=645) do as much as possible from these  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=647) reality things if you're capable and if  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=649) you you have a facility for that like  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=651) for example if you are a qualified man  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=653) who for example has a long arm and long  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=656) information about for example the  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=659) various we will come to that it is maybe  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=661) today or next time what the various  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=664) publication and mistakes in the  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=665) scripture description to inform that  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=667) people have that and call them to  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=668) islamans  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=669) correction for those mistakes in the  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=672) description and so on but that's  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=674) obviously what becomes an obligation for  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=675) if there is nobody else doing it and  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=677) secondly if you are really well  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=678) established in that but otherwise you  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=680) don't follow up with this believer of  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=682) going with the misguidance and uh but  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=686) inside the Islamic Camp there you have  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=687) no Liberty references of this evidence  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=690) especially from the rulers you have to  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=692) change it if if necessary if it is the  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=695) level of coverage by false if not  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=698) capable then by word if not capable then  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=700) at least in the heart you have to  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=702) condemn it and reject it and train  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=704) yourself to  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=706) by word or by the sword if necessary  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=709) so that nobody should confuse that this  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=711) is a liberty or exclusion from  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=714) commanding God of everything inside the  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=715) Muslim Community  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=717) so and concluding all of you will be  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=720) sent to Allah and he will inform  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=722) everyone what he's doing so get focused  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=723) on yourself that you're even guided  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=725) because you will be questioned about all  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=727) your Deeds so they don't don't divert  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=730) your attention well for that which is  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=732) not your job do your job and your job is  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=734) to be guided  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=747) corrupt or they deviate they are capable  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=749) usually to be corrupt and male and  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=753) destroy the whole society much faster  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=755) than any single person but that is  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=757) another another issue which we call it  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=760) Indulgence and put detail we have a  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=762) complete book about that inshallah will  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=764) have second edition coming soon and also  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=767) translated the first edition is  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=768) available in Arabic second edition is  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=771) being published now and developed and it  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=773) will be inshallah that would be the  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=775) initial translated that will take away a  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=777) few weeks every few months to finish  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=781) so then we continue with the more  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=783) complex Ayah which is we just thread and  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=785) realization just repeated session again  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=787) then the next one uh a look at the pixel  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=790) translation see if pectal has some  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=791) nuances there different than the others  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=796) [Music]  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=804) is

[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=818) century or something to get pixels  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=821) they should have there's a Modern  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=823) English version of it I don't know why  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=825) it is  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=830) I said it does not have the English test  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=833) he's not an genuine English the best of  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=835) English test is that polypical  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=837) well this is yeah from 1500s  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=841) this is this is a oh ye who believe this  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=844) is just the best one is Kafka so they  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=848) cut through the unnecessary uh so this  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=851) one's good I mean Believers When Death  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=853) approaches you let two just men from  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=855) among you act as witnesses to the  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=857) writing of your will if death approaches  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=859) you while you are traveling far from  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=860) home let two just men from among other  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=863) from among another people act as  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=865) Witnesses take hold of the two men after  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=868) having prayed and if you have any doubts  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=870) in your mind let each of them pray to  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=872) God we will not sell our word for any  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=875) price even if it were for the sake of a  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=877) mere relative we will not hide God's  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=879) testimony or else we will be counted  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=882) among the sinful okay so the first  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=884) collection is that they said two just  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=886) men no it is  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=889) honesty and truthfulness these two it is  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=894) used also for the feminine and general  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=896) injunctions so so it could be men and  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=899) women so that's that's bad but this one  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=900) is stuck in his mentality that woman  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=902) cannot be Witnesses or on his restricted  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=906) way which is his fallacy and you  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=907) remember we discussed at the end of this  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=910) fallacy is still stuck in many brains  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=912) that's number one so are the two of  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=915) Justice  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=916) what are these two female female uh male  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=919) female uh whatever neutral if they  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=921) success doesn't exist obviously despite  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=924) all these LGBT Etc nonsense but if it is  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=927) done that was that they just and they  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=930) are people of justice and honesty and  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=932) the Integrity so that their witnesses  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=934) can be uh can be relied upon principle  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=938) from you what does he say from you some  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=942) translate from your own people without  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=944) meaning God's Own people they are trying  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=946) to run away because there were two point  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=947) of view since ancient time what is from  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=949) you meaning the correct point of view  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=951) establish stressed and brought to so  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=953) many narratives from webinar Bus and  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=955) many other companions majority not all  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=958) but the majority of Companions and is it  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=961) from your meaning from the believing was  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=962) from the from the belief of the Muslims  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=965) and or two others from from the others  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=968) too  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=970) to just people also which you perceive  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=973) to be just again it doesn't say just  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=975) want to say two others from that from  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=978) from outside not from you and the  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=980) correct point of view it is from  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=982) non-believers people outside Islam and  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=984) you'll find many others saying from the  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=986) people of the book but this is  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=987) restricting something which Allah did  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=989) not restricted Allah could have said  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=991) from the word no that's not that's  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=993) putting in Allah's mouth what he did not  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=995) say that's wrong it's from any outside  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=998) the correct point of view from those  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=999) from you  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1001) do just one could be men could be a man  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1004) and woman Etc in in control distinction  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1007) and rejection of the misconception which  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1010) has been digging itself deep in Islamic  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1012) history an Islamic scholarship and from  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1015) the others will be outside the Muslim  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1017) faith from other faith and other beliefs  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1022) and this is specifically the but it is  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1025) not a condition  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1026) s  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1030) are going back and forth on Earth  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1032) meaning you are not at home  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1034) that's how it usually happens but  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1037) there's not been this is necessary  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1038) condition for this for this situation  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1042) some people say this is a condition that  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1044) if you have uh from from the other Faith  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1047) only is it it's as conditional on that  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1050) but definitely this is not persuasive  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1053) that's it it is being being on on travel  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1057) and so on the story which is the  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1058) revision came to is about travel I will  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1061) mention the story soon but that that  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1063) should be not regarded as persuasive and  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1066) comparing but this is normally where it  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1069) happens because you're in your home  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1071) unsettled and then and you feel that  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1073) approaching then there will be relatives  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1075) nearby there'll be there but there'll be  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1077) enough Witnesses and relatives and even  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1079) lawyers and so on available to do that  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1081) there is no need to go into this complex  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1083) regulation so this will be mostly and  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1086) almost exclusively happening only if you  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1088) are not at home you are going to travel  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1090) and we mentioned that when we mention  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1091) the story become clear what means and  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1094) then you are suddenly feeling this  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1096) approach getting falling sick getting an  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1099) infection getting a deadly injury and  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1101) then we have you have to manage that  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1105) and these these two  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1108) have to be uh forced to stand after  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1111) prayer  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1112) so that they make an oath by Allah  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1115) but only inner septum if you have a  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1118) doubt about their witness if there's no  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1120) doubt there's no reason for that then  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1122) only today that you receive the  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1124) testimony  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1127) what they have they're delivering I will  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1129) mention exactly what that was exactly I  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1131) mean we're delivering and then  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1132) everything looks correct there's nothing  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1135) which missing there whichever any  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1136) hinting does it then there is no need to  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1138) get them to make an oath after the  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1141) prayer whose prayer of also we'll get to  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1142) that also that because you have doubt  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1146) and they make an oath that we make about  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1148) Allah that we are not going uh for for  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1151) any motivation even if it's beneficial  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1153) for one of our next option and we are  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1156) not going to hide anything for the  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1157) witness of Allah  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1160) otherwise we are definitely sinful and  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1163) unjust  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1166) so  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1169) it seems to be that mentioning  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1173) looks like  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1175) how to apply that for people who are not  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1178) a Believer but that is because because  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1180) the the people do not follow the the the  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1183) the straight in the Stream of the of the  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1186) evidence of the ayas because it says you  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1189) could say it is it has two two different  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1191) statements that have merged together  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1193) with an or in between  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1195) if you ask them on traveling away and so  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1198) on and then this surprises you  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1201) then get to Witnesses of of Justice from  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1205) you from the believer  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1208) but if when they come to deliver the the  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1211) the Wasilla the will or the what they  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1213) what the dying person has with him to  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1215) commence money Etc the story will  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1218) clarify with what we may have and they  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1220) deliver it and everything seems to be in  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1222) order there's no need to doubt anything  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1224) there's no need for them let usually  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1225) them to stand get them to the court and  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1228) ask him to after Salah that's for the  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1230) believer obviously as we're talking  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1232) about Muslim and then uh they make an  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1235) author a very heavily author like that  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1237) without also the heaviness of the author  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1239) is also indicated by the should do it  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1244) because  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1246) the tool do heavy Oaths and very binding  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1250) us after starting  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1254) thus far in the case two just from us  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1257) to to uh two from other from other  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1261) people  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1263) Manhattan and then we have a reason for  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1266) doubt not just because they're from  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1268) other people but there is maybe they  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1269) deliver things perfectly there's nothing  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1270) to be the doubt about just physically  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1272) fine no problem but if there's any  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1274) reason of Doubt then you can apply to  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1276) the court it must be done by the  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1277) authority and they have to do something  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1279) equivalent to swearing after certain  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1281) hustle now the Believers  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1283) the disabiliters may not have such also  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1285) they may not respect it also what also  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1287) means for us doesn't mean anything in  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1289) that case they have to integrate it  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1291) after such such a ritual of them which  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1294) is very heavy and binding  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1297) whatever the ritual may be for example  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1299) let me give the extreme case of an  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1301) atheist says I don't play I don't  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1304) believe in does God exist but I can make  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1306) an oath under the penalty of bursary  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1309) and On My Honor that is the truth  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1312) nothing that the truth and the completed  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1314) I delivered completely what have been  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1316) given to me from the dying person so and  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1318) so on and I assigned to the effect in  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1321) front of the court and on a pronounce it  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1324) publicly or dictate to someone if he's  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1326) illiterate and put my seal or my thumb  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1327) on it that will be the equivalent of  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1330) salt Russell for a Christian it may be  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1332) taking the Cross and putting it on the  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1334) Bible if it has on top of it for a Jew  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1336) there is no cross but he can put his  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1337) hand on the on the Old Testament  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1339) whatever it is which is equivalent  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1342) and uh so it's from foreign  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1360) from another Faith just inserted between  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1363) under the rest applies to them  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1365) appropriately foreign  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1388) this is only for the believing one for  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1391) them is highly uh highly highly  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1394) respectable and they and they have to  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1397) attend us Allah with the community and  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1398) with the judge and then after Salah they  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1401) are  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1402) brought to the court of law or the  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1403) judges are sitting in the Masjid and  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1405) they do the oath the heavy oath con  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1407) fortified by being after for the  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1409) non-believer clearly doesn't make any  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1411) sense to get them in Salah and all have  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1413) the fortification of solar generally  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1416) so so for so so what what's the meaning  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1421) such a ritual of their side which is as  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1424) binding according to their faith and  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1426) they gave the extreme example over  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1427) atheists even  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1429) so I think it should be read like that  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1431) because that's that's how how Quran  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1434) should be that at most generality which  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1436) does not but across the borders of  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1438) rationality and linguistic limitation  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1441) and they might make an oath by Allah in  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1444) the case of this believer maybe you  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1446) cannot buy their owner or make sure I  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1449) make an author without mentioning Allah  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1450) otherwise  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1455) but under the penalty of perjury that I  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1458) have truthful that I'm telling the whole  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1459) truth I'm not hiding anything the usual  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1461) one was you people put it affidavit in  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1463) Britain which is don't necessarily do  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1465) actually the the English law does not  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1468) specify that you make an oath by Allah  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1469) or by God or anyone just by make an oath  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1472) other penalty of perjury so on so and so  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1474) on  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1475) uh under whatever your regardless as a  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1478) name for this foreign  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1497) Let me Give an example for that  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1500) you may have you may be in trouble in a  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1502) business every time past business travel  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1504) so people under some uh people who are  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1507) not believer  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1508) with you but they are remotely related  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1510) or they from the same tribe and they  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1513) have maybe in low relation with the with  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1515) the with some of the hairs and then they  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1519) hide some of the things or some of the  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1522) instructions written instructions of the  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1524) dying person because this way their  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1526) in-laws will benefit more from that that  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1528) will be British of thrusters will be a  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1531) higher fabrication let me just mention  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1533) so before going through an abstract  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1534) things mention what the story which we  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1538) have uh was supposedly the reason of  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1542) Revelation obviously the national or not  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1545) all nicely synchronized with each other  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1547) but the corner of story seems to be well  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1549) established the story is the following  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1550) admitted to you  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1552) yeah  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1555) yeah so don't make any mistakes  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1557) so this story the main story is narrated  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1559) from  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1561) tabari gives his snad  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1563) also have maybe question here and there  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1567) um  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1569) no this one is good that's from the  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1571) outside of his son Abdul America from  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1574) his father  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1576) a man from balisam  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1579) uh that's uh that his name is Mission  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1581) another narration uh who is by genealogy  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1586) but by Alliance he was a freed slave but  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1588) one of the  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1589) went out  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1591) that time was Christian and he was a  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1593) Christian until late he's famous with  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1595) the Hadith of Justice  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1598) if anyone is interested and his cousin  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1602) or next  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1603) both of them are Christian  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1608) by Alliance uh face death  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1612) and then he and then he entrusted them  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1616) with what he has with him they were  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1618) going for business they they were they  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1620) were usually going between Medina and  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1622) Sham and yeah and Mecca before even  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1624) immigration so then that is  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1627) for a long time and he was most likely  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1630) doing a lot of business with some before  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1632) they immigrated and when they went to  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1634) the Medina if immigration because Moses  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1638) customer and the business partner where  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1640) the one who arrest Islam and went to  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1642) Medina his community was between sham  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1644) and Madina more frequently than  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1647) Mecca but maybe  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1649) other business partners too we don't  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1652) know but that's what and his cousin or  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1654) his brother  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1655) was with him back and forth and one day  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1658) she said his brother maybe his brother  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1660) for a mother only because not the son of  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1662) bada but anyway I can shake it that's  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1664) his trivial points interesting for us  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1666) both our business part and going back  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1668) and forth  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1670) so he gave them what he has with him  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1673) because they were going for business he  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1674) has obviously goods and so on and the  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1676) the most valuable things he had is a pot  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1679) out of silver with with gold  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1681) ornamentation highly valuable heavy and  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1684) highly valuable obviously going to Sham  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1687) where obviously they have the Roman  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1689) Empire and we have three that coming  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1691) going to the Persian Empire this is  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1693) something uh high-class people and Kings  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1695) as I usually buy so he was hoping to get  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1698) some good money for that  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1699) of considerable money because of this  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1702) gold ornamentation like like palm tree  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1705) leaves and so on  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1707) and on clearly you cannot use it Medina  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1710) because using gold and silver poses  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1712) Haram in Islam so whatever it is and  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1714) other things  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1716) so he trusted them with that put the  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1718) things in in suitcases and luggages one  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1721) narration claimed that he wrote  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1724) exactly what is there and hit it  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1726) somewhere in like a small pocket and so  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1728) on in the Box  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1729) just because it's a precaution uh  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1732) another Nation there's nothing to that  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1734) and say about the people back home  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1735) before he went have a good record what  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1737) he has either way it seemed to me I  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1740) don't exclude either I don't exclude  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1742) either I I would say such a seasoned  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1745) business  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1748) whom they trust to travel and so on will  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1751) be with the god we take us enough to  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1753) keep this exact recording of things so  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1755) he will death is approaching he is not  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1756) going to survive so he wrote this  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1758) documentary obviously he's killed their  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1760) writing and so on so it's quite polished  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1761) and educated this person I'll get his  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1763) name shell from the next narration and  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1766) hit it in that and the  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1769) um  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1772) evidence  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1775) or commitment because Christian usually  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1778) the committed Christians are honest and  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1780) and they don't take Liberties the Jews  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1783) they may have some people say even if  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1785) they are practicing they say ah we can  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1787) we can take home we remember we  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1789) discussed that issue and how Allah  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1791) condemned that area in the Quran but  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1793) Christians are not known for that  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1794) generally they are not known for that  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1796) but anyway this man seems to be not as  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1798) that good practice is more of a  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1800) businessman with a bit of lose morality  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1803) so I said okay we'll bring that to your  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1805) family when we back to Medina  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1808) and then  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1810) they could not resist the temptation to  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1812) open one of the of the bags or would  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1814) they know where he have the valuable pot  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1817) gold the gold ornament the silver pot  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1820) and the doctor  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1821) sold it for their own up counts I mean  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1824) let's close everything  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1827) when they delivered  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1831) they go to the family said  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1835) well what's happening we remember that  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1837) he has these and these things or another  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1838) narration said they should they've  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1840) checked and they found this hidden like  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1841) a hidden Pocket they found this this the  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1844) certain documents what is what is all in  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1847) these bags or these suitcases uh and his  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1850) luggage and something is missing  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1853) and the the other nations say then  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1855) either either by this or by this or by  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1858) both it could be very well that make the  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1860) check the records so it's very  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1862) reasonable to check records  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1879) maybe he was sick for a long time and he  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1882) decided something to spend on his result  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1884) responsible also no no no  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1886) the gifted no so she said but this item  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1890) is missing based on that  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1893) there was a doubt about this this  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1896) handing over of this so they went to the  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1898) messenger Allah said without these  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1900) people because we have this Reasonable  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1902) Doubt at least some doubt  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1904) that something is missing and these guys  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1907) maybe have taken it it may someone it  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1910) may be it was stolen from him  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1912) but if he has written a record that  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1914) would be but I don't know the story of  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1916) the thing before this question about it  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1917) anyway  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1919) we don't know  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1921) so the Messenger will ask him to make an  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1923) author and they make an oath  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1926) and that's it and the matter was settled  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1929) now this narration is very Abridged  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1931) another narration is more expanded it  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1934) says  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1936) and the other thing was was the later on  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1938) the the pot was found either in sham or  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1943) in in in in Mecca or a third narration  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1947) claim that himself after embracing Islam  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1949) felt guilty and admitted to them so  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1951) you're allowed to them that we we we we  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1953) we just we broke the trust and we sold  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1956) that and put the money in our pocket I  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1958) took 500 Dirham and uh  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1961) whatever how it was detected the pot was  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1965) mostly I think the most reasonable  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1966) stories that was found in Mecca because  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1968) maybe they proceed to Mecca and thought  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1970) Mac has far away and hostile to become  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1972) before the conquest of Makkah to Medina  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1975) nobody will will come to but somehow  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1978) some people saw it in Mecca and reported  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1980) to them and then they is investigated a  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1983) little bit and they tell out that the  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1984) the those who have it in America saying  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1986) we bought it from them  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1988) so now now the plot is clear so Next  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1992) Step they they went to the messenger of  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1995) Allah with this now with these facts  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=1999) no there's not doubt anymore these are  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2001) the factory had been determined  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2004) that it's sold by away and that so their  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2008) testimony and the oath that have  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2009) delivered everything they did not take  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2010) anything if they have sold it and  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2012) there's good reason that uh what what we  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2015) have investigated Mecca is through  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2017) because the other guys they have no  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2019) interest to accuse to to be to to  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2022) telling that we bought it from XYZ which  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2024) is not mixed with oh yeah we bought them  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2027) from these two guys not from from armor  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2029) or Zed or from these two  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2031) so they went for the messenger Allah  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2034) and they said  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2036) despite of these are clearly the author  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2038) of that has been shown that this is  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2040) false oath these two but they asked the  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2042) the  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2043) people do you have a further Evidence  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2046) than just male that it had been found  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2049) there  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2053) and they say no say are you winning R2  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2056) from you are willing to make an oath by  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2058) Allah that our our that investigation is  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2061) more reliable more trustworthy than the  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2063) initial claim of of these two guys they  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2066) said you are winning and in one I said  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2068) one of them was so it means the story  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2070) must be after before the conquest of  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2072) Mecca but after immigrated together  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2074) because he immigrated in the in the  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2077) library time so in that time of living  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2080) so it must be after that or even maybe  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2083) after the conquest of Mecca we don't  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2084) know what's happened anyway it's  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2086) relatively late so let's say eighth year  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2088) 9th seventh year eight year nine year so  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2091) it's quite early sorry  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2092) and then the Quran  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2094) came down to uh to confirm the survive  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2098) whatever you think  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2100) I'll keep it on record the wisdom of  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2102) that has skipped a record  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2104) one of it is that  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2106) when you previously link that everything  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2109) is fine and the witnesses have been they  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2111) made even for the Lost witnesses that  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2114) you can open a code because this crazy  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2115) became final and everything was as it is  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2118) until New Evidence came forward to in on  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2122) the balance show that these guys have  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2123) lied  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2124) any any court case which someone lies or  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2128) there's a collusion or something like  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2129) that even in the Western in the in the  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2131) UK law and most laws or another  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2133) fundamental effect in the in the  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2135) proceeding can be worth it even if it  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2137) has confined it was fine and people  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2139) distributed the money and initials were  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2141) done everything is gone  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2143) it can't be still over 10. so this this  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2144) point nobody from characteristics  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2146) scholar or tabari has stressed so it can  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2149) be over 10 but in that is not enough  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2151) that that uh that that's proven that we  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2153) Allied because the real the truth may be  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2156) something else we don't know uh maybe  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2158) they have forgotten maybe we don't know  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2161) what's exactly so they have to make to  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2164) affirm their right by making an oath  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2166) they just found out that our result of  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2168) Investigation we are convinced that our  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2170) result of Investigation is preferable  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2174) and stronger than their oath and and  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2177) this way  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2179) so they have to do the author in the  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2182) name of Allah that same way and then  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2184) they will be then then the other ones  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2187) will be would be found guilty and they  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2188) are forced to retain what they have  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2190) resolved and and theft it doesn't need  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2193) to be like like a such a gold item or  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2196) other merchandise could be for example  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2197) give you an example a document for  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2200) example  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2201) someone is traveling with other people  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2204) and then if his death is coming and in  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2207) that trouble or maybe he married a woman  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2209) in another city and did not tell his  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2211) family but whatever he said it's not  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2212) good not to do that because you see how  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2214) it can happen but now he felt guilty  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2216) that she may be neglected from  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2218) inheritance or should should be accused  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2221) so realize the documentation to let let  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2223) me know that I am married to a lady so  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2225) and so on that's her address so if I if  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2228) if I die my companion will bring this  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2230) document with them to you so that you  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2233) don't take care you don't allocate her  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2235) right in health for example and one of  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2238) these guys is the relative tool  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2240) to maybe a wife of this one who is dying  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2243) or to an in-law and you say ah this will  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2246) reduce the share of myself my my uh uh  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2250) that wife the other wife which related  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2252) to me or reduce the share of other  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2254) in-laws now let me hide it don't deliver  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2256) it  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2257) and later on things come to the daylight  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2260) that woman come and bring witnesses  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2262) there for the marriage and so on and and  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2265) it's a it is the expose that they have  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2269) done the obviously the the the the  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2271) people have to make an author and make  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2273) sure that our our  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2275) our submissions are more reliable and  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2279) more than these people who have hidden  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2280) that documents Well it can't be a  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2282) document usually people not hide the  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2284) document which has no monetary value  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2286) that's what's human nature is  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2287) unfortunately human greed what it is  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2289) everywhere  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2291) so so this is the story clarify what's  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2293) going on so it is what really all these  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2295) great Witnesses Etc in the Ayah is  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2297) actually meaning Oaths because really  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2300) they are delivering documents or  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2301) delivering Goods  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2303) so there's just an oath that we  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2305) delivered everything and we do not help  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2306) withheld anything that we did not take  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2308) anything for us or did not hide anything  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2310) for our own interest or anyone who is  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2313) maybe next of kin who may benefit from  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2315) hiding or absolutely clean neutral not  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2318) benefiting or harming anybody by any  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2321) intention  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2322) so that's that's clarify this and also  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2324) that point of that there's such a final  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2326) ruling can be uh can be uh can be uh uh  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2331) or a case can be opened and then the  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2333) previous ruling can be declared null and  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2334) void is is clearly that's one of the  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2337) reasons I think the Ayah is enshrining  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2340) that because it seems to be that I came  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2341) at the end after all of that was settled  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2344) Allah did not interfere in the whole  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2346) process until it has completed and then  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2349) that that I was able to record that and  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2352) give put the system in place until you  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2355) almost came unfortunately most most  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2357) Focus actually got stuck with with the  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2359) imaginary conception the most problem  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2362) they had is that a witness could be  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2364) unuslim and they try to beat around the  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2367) bush and so on but already answered them  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2369) very strongly persuasively and even  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2371) hasn't bashed them badly for that so it  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2374) is a mockery to claim that's two or two  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2377) just Witnesses from you meaning from  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2379) your own tribe or immoral City and from  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2381) the others Allah  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2384) from you meaning from the believing  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2386) Community for the believer  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2388) and the witnesses from outside you is  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2390) the one from not from the believer  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2392) because the address is to the believer  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2393) or you believe is not the address to the  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2395) people of Medina or or people of a  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2398) village or a tribe and the address of  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2400) colonies usually to the believer Ali  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2402) says clearly said this is  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2404) addressed to the people in the in the  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2406) immigration domain like for example will  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2409) come to it that this is that you have no  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2412) no Allegiance or or or belonging to  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2417) those who breastfeed but did not  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2419) immigrate so it's clearly addressing the  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2421) immigrants though people certain in  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2423) Medina the domain of immigration  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2427) Islam those who did not immigrate do not  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2429) have the all the rights and and the  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2431) aggregation  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2432) from a text that is addressing those in  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2436) the immigration domain only  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2438) they don't have any relation with those  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2440) until they immigrate except if they ask  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2442) for help because they are present  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2444) religion then help them all conditions  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2446) so and so on so on will come to that  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2448) sort of function it's a very important  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2449) issue with Allegiance so the address  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2452) holds to the believer  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2454) and all the believer even if they  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2456) outside the Islamic domain even if they  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2458) are living under the ruling of copper  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2460) by legitimately or even Symphony this is  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2463) totally believable to exclude someone  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2465) you have to bring at everything  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2466) exclusion so this is a mockery that  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2469) people do  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2470) sometimes in this  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2472) so that's it now I actually I mentioned  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2475) the story I mentioned there are  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2477) essentially the content of the next Ayah  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2478) so let's read the next Ayah and this  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2481) translation and then put everything  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2483) together already already have been put  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2486) together so the next I will read thus in  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2489) the case some evidence found later on  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2492) after the first case was set up and done  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2494) that those fellows have lied  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2497) either with certainty or high  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2499) probability like the case of Tamil with  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2502) Daddy and Adib  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2505) the next is  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2516) yeah  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2517) foreign  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2533) but if after they should come to mind  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2536) that two witnesses have come become  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2538) guilty of this very sin uh then two  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2541) others from among those who those who  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2544) from the whom the former have deprived  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2546) of their right shall take their place  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2548) and swear by God  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2551) Our Testimony is indeed truer than the  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2553) testimony of these two and we have not  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2556) transgressed the bounds of what is right  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2558) or else we may indeed be counted among  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2561) the evildoers next translation if it is  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2564) discovered that these two are guilty of  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2566) this sin then two of those whose rights  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2568) have been usedur have a bite better  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2570) right to bear witness let them swear to  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2573) God our testimony is truer than the  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2576) testimony of these two and we have not  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2578) committed perjury because that would  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2580) make us unjust  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2582) so it's not only that that they found  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2586) evidence that the initial two have  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2589) committed sin or  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2592) broke the trust in certain parts of full  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2595) of the system of the or say of the Wind  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2598) or the requested request no not all  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2600) that's not enough by itself is not  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2603) enough but this is  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2605) enough to open the code in the court  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2606) case and then they have to do these  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2608) Oaths in the fraud it has to be in a  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2610) court case they said the old case has to  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2613) be of attend in a court case it cannot  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2615) be just outside the court it has to be  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2617) done the same the same quarter of  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2619) jurisdiction which in which the first  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2620) event has happened let's say in the same  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2622) one it has to be  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2624) it has to as we perform so they have  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2627) they have to bring that evidence the  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2629) reason like in the case of this that the  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2631) people said we have we have uh  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2633) accidentally came to our knowledge that  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2635) this the spot this valuable pot was  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2638) found in Makkah or whoever this was  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2641) and uh people were asked casually where  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2644) did you get that from so we bought that  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2646) from Tami with Daddy and daddy so  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2649) completely  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2650) unaware about anything otherwise  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2653) completely assuming any sentence that  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2655) I've dealed they are the owner and they  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2657) bought from them completely instantly  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2659) nothing nothing indicating that the  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2661) people in Mecca are lying or trying to  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2663) accuse us  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2664) of something which is not true because  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2666) it's completely unrelated so this is a  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2668) very strong evidence that something  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2670) fishy is happily has happened with the  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2673) foreign  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2701) according to their proportion Etc so  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2704) that's all what happened  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2706) I'm not sure if they were punished or  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2708) not punished but anyway that's it if the  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2711) public law or if the Imam has a major  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2713) injunction that for such pleasure is  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2715) there a certain penalty or certain  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2717) lashes or imprisonment maybe  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2720) this will be penalty Penal Code actually  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2722) is because penalty for perjury is left  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2725) to uh to to be enacted by the Surah and  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2727) IMAP the details of it but it's sinful  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2730) and and it relates to to the public  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2735) order which Imam has to step I'm  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2737) relating to our discussion the previous  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2738) time yes it is  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2741) a public issue and also it entails this  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2745) uh  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2746) contempt of court and another mining of  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2748) the cost proceeding which should be  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2750) prevented by all means and by all costs  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2751) so this is a public order offense in  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2753) which the certain penalty can be  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2755) prescribed by the law but this is not  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2757) our issue here  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2758) so that's what happened the thing with  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2760) Daddy later on says telling the truth  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2763) yes me and Adib  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2766) we took the thing and and one narration  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2769) I think it's maybe someone trying to  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2771) give out the idea um there is some  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2774) better image for that that he after  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2776) embracing Islam felt guilty  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2778) and admitted that I went to see your  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2780) land give the people a 500 told him the  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2782) other 500  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2784) universe and sued him in front of the  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2786) Prophet it could be that but the the  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2789) story of that it found in in in in in  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2791) Mecca and also the good report for him  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2794) saying Allah  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2797) we broke the trust we stole that item  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2800) sold it bring more stronger that that  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2804) both of them were with and shamed and so  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2806) on possibly but anyway it doesn't make  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2807) any difference this or this it's  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2810) ultimately the initial quote ruling then  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2812) became final and everything was disputed  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2815) after has been overturned by opening the  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2819) case because the initial one has a  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2821) fundamental defect in this case it is a  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2823) perjury perjury is always in in every  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2826) law system I think for example in the UK  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2828) is is enough reason to even even the  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2830) guys ruling has become final  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2832) and even if this had become final  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2834) hundred years ago UK law you can open  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2837) the case  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2838) and it can be written there's even no no  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2841) statutory status of limitation  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2843) in this in a case of British of trust  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2847) and so on there's no set of Soul  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2848) meditation that's the cannot be at least  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2851) they have a status of limitation or  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2853) something like that but not in the UK  
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2855) though for South American law  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2857) Islamic law  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2859) so that's that's roughly this and there  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2862) are very many fine points of issues  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2864) there which were discussed by tabari I  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2867) think they deserve some maybe a writing  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2869) but since we are not through the in  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2872) involved very much in fine in fact and  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2875) so on but because so many issues have  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2878) been related to the issues of witnesses  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2881) of non-muslim  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2882) understandable conception and people  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2885) following their imagination and and  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2888) projecting things which clearly  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2891) contradicts the scripture I think I  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2892) remember you remember maybe when when I  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2895) mentioned the story about Witnesses long  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2896) ago that when when sahabi was found  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2899) killed in the Bible I think I had  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2901) reported a story  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2903) and then His companion came and found  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2905) him dead and then they could not they  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2908) didn't find any trace of any action they  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2910) don't know who was doing it Etc so they  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2912) came to the messenger a lot complete  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2915) about that that's after the conquest of  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2916) Highborn it became under the control of  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2918) Islam and there were Jews were living  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2920) there and extending the land and so on  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2922) with the share 50 50 or something like  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2923) that  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2925) and um  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2927) and uh and they said this is there's  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2930) nobody nobody living there except shoes  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2933) but  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2935) [Music]  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2947) we have broken the Covenant they  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2950) answered him back  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2954) we swear by Allah we did not do we did  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2957) not we should not know who did that  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2962) Adam asked them ask of the family of the  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2965) deceased  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2967) are you willing if you suspect someone  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2969) specifically and you know about  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2970) something for good reasons for whatever  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2972) you with your your investigation or past  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2975) interaction with the people  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2977) are are you willing to 50 men of you to  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2980) stand and make an oath balance called  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2981) kasama  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2982) uh that this guy is is the one who did  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2986) then he will be delivered to you with  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2988) with his rope so you can exclude him and  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2990) do whatever whatever he wants with him  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2992) he said we do not see anybody  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2994) we we  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2995) speculate maybe this and this but we  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2997) didn't see how can we make 50 or Thrift  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=2999) five men standing up and even this fifty  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3002) Orton jail leader kasama was so so  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3004) respected that all reports that anyone  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3007) doing kasama and relying in it does not  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3010) survive one year he will die before so  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3012) that was so widespread after all false I  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3014) don't know so I spread that kasama was  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3016) like like a Holy Grail nobody could  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3019) touch  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3020) no no way you can do so then I will ask  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3022) you at the Jones to make a Hassam and  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3025) decide that they don't know what they're  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3026) saying these are kofar who don't accept  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3028) everything but what my point is that he  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3030) tell them then the Jews will do for some  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3033) 50 of them so 50 of them like 50 Muslims  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3035) don't escape understand Prophet said  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3037) that's all that they can give you then  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3040) because he did not he disliked that the  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3043) blood of this Muslim would be shed for a  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3045) Love or and and God vain he paid his  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3048) dear his blood money from the treasury  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3051) just for it to to just for for the let's  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3054) say for the uh to a piece that the  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3056) people have for the loss and make them  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3058) feel happy that's it but that's that's  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3060) clear they cannot get more than than uh  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3062) the equal number like the other side but  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3064) it's not escape from that so that  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3066) evidence that this is the witness of  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3067) others is equity equally equivalent in  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3070) the case of kasama there's no issue of  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3071) just or no just so beautiful it's 50 men  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3074) 50 men or 50 people even that it doesn't  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3077) specify I mean  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3083) because woman was usually not involved  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3086) in any public life or or prevalence also  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3089) like barely and if you ask a woman to  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3091) come and do herself and say I was never  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3093) on fire but you are the one going back  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3094) up for the lab in the business oh how  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3096) can I watch this for anything that's  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3098) silly but but even that  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3100) so that's that's very that's very that's  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3103) very clear that this this misconception  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3105) is so deep that the people just read  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3107) this Hadith and read the eye of the  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3108) Quran with closed eyes they are not  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3110) opening their eyes  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3111) unfortunately but we have to organize  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3113) because we have to open this those who  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3115) contain the habit and then ultimately  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3118) they continue with them quoting this  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3120) companion this companion the sahabi this  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3122) one said that he said as only accept the  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3125) witnesses of non-muslim only in on in  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3128) travel only in Russia  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3130) and who said that's only in trouble the  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3133) Ayah said in that case that's that's the  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3134) case but what's about the other cases if  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3137) it is there it may be another one also  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3138) so for Miss ayak there's no no exclusion  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3142) if Allah wanted to exclude they say  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3143) otherwise don't accept  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3145) witness for many non-muslims no no  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3148) that's it that says clearly adding  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3150) things from their imagination and  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3152) subscribing things by by just by desire  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3154) not by really giving the text it's due  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3156) respect  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3158) so that's that's that's it and and uh in  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3161) a nutshell uh and uh and the the  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3165) probably discussed very fine linguistic  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3167) issues and so on which is an intriguing  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3169) and so that is a matter of really more  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3171) detergent but this is the general  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3172) picture clearly the witnesses of of of  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3175) kaffir is is acceptable no problem maybe  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3179) you notice um some people may not desire  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3181) it because usually the Muslim Community  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3183) and the others living in separation  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3185) generally so  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3187) practically there will be little  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3189) interaction except like in this  
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3190) situation or in businesses and so on but  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3193) this is not the case forever for example  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3195) with advancing of time  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3197) uh the the the  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3199) Muslims have been visiting uh people  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3202) with a book doctors and and pharmacists  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3205) because they are usually they were they  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3206) were more skilled in these areas for  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3207) centuries and vice versa and there will  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3211) be interaction there would be issues  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3212) with Witnesses and so on and there's no  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3214) reason to think that the witnesses is is  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3216) this acceptable than anybody else  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3219) and uh in in modern times for example  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3222) something like that may happen then you  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3224) have local lawyers who are the very  
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3226) reliable trustworthy what they call  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3228) things and communicated but still if  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3231) you're doubting the lawyer that he did  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3232) something for improval which happens  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3234) also by the way lawyers also not  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3236) infallible there have been cases of  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3239) British of transform lawyers if you have  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3241) some doubt they will be forced to make  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3243) an oath and if later evidence come  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3245) forward they will be forced obviously  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3247) and and punished for perjury according  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3249) to the the valid Public Law Etc  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3252) so that's a that's a that's all these  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3255) these uh they're just just whispering in  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3258) someone's ear assuming things which are  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3261) based on such imaginary concept  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3265) uh yeah lack of Alexandria of women  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3267) Witnesses because of the is we discussed  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3271) which is not true  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3272) Decemberists thing told a few that say  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3274) oh the criminal issues for example look  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3276) at that  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3278) condemnation husband and wife were using  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3280) his wife adultery and then his his  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3282) witness is actually his oath he has to  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3285) make thought of that that he's doing the  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3287) truth and the second and the fifth one  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3288) is that Allah uh care should be upon him  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3292) with his lying and she can counteract  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3294) with that with eighth also and no with  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3296) four authors so one against one so how  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3298) come the two the the they claim that  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3300) universally witness of a woman is the  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3302) half of a manner or something like this  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3304) is all it's just uh what they call  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3307) psychological projection it has nothing  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3309) to do with the text the text is clear  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3310) and the textures is not even a shahada  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3313) it's not it's the Shad the the comment  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3316) of that it's written committed the  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3318) writing and in addition  
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3319) Witnesses are called in Estes  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3323) called in  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3324) and that is called in  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3327) as we said two men or one man and two  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3330) women  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3331) and the question is reason why the two  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3334) women and said because if one of the  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3336) does not remember then the other one  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3339) will remind here which is establishing  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3341) two principles one principle is that  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3343) that even Witnesses could remind each  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3346) other and support each other that's not  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3347) a problem but we do it best on what on a  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3350) written document already so just no I  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3353) don't remember correctly that was said  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3355) secondly the reason was it was only um a  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3360) woman for one man is very simple because  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3362) either the the the female memory  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3367) concerning abstract things like a  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3368) debtors something abstract you're not  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3370) witnessing someone being overrun by a  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3373) car or a wall collapsing on someone  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3375) something you see visible that's very  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3377) visible Witnesses for women they tend to  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3379) be better invisible Witnesses than than  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3381) men and they notice things visually  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3384) especially dressed and so on better than  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3386) men we know that you can you can go in  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3388) any in any wedding and so on and you  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3390) will notice after after the wedding that  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3393) your wife will tell you for example that  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3395) have you seen this this man or this  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3397) woman dressed like this and this and who  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3399) did not notice anything they have they  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3401) have an eye for that but abstract things  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3403) like a written document and so on  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3404) especially but is that is that genuinely  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3407) because of the brain structure of Life  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3409) brain or it is because of the society  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3411) situation that they were barely involved  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3412) in businesses to be settled you have to  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3415) be analyz but  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3416) let's say it is so Wiki but so that's  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3419) only for Witnesses in uh for Witnesses  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3423) uh invoked and invited to comment that's  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3428) it the next of the ISA well but if it is  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3432) if you are dealing with the  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3433) transactional with goods and services  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3435) being exchanged there's no debt or  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3437) something like that then and you are  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3440) doing buying and selling right away  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3441) immediately hand in hand but they call  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3446) it  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3447) um  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3448) immediate cash transaction immediately  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3450) immediate transaction then it's enough  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3452) to say ah anyone presents witness that  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3455) we have exchange of something like that  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3457) and nowadays the people have the receipt  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3459) of that Hill which is replace that  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3461) anyway so it's enough of all the major  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3464) transactions would be usually witnessing  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3466) but more more thoroughly than that and  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3468) they say uh does not say men or women or  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3472) two or ten just just help just have some  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3475) witnesses  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3476) for this in addition to the fact that it  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3479) has been exchanged have we done everyone  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3480) has here but there may be some defect  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3482) later or something so then your such  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3485) weakness will be good due to water safer  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3487) nowadays the still receipt or other  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3489) receipts are but are sufficient instead  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3491) of that so you see uh even the next part  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3495) of the eye this dimension of two men  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3497) order or one man and two women or  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3499) another we just actually do General  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3502) and there's no reason to to  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3504) get this at the one specific for the  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3507) specific case  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3508) on on a dead instrument which has to be  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3510) commented the writing with this specific  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3512) injunction to make it Universal in  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3514) general  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3515) so they go to the specific and make it  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3518) by players general which is faulty  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3520) although the same I the next one does  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3522) not specify anything like that  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3528) so so this is just uh give us some  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3530) benefit also in hotel which over  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3532) non-muslims and Muslims for the  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3533) witnesses and also men and women has  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3535) been dispatched in other eyes but  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3538) as that  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3541) and still majority of Scholars choose  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3543) just to close their eyes while reading  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3544) that all this was some people get this  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3547) is  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3547) only in this case but imagine and I in  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3551) the Quran with such sophistication  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3552) because the structure of the island  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3554) linguistical is one of the most  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3555) sophisticated in the Quran  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3557) that needs really  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3559) marshaling the the battery of Arabic  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3562) grammar and so on to analyze certain  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3564) terms like potable he did considerable  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3567) but this is only for the first for the  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3569) very picky specialist of the Arabic  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3571) language  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3573) it says and it is sometimes so it is not  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3577) as multiple meaning and difficult to  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3579) envisage like the Aya and sorted  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3584) Witchcraft and things like that  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3587) but it is difficult to get it really  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3590) expanded in such a way that or in fact  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3593) luckily we have here obviously a case a  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3596) case which we can analyze and compare  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3598) with the eye and then give us a guidance  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3600) although it's not necessary but probably  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3602) made most of the analysis without even  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3604) referring to these narratives about  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3605) Tamir daddy and his uh brother or  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3609) whatever it is  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3610) succeed in doing all of that without it  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3613) only at the antibody stores at the far  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3616) end he did not need that just from the  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3619) language the same with hardwood models  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3621) we don't have a actual case to compare  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3623) so it remains dark and this is I think  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3626) deliberate in the Quran to keep the  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3627) issue of wood of of Witchcraft and so on  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3630) as dark as possible because it is a  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3633) destination of which God and not to get  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3635) the people into into a complex research  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3639) of of all these things related to what  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3642) is really what is this and what which  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3644) one it is the one who type cover which  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3646) one and how is the effect on on on  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3649) husband and wife so that it can be  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3651) separated by Sir which is very condemned  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3653) obviously in the Quran that's the  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3654) maximum cell but this case is given as  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3657) the maximum they can achieve so all  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3659) these stories that whether someone has  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3660) been butched and turned into a donkey is  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3662) just nonsense that's nothing that's just  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3665) a suggested  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3666) Imagination Running white but that that  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3669) eye is very dark in that suspect this IO  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3672) is very complex in the linguistic  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3673) structure in that respect needs some  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3676) some hard work relatively hard work and  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3679) a few eyes in the Quran like that but  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3681) then ultimately when you flesh them out  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3683) and analyze  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3685) you'll get an enormous amount of  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3687) information and injunction which maybe  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3689) even the classical scholar did not  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3691) notice like the issue of attaining a  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3693) court rolling which has become final Etc  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3695) it is some people think there's nowhere  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3697) we're not here in the Quran in front of  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3699) you but you do not see it you have to  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3701) dig deeper  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3702) you have to do the double of the Quran  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3706) lies it more thoroughly than that and  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3708) also things like that especially if that  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3710) level of complex complexity is also on  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3713) the evidence of the of the divine nature  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3716) of the column because no way uh a  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3718) Shepherd who did a bit for business  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3720) transaction in Mecca who is illiterate  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3722) no way he will get to all these  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3723) sophisticated things and phrase things  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3725) such as sophisticated way  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3727) how eloquently may be but this all these  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3730) legalistic principles in that in that  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3732) with this in such a uh how many lines  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3736) are those five lines  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3738) and the number of words with count them  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3740) which are usually expanded in low books  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3743) for example written in in tens and  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3745) hundreds of pages  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3747) all hidden there you just need to dig it  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3749) out just can't can't be that that uh  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3752) despite where you definitely was a  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3755) qualified man an intelligent but it's  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3757) not is it not within it was in the reach  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3759) not even the issue of the people of  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3760) Arabia not even the ratio of the  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3762) companies after him they struggle to  
[1:02:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3763) understand what's going on and reduce  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3765) Rose from that  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3767) that's that's one of the evidences so  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3768) well the rest of the Quran  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3770) straightforward symbolism can't be from  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3772) anybody maybe but this one  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3775) and so on and these things cannot be and  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3778) more will come in a few moments  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3779) inshallah  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3783) so then the commenting of the whole  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3785) story  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3800) so translate  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3802) thus it would be more likely that people  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3805) will offer testimony in accordance with  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3807) the truth or else they will have cause  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3809) to fear that their Oaths will be refuted  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3812) by the elves of others be then conscious  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3815) of God and hearken unto him for God does  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3818) not bestow his guidance upon iniquities  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3820) folk his translation it will be more  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3823) likely that people will offer the truth  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3825) in their testimony because because they  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3827) will be afraid that others might refute  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3830) their Oaths remain mindful of God and  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3833) listen God does not guide those who are  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3835) defiantly disobedient so it's very clear  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3837) this this procedure which looks a little  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3840) bit complex with all supported and also  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3843) the other side Force towards everyone's  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3845) supposed to so for us to do the  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3847) necessary also and so on and and  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3849) Confirmation is that this is more likely  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3852) to bring  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3853) that the people will bring witnesses as  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3855) it should be and or they would be afraid  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3858) that their witnesses will be rejected  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3859) and they would be scandalized as Earth  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3861) breaker or scandalized as perjurious  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3864) people and so on with these safeguards  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3866) everyone will be alert listen  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3868) you will be I don't think that if you  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3871) lie today and they get a get away in the  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3873) court in the court and get a final  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3875) ruling don't think the finality of the  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3877) ruling will save you the moment some  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3880) evidence come elsewhere that case will  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3882) be will be stuck down to zero because it  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3884) was null and void of initial as it has  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3887) never been so finality don't fool  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3890) yourself about penalty that's finality  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3891) can be overtained I gave an example and  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3894) I came like as the famous so what is the  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3896) Birmingham six over the the famous story  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3898) it was you which which was one of the  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3901) dark spots in British uh criminal  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3904) history which will accuse the bombing  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3906) and say yeah I think it's the word  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3908) yeah Birmingham six and so on uh clearly  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3911) the all the evidences now showed that  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3914) the the Midland uh West Midland Police  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3917) have committed perjury and Light  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3920) nobody was punished really as it should  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3923) be unfortunately because the regime  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3924) itself is colluding behind that an evil  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3926) but the individual of that ultimately  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3929) it became final even the House of Lords  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3932) but later on because of pressure of evil  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3934) investigating and so on the the in in in  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3937) the UK although unfortunately such  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3940) things had to be an opening should be  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3942) done by the Home Secretary it cannot be  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3944) done by anyone but this is a shortcoming  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3946) of the of the UK  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3948) a bad shortcoming anyone who have  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3951) there's necessary evidence can have an  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3954) interest in that either is a party or in  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3956) that case because it's a is a criminal  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3958) case of the public terrorism  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3960) allegitalism act everyone in the public  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3963) is is also a party he could anyone could  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3966) have applied to the court and asked to  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3967) open the case instead of fighting with  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3970) the home office for several years while  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3972) people were rotting and in jail for that  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3974) time but this is also bad access  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3976) man-made law is like that that's here no  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3979) anyone who is really having interest or  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3981) relation here obviously inheritance only  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3983) the hairs and the relative I mean  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3985) there's anybody else is not involved and  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3988) normally he will not uh do uh anything  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3991) in that direction maybe someone find  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3993) that accident likes their people finding  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3994) by accident that the tamim and daddy did  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=3997) sell that that uh valuable pot  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4001) and and they inform the family or  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4003) something like that but then the family  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4004) has to do the one of the parties were  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4006) interested party then the case will open  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4009) and it will be over 10 based on the new  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4011) evidences and Witnesses  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4014) unfortunately even here in the UK  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4016) despite of all this grudging back and  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4017) forth back and forth back and forth that  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4019) was as far as I remember the West uh the  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4022) the West Midland the police got away  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4025) nobody got really punished or fired or  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4027) something because of that which is a  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4029) very grave shot coming but anyway that's  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4031) it's nothing this is not an Islamic  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4033) domain no we can't account him by  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4035) Islamic law  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4036) so with these safeguards and the  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4040) possibility of attending lawyers but in  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4042) the forward process with the proper  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4043) Witnesses and so on then everyone will  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4046) be concerned hopefully  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4048) let's tell people providing what they  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4051) are they're still violating  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4054) but this is more likely to reduce the  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4057) number of such incidents in which things  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4061) did we attend  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4064) the final appeal is to your own  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4066) Consciousness to remember and be  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4068) conscious  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4070) beware of Allah and listen to The  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4073) Commandments  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4074) Allah does not guide the rebellious  
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4076) people but don't go because these  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4080) Witnesses under oath there isism being  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4083) being doing as a perjury knowingly that  
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4086) you are lying is a major sin well  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4088) possibly bordering uncover Allah does  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4090) not to guide the the uh the rebellious  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4093) people the fasepin the what's the letter  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4096) how do you translate  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4098) what's the manifestly rebellious or the  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4101) how did the last translation translates  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4103) the word faster P for a second  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4105) [Music]  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4107) definitely disobedient to know that when  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4109) they buy their device yeah  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4113) so or rebellious sorry or stubbornly  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4116) disobedient  
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4119) you know for example when you uh do just  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4122) the  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4123) um  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4124) Almighty one of the five you know  
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4126) classical women classical invention you  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4128) mentioned previously that it's  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4130) invariably linked to disbelief  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4133) most of the time but in some places it  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4137) may be but if you scan everywhere it's  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4139) usually okay because Adam is never the  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4144) applying cells ASAP never ever  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4148) disobeyed foreign  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4165) or something like that and this this  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4168) moment of weakness he he thought that  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4171) that's it now I will I will overcome  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4174) this  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4179) is very very thoughtful and very very  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4182) very very very determined and very  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4184) rebellious  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4185) rejecting the command  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4189) so if you're taking the Quran  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4191) but in other places  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4197) it needs to be analyzed but generally  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4200) your Main Street Fighter you should have  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4203) the alarm built  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4204) the buildings then you open your eyes  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4207) wide under analyze further let's say  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4210) like as a general rule  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4212) yeah  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4214) and then immediately go through  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4216) omokuyama in another issue is related to  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4219) the beginning of this world I remember  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4220) the beginning not in the beginning it  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4222) was no it's a beginning that was  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4223) actually a discussion about Teresa but  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4226) it's not a disorder we didn't have  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4227) anything out  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4229) so  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4230) Allah does not guide the rebellious  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4232) people especially  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4234) this whole situation or the that will  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4236) come in the day of judgment apparent but  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4239) the major issue with blood will be  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4241) discussed Allah  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4246) so translate this one generally  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4250) this is General warning for all  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4252) transgression and shortcomings of people  
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4254) in Dunya and near me all this will be  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4257) questioned  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4259) on the day when God shall assemble all  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4261) the apostles and shall ask what response  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4265) did you receive they will answer we have  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4268) no knowledge verily it is thou alone who  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4271) fully noticed all the things that are  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4273) beyond the reach of a creative being's  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4275) perception next translation on the day  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4278) when God assembles all the messengers  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4280) and asks what response did you receive I  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4284) will answer we have no knowledge you  
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4286) alone know the things that cannot be  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4288) seen  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4289) yeah because even if they have some  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4292) believer there's no guarantee that all  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4294) these would pretend to believe a True  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4296) Believer  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4297) we have discussed that and we discussed  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4299) the various ayas about more African  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4301) especially in Turbo will have massive  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4303) discussion of that  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4304) which Islam on the face of these guys  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4306) there's those so-called salafi and even  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4308) the people of Sunnah claim also have all  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4310) of the models  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4317) but this will come to that issue  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4320) inshallah morphology  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4322) so even in that they can say no some  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4325) some people some people even they're  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4327) available  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4330) on the Mind fountain  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4333) I see people I know them and they know  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4335) me and they approach  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4336) and when they're about to  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4338) get to drink from the fountain obviously  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4341) they're done  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4342) doing that with them deliberately an  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4345) angel comes they must stop them and  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4346) pulls them with harshness and get get  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4349) out from here go back or be possibly  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4351) beating them with with the with the with  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4354) the fire whips  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4355) on the same my Lord my God this is my my  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4358) companion so everyone says my my little  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4362) companions also say hey because they're  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4364) already used for your kids my son my my  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4367) son my son let things like that what's  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4369) happening and then she said don't worry  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4371) you don't know what they have done after  
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4373) you let's manage them  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4375) they were going backwards leaving that  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4378) what you have instructed to them yeah  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4380) I said where they are taking lips in for  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4381) the head fired then I say it I'm  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4383) seriously I will say  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4385) destruction down to those who change  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4388) after that what I have left them so  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4392) they don't know the messenger was really  
[1:13:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4394) the realest ones and later they canceled  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4396) I know this one I know this one but  
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4397) that's it but the nation of Southern  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4399) Motel no idea  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4401) we don't know but you know all things  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4403) what's what's usually called hidden  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4404) which is not accessible to the creation  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4407) and then the conclusion the third what  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4410) will be the questioning for Israel  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4413) is  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4422) foreign  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4449) remember the blessing which I bestowed  
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4452) upon thee and thy mother how I  
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4454) strengthen thee with holy inspiration so  
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4456) that thou could speak unto men in my in  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4459) thy cradle and as a grown man and how I  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4461) imparted upon the Revelation and wisdom  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4464) including the Torah and the gospel and  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4467) how by my leave thou this create out of  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4469) clay as it were the shape of thy  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4472) followers Destiny and this breathe unto  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4476) into it so that it may become by my  
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4479) leave their Destiny and how thou didst  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4482) heal the Blind and the leper by my leave  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4485) and how thou didst raise the dead by my  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4489) leave and how I prevented the children  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4491) of Israel from harming thee without  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4494) chemist unto them with all the evidence  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4497) all evidence of the truth  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4498) and when those of them who are bent on  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4501) denying the truth was saying this is  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4503) clearly nothing but deception let's  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4505) translation  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4506) God will say Jesus Son of Mary remember  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4508) the grace which I bestowed upon you and  
[1:15:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4511) your mother how I strengthen you with  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4513) this holy spirit so you could speak from  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4515) your cradle and as a grown man  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4518) remember when I taught you the book The  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4520) Wisdom the Torah and the gospel remember  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4523) when with my permission you fasten  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4526) fashioned the shape of a bird out of  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4528) clay breathed into it and it became with  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4530) my permission a bird  
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4532) remember when with my permission you  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4534) healed a blind person and the leper when  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4537) by my permission you bought them dead  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4539) back to life remember when I kept the  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4542) children of Israel from harming you when  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4544) you came to them with all the evidence  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4546) of the truth and when those of them who  
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4548) are bent or denying the truth said this  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4550) is clearly nothing but deception okay  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4553) yes God with my best here  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4556) first of all the association say from in  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4558) the cradle and this grown man actually  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4563) is an old man like 60 and above  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4566) man  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4576) they saw they'll say hold on up to 15  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4579) years  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4581) and then it becomes sharp and then  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4584) becomes a man full man Etc and then a  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4588) man is a physical fiction of Ages 40 and  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4592) then it goes downhill and then God is  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4593) 50. so that's a hint  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4596) that  
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4598) either  
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4600) the usual narratives we have that that  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4603) he was ascending and so on and born in I  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4605) think that's the strongest point of view  
[1:16:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4607) that he was ascended to Heaven uh when  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4610) him was 33 years or 27 or something  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4612) that's most likely but that's refuted by  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4615) many evidence even in their scripture  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4616) and the associated literature it's  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4619) almost certainly the the  
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4622) birth of Christ is at least at least 10  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4626) 15 years before the the year zero so  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4630) it's not in the year zero  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4632) almost set the end of the year zero no  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4634) certainly we can say because if he was  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4637) ascended in 27 Andrew is 50 how much did  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4640) we have to add to that that's three  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4641) total 23 so maybe 20 years before 23 or  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4645) something like that and also there's a  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4646) hint actually thinking look when he said  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4649) he was talking about Abraham Ibrahim say  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4651) how can this guy talks as if he met  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4654) Abraham hmm  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4656) and he's he's not even 50 or he's 50.  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4659) that's the beginning of his message so  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4660) this again that's confirmed in a foot in  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4663) a in a side note this one a correction  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4666) and secondly  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4668) one of the features of of Lisa that he  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4672) has a special Grace on him and his  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4673) mother mother his mother is very special  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4675) and very very elected and he she's dealt  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4677) with in another Surah but he was  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4679) supported with the Holy Spirit  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4681) all prophets received the Holy Spirit as  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4683) a medium of of of  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4685) uh of communication with Allah this is  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4688) another name for jibril  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4691) although yeah I don't think if the  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4694) people were scriptural equate the Holy  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4696) Spirit or not they don't have they have  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4698) this concept but it's clear the Quran  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4701) clarified that the holy spirit is jibril  
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4703) he was the Holy Spirit was a joint to  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4707) him like like a permanent companion  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4710) which is not happening to any prophets  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4712) before even Muhammad Assam did not get  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4713) your viewers he has visited for him and  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4716) one time he asked Gabriel why don't you  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4718) visit us more than that and I can say oh  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4720) man we don't come down only with the  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4722) command of Our Lord we are not coming at  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4724) Liberty we come when we order we are all  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4727) the not to go we not come  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4729) but in the case of Israel he was like a  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4732) permanent companion although we have  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4733) some people before that a young man  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4736) called Toby I think Toby in the book I  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4737) don't think it's a book who was supposed  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4740) to have Rafael Islam as His companion  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4744) for some time on Earth  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4746) I didn't read the story of this but the  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4748) Intriguing story so this this could  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4751) could be even for someone who's like  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4752) tobia nobody here with Toby or tobia  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4754) Allah what is this man young man not  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4758) even a prophet maybe other Prophet I  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4759) should read that maybe maybe I  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4761) neglectedly that is I think it's in the  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4763) Apocrypha it's not in the in the main  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4764) Bible  
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4768) the medium of of Revelation as being  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4772) allocated to him like a companion so I  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4775) supported to his side supporting  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4777) continuously it's not the civilization  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4780) comes anything and one about that one  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4782) sign of this support is that he was able  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4784) to speak and then the Cradle uh this  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4787) needs really  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4788) militant with a physical Force  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4796) the writing scripture wisdom  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4800) and the Torah and the gospel Torah is  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4802) obviously the teaching which comes  
[1:20:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4803) essentially he was taught the the Torah  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4806) which was in the tablets not the five  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4809) books they call Torah by extension  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4811) because there's no guarantee that what  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4814) in their hand is really what it  
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4815) established or what have been given to  
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4817) Musa a special teaching he was aware  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4820) about that until the pure form  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4823) but unfortunately that was not recorded  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4825) or kept and so on because of the events  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4827) which are developed and then in June is  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4829) that that's the name that the word in  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4830) jail is actually  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4832) used for the Christianity as like a  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4834) bigger favor but here meant is it that a  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4837) very special Revelation to ISA and his  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4839) injunction their collection the  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4841) collection of their his sayings should  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4842) be the injeel should be the good news is  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4845) just and it's very well possible that it  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4848) even at that time the Jews were using  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4850) Evangelion or something like that from  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4852) Greek because they were in that Society  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4855) was for two centuries and very  
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4858) influenced by Greek culture and under  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4860) foreign  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4863) something like that as an adoption from  
[1:21:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4866) from the from the Greek language  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4869) although maybe he also he was able to  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4871) speak Greek we don't know definitely he  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4873) was speaking Aramaic  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4876) foreign  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4880) language of the people in Palestine  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4882) especially in North Palestine because  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4884) that Hebrew the the classical Hebrew was  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4888) really distinctive to The Scholar so  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4890) it's like fossa where the common  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4891) language or the Arabic  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4895) so I taught all of that  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4897) we don't need to be taught by anybody  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4899) else I taught you directly or maybe  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4901) through the Holy Spirit  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4902) and then now something civilizing come  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4905) which is not in the scripture except in  
[1:21:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4907) some popular  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4908) mentioned that as next one is  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4921) shape of a bed  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4924) with my permission I permitted you to do  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4926) that and then you blow in it  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4928) and then  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4930) it turned into a real bet  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4932) now there's nowhere in the comment for  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4936) scripture  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4938) which were the four gospels we have nor  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4941) in the writing of Paul but anyway Paul  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4944) is not reliable is just living in a  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4945) dream world he's talking about the  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4947) meeting Christ in the spirit and the  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4950) living  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4952) if he's lying or telling the truth in  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4954) another world not in the real world  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4956) completely almost completely the only  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4958) thing which and he mentioned barely  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4960) anything of the Life of Christ acceptor  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4962) so-called crucifixion and more than  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4963) Cruces the resurrection that's what they  
[1:22:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4966) concerned him nothing else and the  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4968) meaning of that and the meaning of the  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4970) sacrifice so he's completely in the  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4972) metaphysical any other details any other  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4975) stories of importance any Reviving of it  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4977) I don't think he mentioned even if I  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4979) think that that's he didn't but all  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4980) about that  
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4981) but the other  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4983) minor  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4985) scripture and so on and and Epistles and  
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4987) things like that they don't mention  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4989) except some Apocrypha claimed that he  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4991) was doing that with the with the shape  
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4993) of the bed when he was a child like  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4995) something like a child play  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4997) so all what remained in the memory of  
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=4999) the people is that that I said but here  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5002) it is mentioned ahead of the major  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5003) Miracles he was doing in the time of his  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5006) message  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5007) not as a child play so that that piece  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5010) of information was misplaced reported  
[1:23:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5013) back into his Youth and making azerbilic  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5016) like like and also the the these infancy  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5019) gospels various impossible  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5021) rejected by the right whistle because it  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5024) contains nonsensical things which nobody  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5026) can tolerated  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5028) uh the they mentioned this issue with  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5030) the bed but it's more like a plague not  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5032) not as an evidence for money soil so it  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5036) has been misplaced into his youth maybe  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5039) he done in his youth but in his youth  
[1:24:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5041) there's no all evidences that he was not  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5044) was living in a private life just  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5047) surprised he's a prophet but not a  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5048) messenger yet he is profit from his  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5050) birth because he said clearly  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5054) from the best that's not no doubt about  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5057) that but he was  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5059) not carrying any message yet I'm not  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5061) addressing anybody until the day he  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5063) started the message  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5065) we always start the message which is by  
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5067) by him as a mature man in his 40 most  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5070) likely not as the the funny story is  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5072) over 30 and so on and all these dancers  
[1:24:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5074) that's all nonsensical  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5076) that I testified with the white God  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5079) so what happened to that  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5082) obviously the the the  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5084) some Christians said oh he hit him he  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5087) took a trunk he got it from Apocrypha  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5089) that's all first will say this is not  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5090) that I'm a gospel so it can't be true uh  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5092) it's actually in some apocalypse he got  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5094) the trunk that is the usual way he  
[1:24:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5096) misplaced it okay fine  
[1:24:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5099) leave that aside see that or instead of  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5103) saying maybe we got a torso wrong if  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5105) that's a revelation then that's what  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5107) that book ever had they mentioned there  
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5108) but they put it in the wrong times three  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5110) huh  
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5112) that this is the moral well-balanced  
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5114) point of view is that for example the  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5115) so-called famous the famous Christmas  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5118) Story the best story in Bethlehem and so  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5120) on I think all recession I want all the  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5122) historic evidences and all  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5124) cross-referencing of the events at that  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5126) time which make any sense  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5129) shows that the whole story is fabricated  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5132) that that that they they they because  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5136) it's clear that all his life was in  
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5138) Galilee how come that he went to  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5140) Bethlehem ah because uh allegedly his  
[1:25:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5143) adoptive father it's not even his  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5145) physical father because he's supposed to  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5147) be a Son of God or supposed to be  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5149) without a human father okay was ordered  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5152) like all people with other than the  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5154) Caesar and the Roman to everyone to go  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5156) to his original City for taxation  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5162) about the money you registered in the  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5165) place we are living  
[1:26:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5167) nobody in his right mind basically the  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5169) Roman Empire who is not for very  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5172) exacting and streamlined Administration  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5175) that's the name of their Mastery their  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5176) Master organization the Greek word  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5178) master of philosophy and thoughts and  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5180) music and things not only the master of  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5182) parable and strong Administration they  
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5184) will not let up or hold by the people  
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5186) going across Palestine back and forth  
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5188) clouding the streets so to go through  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5190) their own ancestor cities this is  
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5193) completely nonsensical nobody believes  
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5195) distances but that's what what the story  
[1:26:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5197) you find in the gospel  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5200) so that he is descending from David but  
[1:26:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5203) this is he said the alleged descending  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5206) they will throw his adopting father is  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5208) irrelevant because this is only the  
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5210) adopted father so he's not the center of  
[1:26:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5211) Labor and oh there's no clear evidence  
[1:26:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5214) that his mother is going to descending  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5216) from David most likely she's a she's  
[1:26:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5218) from Ireland  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5219) so  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5221) so if you got it so that's much more for  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5224) such a fundamental point a new point of  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5225) view that is the Messiah because of the  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5227) one coming from the seed of David and  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5229) them inside the king Messiah then you  
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5231) got that completely wrong and this can  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5234) be easily refuted that's the one of the  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5236) things which has to be refuted nobody of  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5238) this series in scholarship accept that  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5240) the story of Christmas Story  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5244) so you are getting things much more  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5246) longer than that so why is not the also  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5248) this that you got a drunk and as you had  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5251) missed in this scripture why it is  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5252) missed we don't know meaning that the  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5254) the current there's a for for gospels  
[1:27:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5256) you have in hand they have considerable  
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5259) deficiency and shortcomings  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5263) and although this miracle is actually  
[1:27:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5265) maybe number one because turning  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5268) something out of mud into a bird  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5271) is much more miraculous and persuasive  
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5273) than than uh healing uh the the leper  
[1:27:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5278) and the bride  
[1:28:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5282) but someone said okay but healing there  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5284) but that seems to be uh light is more  
[1:28:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5287) mentioned ahead of of uh of Reviving The  
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5291) Dead  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5292) the reason for that is that  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5294) the the blind from birth  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5297) healing him is actually more miraculous  
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5301) than the the Reviving the dead because  
[1:28:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5307) blind from from childhood will have like  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5311) the latest Akama we have in history with  
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5314) the Disappeared in the in the 30s of the  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5317) last century because after that the  
[1:28:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5319) surgery was developed and which a child  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5321) is recognized to have this problem he  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5323) can have the surgery and he can see  
[1:28:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5327) that the one who's coming very fast by  
[1:28:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5329) surgery there are others which notes  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5330) because there's a damage in the eye of  
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5331) the elephants there was no hope then you  
[1:28:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5333) will believe by this life  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5334) but the problem with that  
[1:28:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5336) now the level is okay leave the level  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5338) aside but the problem with with the with  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5341) the Akama is that  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5344) if you don't have sight from birth  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5347) then you have no concept about about the  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5350) vision light  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5352) the word you know the word they can't  
[1:29:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5354) tell you that things look like these  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5356) various colors but you have no concept  
[1:29:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5357) of them in your mind  
[1:29:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5359) and you have no concept how to you know  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5361) how to go straight and touch the walls  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5364) and so on but if you become seeing you  
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5367) see things you should make no sense out  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5368) of it because you haven't experience  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5369) with them before  
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5371) but those Akbar when they become seeing  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5375) they run away directly home so they were  
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5378) able to find their way without a stick  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5381) so as if all these accumulated  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5382) accumulated information without seeing  
[1:29:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5385) accumulating over their life until until  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5386) they reach the age of that one who has  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5388) been just now healed as if it is all  
[1:29:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5390) that were gone back and loaded in their  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5392) brain  
[1:29:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5393) and I would say this is more difficult  
[1:29:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5395) to imagine and perceive than in  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5398) verifying up dead after 10 days  
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5402) because only just reverse the biological  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5404) processes and remove the toxins and so  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5406) on or recreate the cells and so on  
[1:30:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5409) and the the brain with all the previous  
[1:30:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5411) members should should be it seems to be  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5414) less less demanding and requiring  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5416) entropy and and energy input than the  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5420) other one seems to be but also the level  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5422) most likely the level of this wavelry  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5424) Pelosi had been expelled outside of the  
[1:30:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5427) citizens on the time past that the only  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5428) way they were dealing with them was very  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5430) Advanced usually the Republic is going  
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5432) deep also in is not only the noses being  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5435) fallen and and the face is mutilated no  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5437) no it's going deep even the harder and  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5439) then and then in the muscles and so on  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5441) leading to death  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5443) so erasing all of that and the creating  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5446) that is as as is maybe like like  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5448) Reviving a date or even more because in  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5450) certain organs only not the whole body  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5453) so this seems to be more miraculous and  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5456) the one I'm just marketing to bed is  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5458) even more miraculous  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5460) yeah but is that relevant anyway it's a  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5462) very important miracle and it's not in  
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5464) the existing so-called non-apocrifa  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5467) but the other ones is there  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5470) so what is all the premises  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5475) so uh and to remove any or it looks  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5478) pretty because it is but in this  
[1:31:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5479) situation it's important to stress that  
[1:31:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5481) that nobody think this is by any any  
[1:31:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5483) intrinsic part of a size or by about he  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5486) has a power he's given the power and you  
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5487) can use it at Liberty but with the  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5490) Divine permission both legislatively and  
[1:31:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5492) creatively with Allah's permission  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5496) and then I put access to you from the  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5498) plotting of money for the children of  
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5500) Israel when when uh you got them with  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5504) the evidences including these are all  
[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5506) these Bunch tons of evidences under this  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5508) video of them who were bent to deny the  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5511) truth they said this is evident through  
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5513) scaff this is this is this is a  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5516) we have been we have been imagining  
[1:31:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5518) things that's not happening this is a  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5520) hologram if we're living in modern I say  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5523) oh this is the origami he's making a  
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5524) projection nothing is happening there  
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5526) it's just a program that's only a  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5528) hologram that's it that's it nothing you  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5531) fooled our eye nothing that is real  
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5533) although it's clearly real in front of  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5535) the rights  
[1:32:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5536) there's nothing that is real  
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5539) so remember he said all these famous  
[1:32:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5541) that's all Prelude to discuss him and  
[1:32:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5543) what has the people claiming that he  
[1:32:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5545) said  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5546) so  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5552) so remember that Teresa  
[1:32:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5557) and remember  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5560) whether it will come to also a critical  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5562) point without hurting  
[1:32:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5567) Muslim  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5569) yeah  
[1:32:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5570) and remember the time when I inspired  
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5572) the white garbed ones believe in me and  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5575) my Apostle they answered we believe and  
[1:32:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5577) bear that witness that that we have  
[1:33:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5580) surrendered ourselves unto thee the  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5583) translation and mentioned when I  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5585) inspired the disciple to be the  
[1:33:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5587) disciples to believe in me and my  
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5588) messenger they answered we believe and  
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5591) we're witnessed that we submit ourselves  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5593) to you  
[1:33:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5595) yeah I think not nothing tricks I just  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5596) remember that because  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5599) it's it's Allah inspired them and almost  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5603) gifted them the faith because they were  
[1:33:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5606) the the disciples if you if you see that  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5609) this was mentioned in the uh in the  
[1:33:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5611) current books the four on the others  
[1:33:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5614) they are actually from the most simple  
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5617) uh classes of the society fishermen and  
[1:33:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5620) some very simple people  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5621) not capable of a real communication with  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5625) this very sophisticated it's extremely  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5627) sophisticated man he has from childhood  
[1:33:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5629) been educated about the scripture about  
[1:33:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5631) wisdom and possibly he maybe have been  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5633) educated about the philosophy and so on  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5635) we don't know but definitely all of this  
[1:33:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5638) all the knowledge of his time he was  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5639) mastering it is the extreme opposite to  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5642) Muhammad was completed later barely  
[1:34:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5645) having anything completely opposite and  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5647) these simple people  
[1:34:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5649) were taken over by by like by surprise  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5652) Allah Inspire them they are simple they  
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5654) are willing they are like like a like a  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5657) tabular rather like nothing is written  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5659) they are very simple not something  
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5660) because it's sophisticated one are  
[1:34:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5662) usually a problem they will come with  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5664) counter question with like the Jews this  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5666) is witchcraft this is hologram in modern  
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5668) times say oh this was a hologram the man  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5670) was mastering calligraphy at that time  
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5671) ahead of his time all of his or he  
[1:34:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5674) communicating with the Extraterrestrial  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5675) they'll come with all these nonsense no  
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5678) nowadays they may come with something  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5679) like that but this is my simple problem  
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5681) and Allah inspired them believe in me  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5684) and see and they believed so they so is  
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5687) is is is is the  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5690) is is like a Divine Divine Light given  
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5694) to them Exile and other people and this  
[1:34:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5696) has the effect and they accepted it  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5698) because of their pure heartedness and  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5700) simpleness  
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5701) and then  
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5702) they became believer and they assemble  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5704) of resembleness and a symbol  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5706) symbol-mindedness and symbol-heartedness  
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5708) express them in the next one and also in  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5711) all life and how how Paul uh almost uh  
[1:35:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5715) let's say draw circles along with them  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5716) and play them later but this is  
[1:35:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5718) discussing illegal Insanity was not the  
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5720) job now but let's say the next one which  
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5723) is a really a very difficult point to to  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5726) synchronize with the existing  
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5728) description they have without  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5730) meaning  
[1:35:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5740) and lo the white card once said oh Jesus  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5743) on a Mary could I sustain a send out  
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5745) unto us a recast from a heaven Jesus  
[1:35:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5749) asked to be conscious of God if you are  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5752) truly Believers let's translation  
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5755) I mentioned when the Believers when the  
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5758) disciples said Jesus Son of Mary can you  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5760) can your lord send us a feast from  
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5762) Heaven Jesus answered remain mindful of  
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5765) God if you are truly believers  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5767) yeah uh that's the the Texas Kitty let's  
[1:36:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5770) show the the honesty assembled minded  
[1:36:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5772) this value because if you are a Believer  
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5775) and you have seen all these Miracles so  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5776) what's what's having a feast from heaven  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5780) from the window some some table comes at  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5782) a table of four legs they have a table  
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5784) and some like spread come down with the  
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5786) with the with the with food on it or  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5790) with one special meal of it and so on  
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5793) it's not nothing much more exciting than  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5796) the previous ones so it is yeah so but  
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5801) they wanted most likely they wanted  
[1:36:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5802) something private for them private  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5804) medical I was stressed I was Private  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5806) because something later May hint that it  
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5808) is of this type  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5809) and data was obviously shocking this  
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5811) kind of a simple-minded that really  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5813) relatively shocking request from from  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5816) Believers should not be  
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5820) aware of a life you're a True Believer  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5823) and they responded  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5834) sad day we decided to partake thereof so  
[1:37:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5836) that our site our hearts might be set  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5840) fully at rest and that we might know  
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5841) that thou has spoken the truth to us and  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5844) that we might be of those who bear  
[1:37:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5845) witness thereto the exploration they  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5848) said we wish to eat from it so that our  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5850) hearts might be as reassured and that we  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5853) might know that you have told us the  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5856) truth and be among those who witness it  
[1:37:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5857) so basically there when something which  
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5860) is private and they can't experience it  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5862) by not only just by seeing because all  
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5864) these other Americans you see but you  
[1:37:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5866) don't have the Intel in in ingestive  
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5870) experience that  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5874) for example none of these birds flew  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5876) away none of them came back and they  
[1:37:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5877) could Slaughter and eat for example  
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5879) something like that that's really a bed  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5881) not a hologram but this one and you see  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5884) the tablespoed coming down or the food  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5886) or the maybe just a big plate and uh  
[1:38:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5891) and the issue is that it comes from  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5893) Heaven not that the content is heaven  
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5894) you know this is not about any content  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5896) that's not an issue but just that you  
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5897) can eat from it  
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5900) digest it gets it in the ability and  
[1:38:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5902) feel really that yourself so this feels  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5904) more persuasive and more more convincing  
[1:38:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5907) that it's real  
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5908) that is an art house would be completely  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5911) at rest because obviously what is the  
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5912) money Israel claiming this is a  
[1:38:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5914) witchcraft is a magician this is done by  
[1:38:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5916) this wizard this is done by this one  
[1:38:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5918) this is the until a time of Visa there's  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5920) some wizard claiming to do Miracles like  
[1:38:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5921) him and things like that and and they  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5924) were able also to to play certain tricks  
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5926) with the people and although Mass  
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5927) hypnosis and things like that so they  
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5929) were if you read the the scripture under  
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5932) the epistle at that time and the various  
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5934) historic reports that you will be amazed  
[1:38:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5936) how how many people going around and  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5937) doing Mischief with these things so  
[1:39:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5940) maybe then excludes for them but they  
[1:39:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5942) wanted this private one  
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5944) then we know that you are telling the  
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5946) truth just affirm it they know it but as  
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5949) you want a double affirmation  
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5951) and it will be witnessed for that  
[1:39:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5954) then either based on that circuits  
[1:39:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5968) the son of Mary oh Gods our sustainers  
[1:39:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5971) sent down upon us a report from Heaven  
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5973) it shall be an Ever occurring faith for  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5976) us for the first time and the for the  
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5978) first and the last of us and a sign from  
[1:39:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5981) thee o provide our us our sustenance for  
[1:39:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5985) thou art the best providers yeah  
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5988) the son of Mary said God our Lord send  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5992) us a meal from Heaven that we can have a  
[1:39:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5994) recurring celebration for the first and  
[1:39:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5997) the last of us and a sign from you  
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=5999) provide for us because you are the best  
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6001) of providers yeah so you'll notice this  
[1:40:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6004) is  
[1:40:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6005) repeating that again again to enforce it  
[1:40:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6007) it should have been easy just Elizabeth  
[1:40:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6010) but also it has to remember how many  
[1:40:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6012) many times Mariam appears in the Quran I  
[1:40:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6015) will have to check that it has any  
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6017) significance maybe it has some medical  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6019) significance also anyway that's not the  
[1:40:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6021) major issue now  
[1:40:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6023) is a supplicated  
[1:40:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6024) but he has to make this application so  
[1:40:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6026) that it is that it looks reasonable and  
[1:40:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6029) rational  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6030) and that's a uh that he cannot do that  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6033) it's not in his authority to bring  
[1:40:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6034) something from Heaven down or lift  
[1:40:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6036) someone in heaven and in Earth he can't  
[1:40:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6038) he can revive this but not this type so  
[1:40:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6041) send us down a table thread or a meal  
[1:40:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6043) from heaven  
[1:40:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6045) so that they say is intending it to be  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6048) that's what the intending but is it so  
[1:40:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6049) that's a question that it will be a  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6052) celebration for us from now and on until  
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6055) the last of us  
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6056) and the sign from you both is but so it  
[1:40:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6058) will be like a read day so this will  
[1:41:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6060) establish a new hit beside the age of  
[1:41:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6063) the Old Testament they were similarating  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6064) anyway  
[1:41:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6065) and give us for music because you are  
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6068) the best officer what best of us  
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6075) and the issues of that there's no threes  
[1:41:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6078) in the current scripture about that  
[1:41:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6080) Allah  
[1:41:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6084) foreign  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6094) I always do send it down upon to you and  
[1:41:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6098) so if any of you should henceforth deny  
[1:41:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6101) this truth on him behold will I inflict  
[1:41:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6105) The Suffering The Life of which I have  
[1:41:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6107) never yet inflicted upon anyone in this  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6109) world in the world this is a key point  
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6112) so  
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6118) it is such a saturated such a binding uh  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6125) miracle for them that whoever  
[1:42:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6128) from these disciples were asking which  
[1:42:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6130) maybe that's wealth we don't know maybe  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6133) more than that they were asking because  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6135) he has 12 he had 70 had other people  
[1:42:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6137) maybe they were president maybe we don't  
[1:42:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6139) know most likely it's only the 12th  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6142) foreign  
[1:42:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6148) just for the number because they weren't  
[1:42:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6150) were not from the 12th shop they formed  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6152) by two maybe three traps anyway  
[1:42:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6155) but whoever denied the truth after that  
[1:42:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6157) I will punish him more severely than  
[1:42:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6159) anyone in the universe  
[1:42:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6162) [Music]  
[1:42:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6166) then I will punish him more than anyone  
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6168) in the universe  
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6170) now  
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6172) this may be the key for solution for  
[1:42:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6174) that that there is no evidence that  
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6177) there's uh that that it is a spread from  
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6180) Heaven came what we have is also called  
[1:43:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6181) the last meal  
[1:43:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6183) which is obviously I eat the last meal  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6185) which is at the same time time wise is  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6189) synchronous with with the Easter yeah  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6192) because that that last meal was uh was  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6195) uh a couple day of the Easter day or I  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6198) think it was a Wednesday or something  
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6200) and yesterday was I think Friday and  
[1:43:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6202) with the alleged constriction has  
[1:43:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6204) happened  
[1:43:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6207) now the scholars of Islam  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6210) discussed that that there's nothing in  
[1:43:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6211) the scripture in the hand of the people  
[1:43:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6214) for any mission of this whatsoever  
[1:43:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6220) and they tried various Solutions  
[1:43:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6223) it's very difficult to assume that it  
[1:43:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6225) has happened like that  
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6228) and  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6230) it is not narrated anywhere does not  
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6232) become a festivity so they assume it may  
[1:43:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6234) be that table that that last meal is  
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6237) that table but in the story of the last  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6239) meal there's no mention of anything  
[1:44:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6241) coming from heaven  
[1:44:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6245) so how to resolve this problem  
[1:44:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6249) some of the one one of the better  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6251) Solutions said this is  
[1:44:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6256) when they hit  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6257) that's not about solution because when  
[1:44:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6259) they hear that it is it's not Allah it's  
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6261) not responding that it will be read and  
[1:44:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6263) so on no it's free it's not going to be  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6264) that so I'll be going obviously going to  
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6267) be an an enormous punishment for anyone  
[1:44:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6269) who didn't have to like that that's not  
[1:44:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6271) relevant you can't adopt it that's it if  
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6273) you want but that's that's it so it's a  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6276) private medical for you and anyone  
[1:44:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6278) deviating will be  
[1:44:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6280) they really punished on anyone in the  
[1:44:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6282) whole creation  
[1:44:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6283) and then respond understand  
[1:44:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6285) we believe without it we don't know and  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6288) Allah canceled it didn't come down  
[1:44:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6289) that's one Theory  
[1:44:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6292) another theory which is I would say is  
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6295) it's also maybe less persuasive than  
[1:44:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6297) this is that  
[1:45:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6301) it's a private it definitely Supply with  
[1:45:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6302) America because for only the disciples  
[1:45:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6304) nobody is present nobody is witnessing  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6309) it came down  
[1:45:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6311) with the threat and they knew about the  
[1:45:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6313) threat and Lisa told them  
[1:45:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6318) one that is mentioned in in their  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6320) existing gospel after the meal he told  
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6323) them during the meal after the meal some  
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6325) of you will betray me and some of you  
[1:45:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6327) will even deny me and most of you all of  
[1:45:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6331) you will run away from me when the the  
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6334) extension the detention the ransacking  
[1:45:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6337) group comes  
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6338) investigated by the temple but also with  
[1:45:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6341) the cooperation of the Romans because  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6342) they came in a cohort almost like a  
[1:45:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6344) regiment vegetarianism  
[1:45:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6346) and the old enough is clear that all the  
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6349) displays run away  
[1:45:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6350) and even some of the Departed Jerusalem  
[1:45:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6353) going back to Galilee and this allegedly  
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6356) uh Shimon such a moon  
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6359) Peter was called Peter in in Latin The  
[1:46:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6361) Rock  
[1:46:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6363) for the story  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6364) or not in the in the New Testament uh  
[1:46:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6368) sneaked and tried to look at the trial  
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6370) for the person who appears to be Aisa we  
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6372) discussed that in another occasion about  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6374) the so-called Transfiguration and and a  
[1:46:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6379) woman recognizing with ah this is the  
[1:46:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6380) one with the Galilean in that time is  
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6382) terrorist there's a Galilean like today  
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6385) as a Palestinian is one of the galileans  
[1:46:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6389) at the time against the Roman Empire and  
[1:46:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6391) he said no no I'm not anymore I don't  
[1:46:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6393) know this man whatsoever Angel run away  
[1:46:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6396) and against next again and several times  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6398) that's the story  
[1:46:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6403) and that will happen  
[1:46:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6405) so  
[1:46:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6407) I know that you understood denial you  
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6409) will be in a stage showcule you will  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6410) fail that but one of you would be above  
[1:46:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6412) cover that's that that's you that's  
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6414) that's the one that would be the story  
[1:46:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6415) believe in the punishment but if you  
[1:46:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6417) report he may even told him if you  
[1:47:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6420) report the story to the people they will  
[1:47:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6422) they will accuse you of committing cover  
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6424) and nobody will listen to you so don't  
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6426) keep that for yourself that's a very  
[1:47:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6428) good possibility I would I would say  
[1:47:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6430) this is not not a bad solution for the  
[1:47:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6434) for the fact that it is may have come  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6436) but they they were instructed don't tell  
[1:47:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6439) anybody because the way you behave in  
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6441) this night when the attack comes if  
[1:47:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6444) everyone will hold that against you and  
[1:47:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6446) you will be bad-mouthed and nobody will  
[1:47:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6448) will even accept anything from you or  
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6450) trust you but I know this is because  
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6452) your human weakness at this not because  
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6454) of cover  
[1:47:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6455) except one of you no one hopes betray me  
[1:47:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6458) the rest will will just and the shock  
[1:47:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6460) and the fear they will run away which  
[1:47:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6462) happens weakness but not cover  
[1:47:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6465) but don't mention that so don't stretch  
[1:47:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6467) anybody you have just final meal that's  
[1:47:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6469) it where the meal came from from heaven  
[1:47:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6471) from Market  
[1:47:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6473) from the shop next Saturday from from  
[1:47:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6475) her  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6477) eat it at the time there was no eat that  
[1:47:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6479) you can order by phone  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6481) just a meal don't mention that others  
[1:48:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6485) would lead to complete scandalization  
[1:48:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6487) I'll be discrediting you completely  
[1:48:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6489) is enough that you would not be able to  
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6491) sustain the shock so no need to mention  
[1:48:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6493) that story as I would say this is a  
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6495) reasonable possibility a third one which  
[1:48:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6498) is as I said minor is actually not the  
[1:48:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6499) last meal which became a festivity it's  
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6502) an event which happened earlier  
[1:48:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6506) but they did not recognize that it is  
[1:48:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6509) that what is that what that's the spirit  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6511) but it's very unlikely the way it's  
[1:48:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6513) reporting is very a little it may be the  
[1:48:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6515) the the this this this the the this  
[1:48:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6520) event is when we when he made a win  
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6523) increased the fish Etc so the the and  
[1:48:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6526) then then increase the food for a few  
[1:48:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6529) fishes a few few fish one or two fish  
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6531) which is sufficient for five ten men  
[1:48:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6533) were sufficient for three thousand  
[1:48:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6534) people  
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6535) that the the increases can the these  
[1:48:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6538) these new fish had come from heaven and  
[1:49:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6540) they were they were and the people  
[1:49:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6542) failed to record that like that and  
[1:49:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6543) failed to record it in detail how it  
[1:49:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6545) were whatever there was a request of the  
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6547) disability and things like that and it's  
[1:49:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6549) very well possible because we have that  
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6550) we have previously just mentioned the  
[1:49:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6552) fading to record but probably to record  
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6554) the the miracle obtaining uh  
[1:49:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6558) uh Birds into into a bed repair shapes  
[1:49:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6562) and mud shaped as Bears in real beds so  
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6565) it could be that but I would say this is  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6567) not very persuasive I would just one of  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6569) the two first ones are the most  
[1:49:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6570) persuasive one and the second one is  
[1:49:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6572) that it did come  
[1:49:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6575) and then he told them  
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6577) there you will you will know because  
[1:49:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6578) that after that in the current year the  
[1:49:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6581) documentary on our hand is clearly  
[1:49:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6583) mentioned that uh he he said that one of  
[1:49:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6586) you will betray me and you do you love  
[1:49:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6589) me with Peter uh  
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6591) let me say yes I love you also but you  
[1:49:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6593) will deny me three times that's there so  
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6596) better for you don't mention that to  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6598) anybody  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6600) don't inform the people I would tell  
[1:50:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6601) about it and otherwise it would be held  
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6605) against you and they will not be able to  
[1:50:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6606) call the people for for almost like you  
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6609) told them I would be saved I would I  
[1:50:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6611) will nothing will happen to me but  
[1:50:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6612) anyway Allah will step in and do do  
[1:50:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6615) whatever necessary but for you to be  
[1:50:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6617) scandalizing that's a possibility  
[1:50:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6618) whatever has happened  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6623) in many places doesn't give us the  
[1:50:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6625) except part of the story which of  
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6627) relevance obviously the known videos  
[1:50:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6632) but this is I would say this is actually  
[1:50:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6635) I'm not going to defeat yourself because  
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6637) if if he the if the story of the last  
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6641) meal is as in the character description  
[1:50:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6643) everywhere even the Apocrypha is the  
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6645) same message like that I know who it is  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6648) Came From Heaven  
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6650) then why should he invent such a story  
[1:50:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6653) get himself in trouble  
[1:50:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6656) there's nothing really any persuasive  
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6659) nothing beneficial in that like we  
[1:51:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6661) discussed in the case of of Suleiman the  
[1:51:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6665) majority of the Jews are most consensus  
[1:51:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6666) to the Jews is that Suleman is a  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6668) magician and then died as a cafe and  
[1:51:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6670) Idol worshiper so why he goes into  
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6672) trouble and the user exercise look at  
[1:51:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6674) this man he claims to the man is a  
[1:51:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6676) prophet actually he was a magician at a  
[1:51:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6677) catheter and Idol worshiper  
[1:51:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6679) why he should get it what was the  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6682) purpose of getting my own  
[1:51:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6683) self-interrupted if he has a if you  
[1:51:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6685) adopted the story somewhere  
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6688) so this is it needs an installation this  
[1:51:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6691) that's explanation that he got it wrong  
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6692) the same next station the Mariam there's  
[1:51:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6694) Mariam although in their Apocrypha not  
[1:51:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6696) in the main books in the mailbox has her  
[1:51:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6699) journalism  
[1:51:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6701) she's a suppository the daughter of a  
[1:51:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6704) man called Joachim  
[1:51:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6706) no time run  
[1:51:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6708) and they said oh yeah he got to talk he  
[1:51:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6710) said foreign  
[1:51:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6715) 1500 years drunk all these attempts of  
[1:51:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6718) of so-called resolution let's just make  
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6722) the one who claimed them to become a  
[1:52:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6723) joker this is not this is not a way to  
[1:52:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6726) go you have to bring a better  
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6727) acceleration I would say this  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6730) this Revelation clarified that until if  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6733) I historic things which are even  
[1:52:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6734) shocking that with what we have  
[1:52:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6736) literation our hand is having major  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6737) deficiency like the missing of the  
[1:52:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6739) missing of the the that missing here is  
[1:52:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6742) is understandable is it may be by  
[1:52:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6743) instructional visa and or there even  
[1:52:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6746) without instruction they decided if we  
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6748) say that it has come from heaven and  
[1:52:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6749) that's what Allah told us it will be  
[1:52:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6751) catastrophic just hide it the same for  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6753) example by after he reappeared the what  
[1:52:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6756) they call this election  
[1:52:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6757) is that they knew he was not crucified  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6759) but they did not they decided they've  
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6762) returned the people that he was not  
[1:52:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6763) crucified this will not have the effect  
[1:52:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6766) for that one as as uh  
[1:52:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6769) as as uh rebuking them because the first  
[1:52:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6774) sermon of Peter allegedly in the actual  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6776) Apostle says clearly to the people you  
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6778) killed a great prophet of God  
[1:53:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6781) and you have invited trouble for the  
[1:53:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6783) nation destruction and that people were  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6785) very repenting and they were weeping and  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6787) thousands embraced belief almost  
[1:53:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6789) immediately so using it that you killed  
[1:53:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6792) that one you are the guilty one using a  
[1:53:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6794) guilt feeling has a considerable effect  
[1:53:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6796) on spreading Christianity early  
[1:53:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6801) I don't know say I was distracted  
[1:53:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6802) administrator that you killed him  
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6804) which is which is a a good way to access  
[1:53:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6807) you intended to kill him you think you  
[1:53:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6809) have killed him that's fine but  
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6811) I wouldn't say I call that Ally Accord  
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6814) is it like a similar literary expression  
[1:53:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6818) you intended to look at him and some  
[1:53:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6820) things that's what appeared as a  
[1:53:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6822) crucifixion you you think and you are  
[1:53:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6823) convinced that some of them are good  
[1:53:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6825) you're gloating that you killed him but  
[1:53:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6826) with this way you you you got yourself  
[1:53:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6829) in a massive sin and then invited  
[1:53:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6832) Destruction for your own people as he  
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6833) announced that your temple will be  
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6835) destroyed and you will be scattered all  
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6837) over the world yeah that's what you're  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6838) getting so the people were very panicked  
[1:54:00](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6840) so it was very effective so it's very  
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6842) well possible that they knew that it was  
[1:54:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6844) not not a resurrection it was a  
[1:54:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6846) reappearance and the crucified was  
[1:54:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6848) someone else  
[1:54:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6849) very well password I'm not saying this  
[1:54:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6851) is a conclusion so many things there  
[1:54:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6854) besides obviously in in the existing  
[1:54:16](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6856) even the most reliable ones that's the  
[1:54:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6859) four ones now the four ones the the the  
[1:54:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6861) four Gospels  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6864) have been chosen to be the the cleanest  
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6866) and the the closest to history as they  
[1:54:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6869) could the scholars could in the fourth  
[1:54:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6871) Century the in the near the the choice  
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6873) was done in the in the near Kian and you  
[1:54:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6876) see a Nikki and Conference  
[1:54:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6878) some people say it is chosen because of  
[1:54:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6881) the correlation of the churches but this  
[1:54:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6883) is this is not persuasive yes the main  
[1:54:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6885) churches have their own main gospels but  
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6887) these have been chosen over time  
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6889) based on the best narrative the best  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6891) cross-referencing and so on there's some  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6893) questions good scholar they were going  
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6895) on that if you analyze them you see  
[1:54:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6897) really converter Apocrypha you see  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6899) clearly that these are the greatest and  
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6902) the best but they have my considerable  
[1:55:04](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6904) deficiencies and they still have  
[1:55:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6905) considerable publication here and there  
[1:55:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6908) Like A Christmas Story which is almost  
[1:55:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6911) 100 percent with all compounded evidence  
[1:55:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6915) is a fabrication you can't be true it's  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6917) just an initial room where someone  
[1:55:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6918) invented and then it was even even look  
[1:55:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6921) who seems to be the best historian could  
[1:55:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6924) not could not uh run away from that  
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6927) story and were perceived it to be true  
[1:55:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6929) and was fooled by this narrative  
[1:55:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6932) so that's that maybe but as I said this  
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6935) is  
[1:55:36](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6936) and then on the other hand it keeps an  
[1:55:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6939) open door for for federal recession  
[1:55:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6941) history so it keeps things dark so that  
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6943) people can do some research  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6945) the same like for example the story in  
[1:55:47](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6947) the case of talud  
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6949) who I mentioned that he was crossing the  
[1:55:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6951) river Alaska people not to think so this  
[1:55:53](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6953) story in the Old Testament is attributed  
[1:55:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6954) to Jerome Gideon the people when whose  
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6957) name the people put Bibles in the hotels  
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6959) and so on Gideon so  
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6962) it seems a bit has taken away from talud  
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6965) by obviously David and Davidian and  
[1:56:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6967) Solomon party  
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6969) and referred back to they couldn't  
[1:56:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6972) attribute such such a virtue of total  
[1:56:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6975) route  
[1:56:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6977) um  
[1:56:18](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6978) uh salt they couldn't so they attribute  
[1:56:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6980) to someone else so they transfer story  
[1:56:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6982) from birthstone to another person  
[1:56:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6983) because of the political orientation  
[1:56:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6985) because of a certain partisanship and  
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6988) things like that  
[1:56:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6989) it's very possible that it could happen  
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6991) for this things like that so that's why  
[1:56:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6994) in the Old Testament but the same could  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=6997) happen to elsewhere also for various  
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7000) reasons  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7002) but some good research should be can be  
[1:56:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7005) done there for the people who are  
[1:56:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7006) familiar with the with the New Testament  
[1:56:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7008) so on  
[1:56:52](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7012) just let me conclude because uh we'll uh  
[1:56:57](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7017) then the other discussion about that did  
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7019) you tell them that you are Divine and so  
[1:57:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7021) on that's what we will do next time I  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7023) just want to mention maybe  
[1:57:06](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7026) um  
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7027) or just leave it and leave it to the  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7029) next time Michelle that's okay because  
[1:57:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7031) it belongs more to the issue of divinity  
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7032) and things like that and divine natural  
[1:57:15](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7035) base at all so we stop here so that  
[1:57:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7037) issue of the matter is definitely a  
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7039) difficult one but it's difficult one  
[1:57:21](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7041) more for the other side than for us  
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7044) because they have we have manifestly  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7047) proven uh claims there which manifest  
[1:57:30](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7050) fabrication uh for example the story  
[1:57:33](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7053) that the conserviction has happened and  
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7054) then uh the the world of the temple or  
[1:57:38](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7058) had a crack and then the dead were  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7061) resurrected from their graves and walked  
[1:57:44](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7064) into Jerusalem hundreds of them  
[1:57:46](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7066) and nobody in where the history anywhere  
[1:57:48](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7068) neither Roman none of Roman non-jews  
[1:57:50](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7070) whatever they put anything like that  
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7071) it's just here just just smacks for  
[1:57:54](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7074) complete fabrication nonsenseica it  
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7076) can't be accepted such an event like  
[1:57:59](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7079) that cannot be possibly have happened  
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7081) without nobody in the world recording  
[1:58:03](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7083) and only just Matthew not even in Luke  
[1:58:05](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7085) not even anywhere else that's just upset  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7088) for example but anyway that's  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7091) there's still a matter of considerable  
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7093) research  
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7094) okay but we stop here in which I always  
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7097) before the Allah asking uh he said if he  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7100) has declared himself to be divine and  
[1:58:22](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7102) his mother yeah  
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7103) so just a question um so  
[1:58:25](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7105) ending  
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7109) so that's the last one we did yeah and  
[1:58:32](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7112) the next one will be starting  
[1:58:35](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7115) um  
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7117) did you tell the people to adopt me or  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7119) to appoint me and my mother divine  
[1:58:45](https://youtu.be/d1OyGujhKgU?t=7125) by this kind of
