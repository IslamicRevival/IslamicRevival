 Tafseer-ul-Quran - Almassari - 014 - Al-Baqara - 08 - تفسير سورة البقرة discusses the difference between believing in Allah and being a believer. It explains that some people who embraced Islam did not immigrate, but stayed with their own people, and fought alongside the Muslims. When the Muslims were fighting against other tribes, some of these people became apostates, because they were not fully committed to the faith. However, even after they apostatized, they are still not believers, according to Allah's judgement. It is important to be aware of this distinction, in order to better understand all the issues surrounding the Quran.

If they are faced with a test, their allegiance will flip and they will fail the test.

* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=900)** The speaker provides a brief overview of the Islamic concept of "hassam," or "agility." The hassam of agile refers to a situation in which someone goes overboard in their dispute, breaking any sort of moral or legal boundaries. The speaker provides an example of this situation, involving a servant who didn't cook the food their master ordered. The speaker warns that such an extreme instance can lead to tragedy, as in the case of Abdullah, who killed his slave because of the dispute. The speaker advises those in a dispute to seek help from a trustworthy third party, instead of going overboard themselves.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=1200)** The speaker points out that there are four characteristics of a hypocrite, and that if they are present in a person, then the person is not a believer in the correct sense. He also points out that this is not an issue that can be easily solved, and that it is more complex than the issue of iman.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=1500)** The surah discusses the difference between believing in life, which is required for salvation, and believing in Allah, which is required for justice. The first category, of people who believe in life but not in Allah, are not believers. The second category, of people who believe in Allah but not in life, are also not believers. This second group is made up of those who are pretending to be Muslims, and those who are not actually Muslims but are allowing themselves to be led by their feelings instead of by their intellect.

He goes on to say that even if a person does repent, they may not be able to save themselves from eternal punishment if they don't continue to obey Allah.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=2400)** The speaker explains that some people try to rationalize away the existence of God by pointing to the many mistakes made by humans. The speaker cautions against being fooled by these people, noting that even a small child is wiser than most of these scientists and doctors.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=2700)** The speaker discusses the dangers of relying on reason alone to understand religious texts, and argues that people can be deceived by their own false understanding of religion. He goes on to say that successful deceivers often disguise themselves as believers in order to gain access to secret information, and that this can lead to disastrous consequences for the deceived.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=3000)** The speaker discusses how some people have deficient beliefs about Islam, which leads to them deceiving themselves. He goes on to say that true believers should have strong beliefs in Allah and be willing to face hardship in order to enter paradise.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5unWL0_bx4&t=3300)** The speaker discusses how he believes that people can fail the test of faith if they do not understand Allah correctly. He says that this deficiency is widespread in Christianity, and that it can lead to people being unlucky in life. He also mentions how one day his dog died, and how this incident made him realize that god does not exist.

[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=20) yeah we continue  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=22) with the the next group of eyes which  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=26) uh related all of them to the penis the  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=28) best thing is to read all of them in one  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=29) sec because  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=31) one of the problems of many books of  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=33) tips here  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=34) they do ayah by ayah and this seems to  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=37) be there's  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=38) there's tendency to forget about the  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=41) context  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=43) the eyes are related everyone agrees  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=44) that they are edited  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=46) so it says number eight until twenty so  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=48) it's our twelve eyes  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=56) uh  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=81) and see some of the translation  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=85) interestingly they have we did not i did  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=87) not address last time that  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=88) they have in the top beside the uh  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=91) transliteration how to pronounce it  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=94) with a certain convention if you know  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=95) the convention you will be able to  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=96) translate as close to arabic as possible  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=99) there's also a literal word by word but  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=101) obviously literal word by word you have  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=103) to sometimes insert like a sentence  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=105) between parentheses or a part of a  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=107) sentence  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=107) so that it streams doesn't become like  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=109) just just scattered words  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=111) makes sense for example the ayah number  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=113) eight here  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=114) he says and of the people you could say  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=117) and of mankind was  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=118) all the most of the people okay so nasty  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=120) translates usually  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=122) and of the people so even though is the  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=125) translator and  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=126) and of the people now open parenthesis  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=128) are some close balances  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=130) who say we believe in allah and the day  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=134) and the and the day the last day  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=137) that they last obviously their last is  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=140) not a  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=140) very very tasteful in english all just  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=142) seemed to be lexical shakespearean  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=144) english  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=145) the day last but then the last day  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=147) actually the day the last  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=150) but not they and parties  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=154) are believers so it's  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=157) actually the literal one is quite  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=159) reasonable it's quite good  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=161) in the sense uh because  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=164) it highlights things which are general  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=166) translations i know  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=167) more focus on the meaning may miss uh  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=170) for example let us see what  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=172) picture says and of mankind is you use  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=174) my kind of study of people that's good i  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=176) i would prefer that over people actually  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=178) because that's because  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=182) all mankind  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=186) nations and tribes is at the same  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=188) mankind so nazis better say as mankind  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=190) other than people so in the literal one  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=192) i would have said mankind  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=194) and are some who say we believe in allah  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=198) and the last day  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=199) okay that's good when they believe not  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=202) here it's actually the literal one is  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=204) better when they are not believe us  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=206) actually at all in parties at all  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=209) because he said muhammadin  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=211) so this gives straight nuances which the  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=214) literal one is here better  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=216) gives better mores and many other  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=217) translations are like that  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=220) some producer ali says they are not  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=223) believers he doesn't say they don't  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=224) believe not like like uh  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=226) uh so pictol went more into uh  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=230) into making the verb but actually it is  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=233) not aware because they are not  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=234) believable  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=235) and this is us through the subtle issues  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=237) of iman and kuffar we discussed that we  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=239) discussed the iman and cover  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=240) and we saw that the issue iman is quite  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=242) complex  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=244) and cover also we needed almost for iman  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=247) we needed several helicopters just just  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=249) to explore some of the aspects and cover  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=251) with the opposite of the iman  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=252) took apart  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=255) so these are complex issues  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=260) uh which are coming even more to force  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=263) here  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=264) because we are dealing now with the  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=266) category who says we usually called mon  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=268) afiqa  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=269) translated as hypocrite okay you could  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=273) say  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=273) this hypocrite all to that  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=277) although it doesn't use the word  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=280) anywhere in his eyes who don't need to  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=281) bother about whatever but  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=283) everyone agrees and when they go to any  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=285) of the quran taps here  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=287) they could speak about this these three  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=288) is about these twelve eyes about gravity  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=291) so the first four eyes are for a  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=295) believer of two types of believers  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=298) two eyes for the catherine uh because  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=301) the situation is clear and obvious  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=302) what's going on  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=303) and then for the monarchy because the  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=304) complexity of the issues i'm needing to  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=306) give examples  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=307) it goes over 12 uh over 12  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=311) highers not only because they are more  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=314) dangerous maybe than the caffeine  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=316) surely they are but because the nature  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=319) of in fact  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=320) quite complex and without taking all the  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=322) evidence in the rest of the quran  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=324) is almost impossible to recognize what's  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=326) going on what is the  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=327) fact one  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=330) one type of is clear to everyone which

[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=367) he's doing a drama is that he's a drama  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=370) guy  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=371) uh that's the time of the fact without  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=374) any doubt that's without  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=375) that's that's what comes in people's  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=377) mind most frequently  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=380) but there's another type which people  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=382) rarely under  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=383) recognize and which is maybe the more  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=386) dangerous one is that  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=388) someone may be declared a muslim and he  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=391) thinks of himself that he's a muslim  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=393) but his understanding of iman and islam  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=397) is so deficient  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=399) and his iman or his his commitment to  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=401) islam is  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=402) usually it comes not from technique not  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=404) from but holding islam withdrawn  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=408) but he is not willing to submit  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=411) and to as we said iman is not just  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=415) the the statement of the heart that's  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=418) what the mental  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=419) the mental image of what is true or  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=421) false  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=422) it is morals that actual acts of the  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=424) heart which is  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=425) must be uh at least having a minimum  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=428) level with what is the minimum level  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=429) exactly only allah knows what the  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=431) minimum level  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=432) of commitment to islam and submission to  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=436) to allah and the willingness to accept  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=438) allah subhanahu and  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=440) allegiance to allah that that allah is  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=442) the king and the sovereign and the  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=443) commander  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=445) this will contradict many people who for  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=448) example believe  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=450) that for example the queen is a  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=452) sovereign which has some kind of  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=454) sovereignty  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=455) but still he believes but he thought  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=458) that this does not contradict  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=459) he did not understand the meaning of yet  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=462) he did not think that this kind of  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=463) sovereignty contradict the meaning of  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=464) allah being this also  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=466) the issue of hakim that the rulership  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=468) that the ultimate rulership  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=469) which we will discuss obviously down the  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=471) road is disgusting  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=474) in the last edition which has been  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=476) translated  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=477) shows that is all about hakimiya not  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=481) about other issues creation the vessel  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=482) these are issues which are usually not  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=484) of dutch contentions  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=486) but suggestion who is the sovereign who  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=488) is what commands when we define good and  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=490) evil  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=492) they are not willing to submit that to  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=494) the level  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=497) because they would like to follow  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=498) certain desires for example they would  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=501) would like to be more devoted to their  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=503) nationalism or their tribalism and so on  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=505) so their allegiance and then and  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=507) connection to to the  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=508) to islam and the muslim ummah is just  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=511) some kind of  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=513) amorphous feeling not a structured  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=515) allegiance  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=516) that if it comes to a contradiction  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=518) between allegiance to  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=520) to allah this messenger to the islam and  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=522) to your nationality or your tribe or  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=524) your family  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=525) once you have to be born in front  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=529) and the other one has to go back or  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=530) completely disappear  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=532) and this guy may thinks that he's still  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=534) a muslim  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=537) so he's not that he is he is pretending  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=539) to be a muslim he believes that he is a  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=540) muslim  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=541) at least not maybe not mormon he will  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=543) not there saying a moment because most  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=545) people  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=545) knows most people who know this i am a  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=548) true believer everyone knows  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=549) that the true believers would be only  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=551) those who like prophet saw  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=553) and said and holy men exceptionally the  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=556) really truly and complete committed  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=558) believer but he thinks he's still a  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=560) believer  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=560) he has the basic belief although him he  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=563) has maybe a fundamental deficiency  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=565) and testification this deficiency may  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=567) not come sometimes he survives and live  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=569) life long without  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=571) if he faces a test then  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=575) this will flip over and then clearly  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=579) it will be it will be he will fail the  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=581) test and it will show that he  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=583) his allegiance is not to allow his  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=585) messenger which is done  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=586) as a as we will see in surveillance down  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=589) the road but  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=590) you cannot expand on it now because it  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=592) will take several halaqats  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=593) is that in that case this is an act of  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=595) cover the clear statement of the quran  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=597) without any doubt  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=598) there's no way that you can't be that  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=601) you can be a  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=602) a believer even if you witness that  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=605) problem  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=606) if you believe it in my matter of  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=608) logical conclusion that he's a messenger  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=610) while you are willing to fight and the  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=612) banner of the fall against muslims  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=614) whatever justification nationalism  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=616) tribalism material benefit etc  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=620) that's that's not acceptable that's will  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=622) take you out to the food islam which  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=624) attitude will  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=625) will make you a kafir and the harbi also  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=627) so the muslim can kill you at liberty  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=629) and they know they are doing the right  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=630) thing according to  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=632) me so that's that's uh  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=635) one one odd type which many people do  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=637) not know  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=638) another another which is related to that  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=641) that the internal commitment to belief  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=643) is not enough to get you over this  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=645) threshold of coffer now this section  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=647) is very difficult to divine because the  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=650) the levels of the heart and the  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=651) situation of the mind and the  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=653) psyche are complex not easy but allah  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=656) knows that  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=657) we don't need to be indulgent and in  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=659) private but we try to  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=660) give him hints and and directions so  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=663) that uh  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=664) the people can can uh session themselves  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=667) and try to improve their iman  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=668) and get themselves over that barrier for  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=671) example there's a hadith  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=678) there are four who even have one of them  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=683) he has one branch of nifak and he have  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=685) all four of them  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=686) is a pure moon  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=692) now even that had it has been which is a  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=694) good hadith will establish i think that  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=696) from the native language but anyway  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=698) independent uh  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=699) it helps understand the quran it can  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=701) explain further  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=703) because the person views the language  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=705) was giving examples and so on  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=708) even that has been also somehow because  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=711) of the misunderstanding of iman  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=712) by many scholars who are of the  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=714) so-called  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=717) muslims who who define iran only as  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=720) justice as holding something to be true  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=723) without the other actions of the heart  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=725) associated with it  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=727) which led them to to fall in various  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=730) problems and contradictions and issues  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=731) and some of them even  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=733) did not bother about aligning with the  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=734) kuffar and yeah it happened something  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=737) like that happened  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=738) and by some of them while they believe  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=740) that they are doing right the right  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=741) thing because their definition of iman  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=744) is faulty that's just a stick i  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=747) mean i showed that muhammad says that's  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=750) it that's not true that's not enough  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=752) you have to have more of the action to  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=754) be committed to that  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=756) so they at the tibet had they said this  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=757) is the verse  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=761) the action not the creed  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=764) so even if the four  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=766) are accessible of someone he's just but  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=769) he's still not out of the form of islam  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=771) whenever instance of creed like the  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=772) sword about that  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=774) and this is i think this is a big  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=776) feeling  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=778) because the four things you have  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=780) mentioned they have nothing to do with  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=781) creed they have to do with action action  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=783) of the heart or action external action  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=784) but they relate to the action while  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=787) four things he he mentions that in the  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=789) hadith when he  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=791) gives a reward he lies now everyone lies  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=795) we realize of the motivation we are  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=796) afraid of something but  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=798) this one is a systematic liar he is  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=800) habitual liar  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=801) it doesn't lie in central occasion lie  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=804) to escape  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=805) a penalty everyone does that at various  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=807) levels  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=808) of lies there are small lies which are  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=812) to be ignored like for example there are  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=814) some so a woman calling her son  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=816) come here i will give you something and  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=817) she holding something in her hand  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=819) and then uh are you going to give him  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=822) something or just to try to  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=824) to get him so they can hold him she said  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=826) no i have a camera i have a  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=828) one one date see if you didn't have a  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=831) tumblr in your hand  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=832) this would have been written as kudai by  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=834) a small lie against you  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=836) so even if you called your child i give  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=838) you i have some chocolate for you to  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=839) come and you don't have chocolate this  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=840) is more  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=841) we all do that that's not what happened  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=843) but if someone is a habitual liar  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=845) you enjoy lying and false reporting  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=848) especially if he's in a power position  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=850) like a king or a ruler that has one of  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=852) the worst people there  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=854) is malik  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=860) the one who owns the house for example  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=862) is married and have servants  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=864) according to the definition given to  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=866) money israel etc  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=868) there's no reason for you to lie except  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=870) these small lies and these small  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=871) mistakes which no no human could be  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=873) clean from them  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=874) but but if you systematically lying  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=878) then there's a major deficiency about  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=881) your understanding  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=882) that allah is watching you understanding  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=884) the importance of truth or truthfulness  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=894) if he gives a covenant he will break the  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=896) covenant i'll stab you in the back  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=898) that's a very very grave it shows  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=902) the deep evil although he may still  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=904) believe that  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=909) if he is given a trust for example give  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=910) him a trust i give you this money for  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=912) your trust  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=913) keep it in trust and then you come to  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=915) give me give me that give me the bag say  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=916) you didn't give me a bag i have nothing  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=918) here over the back found one yet  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=919) and decided to swallow there were no  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=921) witnesses so  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=925) he takes over the trust that's an  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=928) example and if somebody is trusted  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=930) with a position of power or position of  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=932) administration to do such a thing i said  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=934) according to the revolutionary laws  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=936) and he breaks them because of bribes  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=938) whatever  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=939) usually nobody will break without  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=941) obviously some motivation greed pride  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=943) and so on  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=944) so with that with the hassam of agile if  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=946) he has dispute  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=947) then he goes overboard if you have a  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=950) some dispute  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=952) you may uh for example uh  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=957) i guess we give an example for the one  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=959) who  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=961) went to the extreme uh one abdullah who  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=964) was uh  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=965) was a believer and then um  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=968) most likely publicly he was a believer  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=970) and internally he was a moon africa will  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=971) have this disease in the heart  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=973) which we'll discuss later and he was in  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=975) a trouble and he has a  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=976) servant maybe a slave no one slave and  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=979) he  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=979) told them i am tired now i will have a  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=981) nap cook me with some food  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=984) somehow the slave got busy with  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=985) something else he did not cook went up  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=987) and woke up say who is the food sale  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=991) my master i forgot or i missed it i did  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=993) not start it yet  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=995) he became so outraged he's now disputing  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=998) why did you do that he he could him give  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1000) him maybe a slab or a kick in the water  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1002) or something  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1002) instead of he killed him it's going  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1004) overboard  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1006) in the dispute there's no warrant for  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1009) you that  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1009) your servant did not cook that you kill  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1011) him because of that and then he  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1013) recognized  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1013) that she went overboard and he could not  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1015) face the consequences  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1017) facing the warsaw so he ran to mecca  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1020) and i told them i i joined them and  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1023) became an idolatrous publicly artist or  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1025) maybe in the bottom of heart is not  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1026) regulated anymore in the sense you know  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1028) these idols are nothing here  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1029) at the moment he has embraced islamic  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1031) recognition all nonsense he  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1033) is graduated from that level of magic  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1035) world view  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1036) i do not reveal you into more rational  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1038) and monetaristic  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1039) world view but it doesn't help  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1043) so this is the same of the house oh this  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1045) is extremely a very  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1046) great extreme but there are people for  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1048) example when you have dispute with them  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1051) about something like uh  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1054) uh i had once when someone dispute about  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1057) uh he  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1058) called me phone found me from from from  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1061) manchester in the in the 90s 96 say  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1064) is it true that there is a there's some  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1067) hadith against  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1069) condemnation yeah let me verify that  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1071) tomorrow  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1073) say yes i think they will establish that  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1075) let me check it let me go to the show  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1076) that's what i hear usually  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1078) so i checked i should  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1089) has passed by the time but in the arabic  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1091) side to demolish this idol of  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1093) because as long as the argument if they  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1094) say you can appoint your son for  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1096) something  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1098) sahabi he couldn't have been that bad  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1100) etc  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1101) so you have to break that idol so i made  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1103) a i made some research  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1104) very primitive research at the time and  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1107) uh i sent it to him  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1109) and then he phoned me say are you sure  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1111) this is  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1112) they said this this is good that'd be  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1114) good it's not at the time it was not  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1116) very  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1116) skilled in islam i relied on muslim but  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1119) also that it's not even if you recognize  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1120) it now it is it's good  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1123) and so cinema music  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1126) there's no doubt about that so what he  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1128) said he is disputing that want to  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1130) dispute it  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1131) he says i will go and verify the hadith  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1133) or ask sola to refute and answer to you  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1135) and so on  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1136) he said may allah cares you and my  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1138) muslim with you  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1141) going overboard and there's no reason to  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1143) cares me and because you are muslim  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1144) because he narrated  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1146) he believes this is authentic just  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1147) saying you have mistaken a muslim  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1149) that hadith is is broken and shane is  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1152) not correct  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1153) uh we have to correct this and this so  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1154) far so if someone have these four  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1157) in the head  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1161) we make a covenant if he reports he lies  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1164) as a matter of systematic uh behavior  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1167) not uh  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1168) one on off and so on and not small lies  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1171) like calling a child i'll give you a  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1172) shocking something like these are small  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1174) like they are lies they are  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1175) like they are small sins but they are  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1176) not but that's not what meant in the  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1178) hadith  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1179) that if he reports then he cannot  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1183) get away from lying and adding some  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1184) spices it becomes secret nature to him  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1188) rather if he gives a covenant he will  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1205) it's different that i had is a covenant  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1207) between two and then he break the  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1208) covenant and stab you in the word  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1210) trust you trust him with him whether  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1211) we're doing a certain action  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1213) or keeping a certain money in his safe  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1215) and then he denies that he has it and  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1217) then  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1219) then then so anyone who has these four  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1223) according to organizations  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1227) the statement prophet is a pure moon  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1229) africa now because of the  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1232) mostly  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1250) i think this is this is a considerable  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1252) shortcoming  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1254) i'm not saying it is definitely for  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1257) all cases and so on but even if these  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1259) characteristics  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1260) are in someone then he is a pure  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1262) hypocrite differently in action  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1264) and most likely also include there is in  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1266) the sense of the correct sense of iman  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1268) and creed  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1268) not immediately believing that muhammad  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1270) is the message of allah no no and allah  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1272) exists no  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1272) but in matter of fact what what  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1274) necessary entails  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1276) being a believer and accepting  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1279) and pronouncing shahada and surrendering  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1281) to the meaning of the minimum  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1283) this one does not seem to be the minimal  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1286) surrender of  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1287) if you look at the situation of muslims  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1290) even with despite of the  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1291) low level of iman when the muslims  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1293) generally in the rest of the world and  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1295) there  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1295) you will not find anyone having these  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1297) four and coming really  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1300) you will you will not feel that he  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1301) belongs to the muslim in any sense  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1304) most likely he will be he will be  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1307) will be in any way in any test or any  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1309) confrontation he will be joining the  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1311) kuffar  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1311) rather than being with the muslim and  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1313) then shows that clearly if i can clear  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1316) and clear from them so that that hadith  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1319) should be giving more respect than to  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1320) say this is all  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1322) not in fact no it is it is i think it's  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1326) not say make it singular he  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1330) uh he i think these four if they are in  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1332) that in that form especially in  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1334) in in in a strong form then they  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1337) indicate that  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1338) that's what the man has in his heart is  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1340) just mere creed and believing that these  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1342) are true  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1343) things but he's not willing to to  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1345) surrender to them or submit anything  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1346) like for example  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1348) in the case of a people of foreign  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1360) what they perceived as true they were  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1362) convinced internally the truth  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1364) they decided if we accept that that the  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1366) man is trying the truth  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1368) and accept his demand yeah he's  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1370) demanding us to let vanessa  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1371) go with them then we have lost power  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1376) we have lost the kingdom we are the  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1377) greatest kingdom on earth the biggest  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1379) power on earth at that time  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1380) other short questions we're not going to  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1382) do that  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1384) let's just have a question this is  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1388) not acceptable that's not acceptable  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1392) so this is so uh for example in in the  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1396) 19th century there was a  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1397) a an anarchist i think is it i don't  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1400) think about his name  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1400) was he said  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1404) iblis is the greatest liberator of  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1407) humanity  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1408) we should even worship him because he is  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1410) the one who was able and have the  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1411) courage to confront god  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1414) no the one man may have been an atheist  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1415) and jesus saying in him with the  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1416) bodyguard but he may believe that god  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1418) exists  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1418) and the belief is really opposing god  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1420) and regardless of good act  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1422) what's what's the meaning what's the  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1424) benefit of saying that there's only one  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1425) god  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1426) it doesn't benefit him in anything if he  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1429) believes that  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1430) that everything but i thought and god is  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1432) now oppressor  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1434) so you see you could believe that said  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1436) by allah but allah  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1438) be an oppressor but allah made our life  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1439) miserable  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1441) injunctions or made our life difficult  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1444) by by asking us to  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1445) forsake tribalism and nationalism and  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1447) racism and so on  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1448) and and they devote ourselves to all one  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1451) humanity as  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1452) one as one in sense of racism and so on  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1455) and to one allegiance that registered  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1457) islamic ummah under under islamic  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1459) leadership if it exists  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1461) and then so that we will never be  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1463) fighting under the banner of the kuffar  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1464) for whatever reason  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1467) willingly maybe sexual assault is forced  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1468) to take it to the battlefield by force  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1470) then  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1471) he will he will because because he have  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1474) the allegiance to allah his messenger he  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1475) will  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1476) not show toward the allah he will show  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1477) he will try to shoot in in the wrong  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1479) direction so  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1480) he misses the muslims yeah for example  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1481) if someone is fast that's the same with  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1483) someone's force  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1484) although most modern armies now are  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1485) based on on volunteers and then people  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1488) who join the army  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1489) uh for salary and for for benefits like  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1491) having an education have something like  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1493) that  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1495) so we have to be cautious about this  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1497) this issue of nifakan so and it is  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1499) more complex than the issue of iman  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1501) because it relates  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1502) to mostly to the actions of the heart  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1506) what you call the action of the heart  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1508) this is not enough respect what's  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1510) benefit you say  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1512) there's only one deity meaning the  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1515) ultimate sovereign  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1516) there was even the deserves submission  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1519) there was respect  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1520) there was love and and affection in in  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1523) in the spiritual sense  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1525) if that's not there so what what's the  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1527) first of being one god  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1528) what is this doesn't matter it does it  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1531) does  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1531) it doesn't bring us anywhere forward  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1534) like this anarchist of the 19th century  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1536) i would get his name i just saw a few  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1538) days i forgot his name  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1540) who believe they believe they believe he  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1542) believes there is a  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1544) is a created being it's not the idea  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1546) that he is deserve more respect than god  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1548) because he is the only liberated from  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1549) good  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1549) from god's tyranny for example so  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1553) so what's the benefit of saying there's  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1554) one god and this god is a tyrant  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1556) on this only understand misunderstanding  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1558) of god so there is a misunderstanding of  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1560) god in that  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1560) is related to the what you believe true  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1562) about god maybe in that respect  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1564) but sometimes this is not even there but  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1567) um  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1568) he's demanding too much allah is not  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1570) wanting too much  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1571) but that he should be the ultimate  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1574) surveillance and the ultimate source of  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1575) allegiance  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1576) his allegiance and his rent must be  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1578) higher than anybody else that's  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1579) meaningful deity  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1580) if it is not that then the meaning of  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1583) shahada is really undermined  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1585) intellectually but in in feelings and  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1588) action also  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1589) so it relates to some critical divisions  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1591) you possibly include  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1592) and misunderstanding not recognizing  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1594) what allah is about and his messenger  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1597) but it expressed itself in action  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1600) so that that's that's that's the problem  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1602) which we have to keep in mind  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1604) and uh if you read in the book of tafsir  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1607) they tend  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1608) usually to translate i'll go or or make  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1610) themselves  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1611) by ayah and take things out of the  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1612) context but it's very important to give  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1614) the context  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1615) so we have this kind of people who  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1619) say we believe in life they last and  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1621) last day yeah  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1623) but they are not believers  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1626) in others they are not with allah they  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1628) are not believers  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1629) meaning either they are lying they know  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1632) from themselves they are not believers  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1633) just lying like i say the first category  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1635) the clear category which nobody dispute  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1637) or they believe they are believers but  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1639) allah say no they are not believers they  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1640) are  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1641) they are in in fact lying although they  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1644) they are not their liberty lying but in  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1646) in matter of fact  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1647) they are lying that's not the truth the  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1649) truth is they are not believable  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1650) they cannot be classified as we were in  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1652) the eye of allah lies the definition of  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1654) believer  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1654) made by allah so the two categories are  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1658) so called they are not believer  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1661) either consciously they know they are  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1663) not believer but they are doing it for  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1665) because they are a spy of them for  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1668) foreign to spy  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1670) and then you have to pretend to be  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1671) muslim and do whatever necessary to  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1673) appeal like muslim but they know  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1674) internally  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1675) that they aren't believer they're saying  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1677) believer they are lying deliberately  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1678) consciously and representing themselves  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1681) they're making a drama  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1683) and the other category which  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1686) they don't think they they they think  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1688) they are believer maybe even they are  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1690) allowing them  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1691) in a deficient way  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1694) they think it's correct that's enough  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1696) for them in reality they are not  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1697) believers  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1699) and here comes the danger of these  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1700) theories and this definition of  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1702) iman and so on uh which  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1705) some unfortunately uh some schools of  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1708) thought and some scholar  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1709) will get to the people like for example  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1711) you find very common in the muslim world  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1716) both in arabs and non-arabs like india  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1718) and pakistan is that  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1719) the miscellaneous  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1727) just make sure that in the moment of  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1729) death you say even if you have been  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1732) fighting at the bottom of kaffar even  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1733) you are applying coffer everywhere and  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1735) so on  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1736) and this is a misinterpretation first of  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1738) all hadith the way they're quoted is  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1740) deficient there's no time it's waking up  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1742) out of conviction of the heart so the  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1744) conviction of that is that  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1747) so the pronunciation is just symbolic  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1749) act that's that's all  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1751) usually people around some dying they  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1753) will say like  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1754) he would say it out of conviction and he  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1756) may say just  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1757) just to make them happy if he doesn't  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1759) believe anything but some people will do  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1760) it we don't know  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1761) about these people but we know from  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1763) factual life that  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1764) some people say i am believer to appease  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1766) the people around him  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1767) or make them feel happy and so on a  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1769) reality  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1770) maybe you know even a family one of  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1772) those children is an atheist  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1773) but in front of his parents he doesn't  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1775) want to offend them he doesn't want to  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1776) break the nation completely he pretend  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1778) to be a muslim  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1780) where he's not for example so all of  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1782) these things can happen  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1785) so he is not a believer so either of the  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1787) two types so keep that in mind don't be  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1789) deceived by a  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1790) scholar that they they they are  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1793) pretending and they're deliberately  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1794) doing it it is not always the limit  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1796) if we keep that in mind then we will  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1798) understand the rest of the  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1799) this part of the surah and the the part  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1803) of the eyes in the surah but also the  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1804) other cases which are in  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1806) in  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1811) even there was an extreme case allah  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1813) rebuked the believer  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1815) because some some of the who embraced  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1817) islam they did not immigrate  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1819) they stayed with their own people  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1822) mushrikeen  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1823) but they did not stay there to to carry  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1826) that or just to live normally they were  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1829) they were together with them with the  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1830) kid under their banner fighting that's  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1832) that's right crucial point there  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1834) and then during a ceasefire or a peace  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1838) treaty or  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1839) because they have a protection of  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1840) another tribe which is friendly to the  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1841) muslims  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1842) and they gave the protection they could  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1844) pass through medina and go to the north  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1846) and do their business isham and come  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1848) back that's not horis we're talking  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1849) about  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1850) some people else some other tribes and  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1853) then  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1853) muslims were disputing some people say  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1856) let us take our horses and go and attack  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1858) them and kill them  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1859) because they are fighting with the  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1860) kuffar they are not believers  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1862) they have questions  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1868) did not comment  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1871) because situation is very difficult to  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1873) judge without something from  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1875) clean and  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1889) because they did not immigrate not  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1892) because they  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1893) they they can establish their dinner but  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1894) they were they were even fighting at the  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1896) well of the kuffar  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1897) and so on and then upon details that  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1899) those who are passing because they have  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1900) a covenant or security let them pass  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1902) because of the covenants not because  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1904) they are not believers and there is  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1906) allah says  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1909) they wish that we will commit comfort  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1911) like the community  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1912) and then the as after that talks about  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1914) riddha so this is clear  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1916) no doubt about that these people are  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1918) most likely thinking about themselves  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1920) they are muslims  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1924) so when we say we believe in allah and  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1926) they have judgment  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1928) they are they're telling that that  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1929) they're  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1931) presenting themselves with their own  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1932) self-image which is wrong but they are  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1934) not believer  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1935) as allah has decided they are not  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1936) believers they want to say but they are  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1938) not be moving they are not from the  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1939) believers  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1941) commenting with that despite of that  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1942) statement  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1944) they aren't believers  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1948) it's very important to to be alert about  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1950) this point  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1951) that we have these that's very  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1954) that's i think very crucial which will  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1956) make easy the understanding of all  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1957) issues coming about the 19  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1959) and also clarify let me mention here  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1962) quickly we will come at later in the  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1963) quran  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1974) says  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1992) but they have overlooked the historic  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1994) fact in mecca for example  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1995) let us take an example when when uh  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=1999) that some people embrace islam mecca but  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2002) they didn't embrace it in such  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2004) a full conviction probable understanding  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2006) which prevent them for example when they  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2008) hear the story about uh  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2009) about israel you you remember that  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2012) the very question muhammad claimed that  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2015) he traveled overnight to  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2017) vital markets and came back the same  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2019) night now his his  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2021) his fabrications allah have been exposed  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2023) and they went to some muslims  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2025) do you know that the prophet said this  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2026) is a list and some of them  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2028) committed apostasy because of that  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2033) so how come that they committed  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2035) apostates because of that  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2036) because before that they were not  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2038) totally really but they want africa  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2040) although they believe that they are  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2041) believers how come in makkah  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2044) they embraced islam with such a weak  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2045) faith no  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2047) in a certain phase in makkalak after  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2049) what we call the phase of public now and  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2050) public party  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2051) uh it became fashionable for certain  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2054) young people  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2055) who are rebelling or may want to annoy  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2057) his mother or know some of his tribe and  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2059) so on and  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2060) so that he's his uh he's enjoying this  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2062) new movement he's joining the new  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2064) movement  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2064) without really any deep understanding of  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2066) proper conviction  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2068) because if he had the meaning of  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2069) muhammad he cannot remember  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2071) allah cannot lie allah will not allow  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2074) messenger to rise of his if he is truly  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2075) the messenger of allah  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2076) than what he said they should have said  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2081) they say did he say that they said yes  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2084) he said  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2085) so if he said if he said it he did not  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2087) trust them reportedly  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2089) they showed the difference between  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2090) someone who iran is proper and rational  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2093) and well structured if he has said that  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2097) i will go and share with him if he has  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2098) said that that he's still in the truth  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2099) he's telling me that he is human  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2101) ignoration  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2101) within seconds from from the heaven but  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2104) magnus is next door  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2105) he's not far away so what's the fuss he  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2108) went there and came back  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2110) he must be telling the truth but let me  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2112) go and check  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2114) that's the way it should be so these are  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2117) joining maybe  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2118) the when the that will became public and  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2120) the party became public there would be  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2122) always  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2123) some people who regarded it as cool and  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2125) then and  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2126) uh fashionable to join this movement  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2128) there will be almost  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2130) and this is that's what so they may have  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2132) been very very very well knived in mecca  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2136) they have been very well known people  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2138) who joined just  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2139) for fun and to be cool and to be  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2142) rebellious against the parents  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2144) or just annoy the parents  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2147) and then and and they stuck with it  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2152) some something like or maybe because  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2154) it's a military relation he's in love  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2155) with a girl and  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2156) and she insisted that you become a  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2158) muslim although it was not dictated in  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2160) mecca  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2160) but some some more believing woman  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2163) with the believing woman in mecca was  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2165) were generally more strange and feminine  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2167) believe than  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2168) than many men she said they're going to  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2170) accept  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2179) he hated islam and the prophet that he  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2181) decided to leave madinah and go to sham  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2184) to leave the country all together  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2186) otherwise issues  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2188) abandoned and divorced  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2192) rich man i said offering a considerable  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2195) doubt  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2203) and prove himself through all his life  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2205) that he's a true believer  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2206) so this could happen this could happen  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2209) human nature and human cases  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2211) and variations are so complex and  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2213) unbelievable  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2215) all of you can do the quran and give  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2217) just main headlines and give certain  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2219) sharp  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2219) borders which you've crossed them then  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2221) you are in real danger of comfort  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2224) and for taking all the ayats concerning  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2227) allegiance for the quran fighting and  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2228) their banner against muslims  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2230) on helping or helping them against  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2232) muslim or spying  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2233) against muslim and informing them taking  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2236) all of that on board  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2238) it seems to be the main effect in madina  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2240) the main effect  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2255) as will will uh will it extend so the  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2258) next ayah says  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2262) they trying to con meaning in fact to  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2265) deceive allah reality they are deceiving  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2271) only themselves but they don't perceive  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2272) it  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2273) they don't feel it like it should  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2276) it's just a situation so what  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2279) what is the not perceiving the scholars  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2281) have been split into  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2283) first of all the you'll find the book of  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2284) tafsir i will refer you to these  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2286) about you know how can they try because  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2289) that  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2289) form used usually is  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2294) they and this is usually mutual  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2295) interaction they receive allah and allah  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2297) deceive them  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2298) they see the believer in the name of the  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2299) civilian but that's not necessary  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2302) sometimes it's it's used in  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2304) action from one one side  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2307) in such a way that that the other side  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2310) may be  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2311) responding with that but not necessary  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2312) like for example  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2314) when you say  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2317) may allah declare them they didn't  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2320) declare war to allah allah  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2322) this year that allah finished them  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2324) without necessary  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2326) meaning that that there's a interaction  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2328) in that sense  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2331) but but this is a fine linguistic point  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2333) i think they don't bring us  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2334) in the essential issue which is uh the  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2337) nature of monavie  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2339) much forward so with the with this  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2342) this strength in the case that we are  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2344) talking about some people who say we are  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2346) believing that  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2346) they are saying they are they are doing  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2348) it deliberately lyingly knowing that  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2350) they are not  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2350) a believer so we think about the best  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2352) category  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2359) they actually deceiving himself and  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2362) getting themselves  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2363) in trouble and getting himself in in in  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2366) in  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2373) ultimately if they don't repent before  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2375) that person leave their repentance at  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2376) the moment  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2378) what they don't play they don't perceive  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2380) they don't they don't  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2382) uh they don't notice it but by by  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2386) immediate perception  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2387) because this is in in their what they  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2389) are not noticing  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2391) so there are two to two explanation one  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2393) is that what they are not  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2394) they are not noticing they are not  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2396) believer but this does not sound very  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2399) persuasive actually what they are not  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2400) noticing that they are  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2402) deceiving themselves they think they are  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2404) doing a great job  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2406) they are they have full muhammad is his  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2408) companions  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2410) and maybe he his god because many of  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2412) them  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2413) they they don't bother about allah or  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2415) they say because the quran says  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2417) category of them all remain until the  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2419) time  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2420) it says that they when they come to the  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2423) salaam  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2423) they greet him in such twisted wording  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2426) which is an insult but  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2427) they twist their tongue so it sounds  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2429) like like  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2430) and one example has been narrated that  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2432) the jews when they come to themselves  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2436) which is very close sounding but it's  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2438) assam in this the poison that death is  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2440) on you  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2442) and some of them and african african  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2444) also  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2445) of the jews and so on who pretend to be  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2448) muslims or who  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2449) want to pretend to be friendly and  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2450) peaceful they use this this  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2453) word twisting and so if you look to us  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2455) as irana  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2457) meaning although linguistically is  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2459) possible right  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2461) make notice for me look at me consider  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2464) me  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2465) but i mean you're you're stupid you are  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2469) you are around you are  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2470) you you are not you are you you are you  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2473) are a  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2473) person of uncontrolled behavior which is  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2476) insulting  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2478) and that's the reason the quran has  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2479) prohibited the believer to say to the  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2481) all this linguistic and arabic  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2483) acceptable  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2485) but when they use that when they they  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2488) if allah is really this this allah knows  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2491) what we have in heart  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2492) why allah is not punishing us for that  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2494) what we are doing  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2500) that's clearly the conclusion is that  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2502) because allah is not punishing us  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2503) immediately  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2506) meaning allah does not exist oh this is  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2507) not a messenger and this is again  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2510) a a way of rationalizing things which is  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2514) wrong and irrational allah will not need  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2517) to punish you directly  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2520) he can punish you later he can give you  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2522) an opportunity to repent  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2525) he may be not caring about you you are  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2526) for a community insignificant i remember  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2528) reading once  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2530) something written by an american young  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2532) man who says how he struggled in his  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2534) youth to  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2535) to come to conclusion does god exist or  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2537) not i say  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2538) i used to lie in bed that's written in  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2541) the leaders like i guess in the 60s  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2543) the strategist and they say i used to  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2546) lie in bed after before sleeping  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2548) and swear towards the heaven towards us  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2550) where  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2551) god is allegedly there with the most and  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2554) most nasty insults and swear words  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2558) in the hope that they have provoked god  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2560) to do something so i can't recognize is  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2562) he there or not  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2563) but nothing has happened for a long time  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2565) so i concluded now his conclusion is the  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2567) reason  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2568) so either god does not exist or  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2571) all my swearing i am so insignificant  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2573) and more swearing he doesn't bother  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2574) about my swing i just he let me  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2576) swear as much as like without bothering  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2578) this could be very  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2579) true so at least this young american man  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2582) is more rational than someone african at  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2584) the time  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2585) there are many reasons for allah to  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2586) respond immediately  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2589) this will be a mistake to to  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2592) i cannot really prevent myself from  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2594) having a joke when  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2596) one one scientist wanted to do a test  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2598) about  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2599) the the power of prayer and ask for ask  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2602) the families of certain people in the  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2604) hospital  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2605) to pray for them for the speed recovery  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2607) and uh  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2609) and another group of of of um  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2613) of uh of people sick in the hospital he  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2616) did not ask the family to pray for them  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2618) and he can assume safely that the  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2620) majority of them are secular and  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2621) not very religious so they will not be  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2623) praying and that he did not notice any  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2625) of it so it is like a placebo effect  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2627) you think you say so  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2631) this was this this almost proved that  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2632) god doesn't exist so  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2634) so i commented on that in i i did i  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2637) think i commented somewhere in my  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2638) writing say  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2639) this idiot thinks allah is like a rat in  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2642) in the lab  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2643) you do an experiment with the right you  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2646) over cheese jesus not overseas and so on  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2648) so that's his recipient that allah  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2651) reacts like a rat  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2653) and he doesn't experiment with placebo  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2655) control  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2657) all that he needs to do is maybe a  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2659) double blind evil  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2660) this is all this is all mockery but some  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2662) people have  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2664) whether the this one is a professor or  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2665) medicine or the research and so on  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2668) but that it doesn't mean that  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2669) necessarily that a professor or a  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2671) scientific discipline that you  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2672) that you have achieved rationality and  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2674) will on a  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2676) significant way of thinking that you  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2678) will not commit such  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2679) fundamental philosophical and logical  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2681) blunders so don't be fooled  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2683) by these medical doctors and they by  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2685) these scientists and so on  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2687) some of them in matter of  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2688) rationalization are so poor  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2690) even a small child is superior to them  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2695) most likely motivated but he would like  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2697) to argue allah away somehow so  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2699) we do every possible experiment or we  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2701) did we didn't get any  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2702) any any way to put our finger on him  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2704) you're not going to put your finger in  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2706) that's not the  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2706) your reason has to reach them by  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2708) rationalization not by experimentation  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2710) not by experiments of  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2714) animal experience or something similar  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2716) to animal experience or or  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2717) clinical trials it doesn't work this way  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2720) but some people think this way because  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2722) they have been tuned that is only way of  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2724) science is that  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2725) either clinical trial experimentation or  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2727) controlled observation i could tell  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2728) scholars anything else will not  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2730) get us any information knowledge this is  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2732) a blatant  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2734) dangerous approach of rationality which  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2736) will  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2737) really get you in in fundamental trouble  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2739) you will not recognize how the universe  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2741) work you will not know where you are in  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2743) the  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2743) universe now but back back to the issue  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2746) so  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2749) so i i would say my own and they don't  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2751) perceive it what they don't perceive is  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2752) that they are deceiving themselves  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2755) we're doing a great job we're not  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2757) testing ourselves we're doing the right  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2758) thing  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2759) successful they don't perceive the deep  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2763) reality that  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2764) by what they are doing ultimately will  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2765) end with them in the punishment of allah  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2768) or that they have deceived themselves  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2771) their initial deception  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2772) like for example let us take the case of  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2776) type 1 like a a spy of the kuffar  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2780) and they have been spies of the kuffar  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2782) coming for example and someone spotted  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2784) one of them in egypt sitting  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2785) with a soviet circle with a big beard  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2787) and indulged in this we had tahil  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2790) hundred times  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2791) several hundred times also he grew and  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2792) they recognized him  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2794) uh he's a man of the cia and obviously  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2796) after he finished the job  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2798) he went back to america and the bill is  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2800) gone  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2801) and back to the nice life of of  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2803) washington or new york  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2805) with debauchery and woman and so on and  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2807) drinking as well i can't even believe  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2809) them like maybe he's an atheist to start  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2810) with but he was pretending excellently  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2812) to be a sufi and pretending  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2814) and so on so this man thinks i have  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2817) deceived them i got to  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2818) i got the necessary contacts because  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2820) many of in egypt especially  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2823) people iraqi in the military and so on  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2825) attend the soviet circle and so on  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2827) and by contacting them and having good  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2829) relation with them you may be able to  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2830) get some information some secret  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2832) things like that anyway you will write  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2833) your report and send it to the  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2834) headquarters  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2835) and they will get all the reports and  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2837) analyze it so he came specifically to  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2839) spy on muslims  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2840) so if you ask himself i succeeded to  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2842) receive these idiots muslims  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2843) and by pretending to be a sophie there  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2845) he is  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2847) a reality he deceived himself because he  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2849) deprives him from opportunity  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2853) to find out is islam the truth or not  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2865) because it's very obvious that the  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2867) deception means so when allah says  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2869) they don't perceive that they are  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2871) deceiving themselves not that they are  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2872) not believers  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2874) because this one knows that he is not a  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2875) believer and he planned it and he is  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2877) dealing with a drama at this  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2878) time one type two you will say he's  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2882) deceiving this in both ways  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2883) i'm a believer i may have shahada  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2889) everything is fine but he's deceiving  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2892) himself right there because  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2893) uh he is his clarification his  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2898) classification himself has to be a true  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2899) believer and one who survived in achara  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2901) without any punishment or with  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2903) or escaping the punishment completely is  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2905) wrong because he  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2906) did not uh understand his his  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2909) his belief properly and and sometimes  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2912) the guilty party would be maybe the  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2913) people who give him fatwa and so on so  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2915) it will be  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2915) it will become it will become uh become  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2919) a whole direction  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2920) become a whole uh misguidance  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2923) guided by some some some misguided  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2925) scholars or mistaken scholars  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2928) like for example jesus christian quran  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2930) condemned them say  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2932) they said the the fire will not touch us  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2935) except few days  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2936) whatever we do call us we are the sons  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2938) of god and his darling so whatever we do  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2941) we'll be punished only a few days and  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2942) he'll fail we'll be out allah says  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2944) did you take covenant by allah that he  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2946) would punish you only for a few days  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2949) have you ever covered it from allah they  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2950) have no covenant in your life you've got  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2951) the scripture there's no covenant  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2952) there's the opposite shows severest  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2955) punishment for them  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2956) for transgression for even minor  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2957) translation let alone  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2959) major translation or you are just  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2961) claiming about allah something without  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2963) knowledge  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2963) but this is most likely propagated by  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2965) their by their  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2967) robbies by their priests and so on and  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2969) put in their mind  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2971) so this disease can't can  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2974) can start with scholarship and spread to  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2976) the general public and cause  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2978) a whole nation to become essentially on  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2981) the border of the  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2982) of destruction and demise because they  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2984) are misunderstanding the  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2986) the position the universe understanding  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2987) the relationship  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2989) and this may be based on the eyes and  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2992) fabrication and so on  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2995) so my sharon is focusing on that they  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2997) are not perceiving and not for  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=2999) noticing that they are deceiving  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3001) themselves  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3003) they are very well confident that we are  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3006) not that we are  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3007) we are deceiving the other side either  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3009) deliberately that is  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3010) type  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3016) anybody and we are not deceiving  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3018) ourselves  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3019) right by necessity but in reality they  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3022) are deceiving themselves  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3023) by this deficient create underserved  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3026) deficient proliferation  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3027) and which they want to they wanted to to  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3030) to escape the punishment from okiyama  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3033) without paying the price for it  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3035) remind me just a story about paying the  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3036) price and the  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3044) but there's a problem  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3049) your companion told me that there is a  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3052) zakah and i am man  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3054) i am a man of not very much wealth i  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3055) have only a doubt as a small number of  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3057) comments maybe seven eight ten  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3059) still in five abroads you have to pay  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3060) the cat and uh and i'm stingy here  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3063) the man is honest and open i am stingy  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3067) and i'm afraid if there's a cat  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3070) collector comes i will not  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3072) give out as a cat and you'll be in  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3073) trouble so how can i give you covenant  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3076) and buy up for that secondly  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3077) they say jihad is necessary and i'm a  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3080) coward  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3081) i'm afraid if i meet and they say if  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3083) someone runs away from battlefield he  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3084) will be finished he will be destroyed  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3086) so ha so if i can give you abaya  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3090) with excluding these two items i'm  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3092) willing  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3102) you don't want to place a cat and you  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3104) don't want to do any jihad and you want  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3106) to enter jannah  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3107) right how can you enter general  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3112) how you are going to enter china just  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3114) because you do few raka's and future  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3115) it's not enough  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3116) there's certain other things are  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3117) necessary but jihad sometimes becomes  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3123) is definitely at the foreign you have  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3124) that islam they say there's no escape  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3125) you have to you have to  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3127) that's what he said there's no way to  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3129) get to jannah by this  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3130) by by having a deficient covenant and  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3132) shaking your hand with me that  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3134) i accept islam with the exclusion of  
[0:52:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3135) these two  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3137) uh uh and then he said  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3141) he is nothing in that sense i said i  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3143) said from allah mud  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3145) stretch your hand i will give you  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3146) balances to i will bite the bullet i  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3148) will force myself  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3150) that's the way a believer should be the  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3153) right way we said  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3155) you want to enter paradise if you want  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3156) to enterprise you have to get some in  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3158) some hardship  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3159) you have to to carry it uh to carry some  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3162) burden it doesn't go  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3164) maybe all your life long you will not  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3166) have a zenith blizzard you will never  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3167) play the car you are lucky you get away  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3169) and it will there never be a situation  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3171) that uh go far will be invading your  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3173) country so you need to fight them  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3174) festivals and in  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3178) in or at that time you are old and  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3182) you're excluded from your heart or you  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3183) are blind that you cannot fight someone  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3185) is fighting  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3186) you don't know what happened in the  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3187) future but in principle you have to be  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3189) ready for this  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3192) allah  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3201) with these two without these two you  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3203) have to there's a many moment these two  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3205) there's  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3205) no escape from the minimum  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3209) so so as either another type one or one  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3213) after  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3213) two whenever one they are conscious that  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3215) they are deceiving the believer and they  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3217) think deceiving allah if they believe in  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3219) his existence  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3220) like the cia man who was sitting in the  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3222) soviet circus  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3224) in cairo according to the reports for  
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3226) long for many years  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3227) before he bailed out and went back  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3230) but he but he does not perceive that  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3232) he's deceiving himself because she  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3233) thinks i'm doing a great job  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3235) i'm deceiving everyone no not myself i  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3237) know i do i know i know very well that  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3239) i'm doing  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3239) that's the type one when i type two  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3243) he thinks i am not receiving nobody no  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3245) allah no  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3246) i'm real believer with this deficient  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3248) belief i am a believer  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3249) he's deceiving himself about his own  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3251) iman that is iman is sufficient and good  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3254) enough  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3255) to enter jannah he's not willing to to  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3258) do more  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3260) as i said some of these of weak faith  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3262) may get lucky and escape  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3264) any test tribulation but it's very  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3266) unlikely because tribulation is not only  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3268) that the foreign enemy is inviting your  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3270) country  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3271) no or you you have never enough money or  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3275) enough money left at the end of the year  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3277) to pay zakah  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3278) no tribulation could happen that's where  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3281) one of your beloved one is uh is killed  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3284) in an accident  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3286) and you do not make any sense about  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3289) about how the extent happened why you  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3291) are the one or the only one for example  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3293) your son  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3293) in a bus school bus under school must  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3296) have a major accident  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3297) and almost everyone survived except you  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3299) your son or one other one  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3300) is killed going my son once physically  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3302) myself or  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3304) one  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3306) [Music]  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3317) i remember myself watching television in  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3320) 1981-82  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3321) there was an america in a sabbatical  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3323) year in the lawrence livermore  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3325) laboratory and the university of  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3326) berkeley  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3327) during a sabbatical and then during that  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3330) year there was a mudslide in daly city  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3332) on the other side  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3333) i was in berkeley and in san francisco  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3335) daily city and san francisco  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3337) is quite rainy and that there are like  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3339) heavy areas  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3340) and they seem to be they didn't prepare  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3342) the ground properly  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3343) or they prepared it probably but  
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3345) sometimes the rain is so heavy  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3347) that nothing can be done except that  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3349) just suffer through a  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3351) mudslide so there was a mudslide and  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3353) there were houses alongside  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3355) and then the television showed the  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3357) calamity and people screaming and the  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3359) man  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3360) like in his 40 said the house  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3363) mud came i barely escaped outside and  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3366) and then  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3367) but the mud part of the mud caught my  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3370) daughter his daughter was like in her  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3372) twenties or so  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3373) uh like what they call the flower asian  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3375) possibly she was maybe  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3376) being prepared to get married or  
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3378) something like that and then say i hold  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3380) her  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3380) i held her hand try to pull her out of  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3382) the mud and he's demonstrating that in  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3384) front of my eyes  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3385) in the in in the television  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3389) but it was very difficult and it was  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3391) screaming oh god help me  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3393) but god did not help me and the mud  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3396) swallowed here she's gone away  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3401) there's no god how come that he did not  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3404) help me  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3405) so this man understanding of god and  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3408) qatar and the universe  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3409) is that allah is obliged to help him  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3411) oblige to to undo the action of the  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3413) mudslide  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3414) the mudslide is the result of the rain  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3416) and that area is there any area  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3418) sometimes there isn't me  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3420) that's how hurricanes does not emerge  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3422) that's the nature of the atmosphere  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3424) is going to change the universe because  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3426) if someone is  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3427) asking for it but if it's working like  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3429) that and it's part of the testing  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3431) so he's misunderstood his understanding  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3433) of allah  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3435) and the relation to allah is wrong  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3438) there's deficiency in understanding  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3439) allah there's  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3440) all the general this is widespread in  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3442) christian because they're  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3443) the extreme point of view that allah is  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3445) extremely benevolent to the level that  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3446) he even sacrificed  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3448) loved the world so much like according  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3450) to john that he  
[0:57:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3451) uh was willing or is willing to  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3453) sacrifice his own son to save the people  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3455) from sin  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3456) that's that's that's extremely dangerous  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3459) and will invite you in trouble  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3462) so it's more interesting but you will  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3464) find some belonging to the muslim fear  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3466) will will collapse it will be collapsing  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3468) under such situation  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3469) why you didn't you helped you allah in  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3471) this situation you will find  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3472) but it's not as well why displayed as as  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3475) uh  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3477) i saw an interview with with the with an  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3479) english woman  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3480) i think i i read that i didn't see it i  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3482) read it  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3484) why did i became an atheist she had she  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3486) she was i think her husband  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3488) died some time ago and the only combine  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3489) she has was a dog nice dog  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3491) lovely dog and dog is a very good  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3493) company as you know good  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3494) dogs are very kind and very very smooth  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3497) and  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3497) and you could develop an excellent  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3499) relationship that's one of the reasons  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3500) that islam  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3501) tried to make a difference with them  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3502) because they could the narration could  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3504) become emotionally  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3505) very demanding even better than the  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3506) nation with on children  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3508) and the only the only  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3512) really joy in her life was this dog  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3514) walking him out going out or somehow  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3516) or better than a child i think even her  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3517) children if she has children they have  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3519) abandoned her  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3520) like unfortunately in this society very  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3522) wisely  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3523) and then one day i think the dog was  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3525) playing around and jumping jumped the  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3527) street and the car killed the dog  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3530) and she said this cannot god could not  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3532) have permitted that to happen  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3534) he doesn't exist so if you came here it  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3536) is because of that  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3539) so so the test does not need an army  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3542) invade your country  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3543) or you become rich and then you face the  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3546) the  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3547) the the shock of building out the zakah  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3549) and paying uh  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3550) and paying your dues no it can be even  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3553) other situation  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3554) even for poor people other people and  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3557) here the the  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3558) the deficiency in in very previously  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3560) before the test  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3561) is that your understanding of allah and  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3564) his  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3564) and his actions in the universe is not  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3567) correct  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3567) it's deficient you have the wrong belief  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3569) about allah or  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3570) partly our own belief which will bring  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3573) you into trouble  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3574) when such a test comes  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3578) so that's that's just how  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3581) some people so these before before the  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3584) testing  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3596) some get lucky all their lives are not  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3598) tested but it's very unlikely because  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3599) there will be some kind of test  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3602) there'll be some kind of test  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3605) even in own health getting suddenly a  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3607) cancer why why me  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3609) i'm not a smoker how come that i get the  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3610) cancer why my neighbor is smoking  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3612) like a chimney and is not getting cancer  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3615) and then starting to blame  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3617) and and questioning him get out of islam  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3621) to cover them with this way  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3625) so all of these things are have to be  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3627) kept in mind that we  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3629) that we don't fall in the trap of of uh  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3632) misunderstanding and underestimating the  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3634) danger of the danger of the fact or not  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3637) because that danger is apparent when  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3640) someone believes that the fact is only  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3641) in the fact  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3642) of time one if you for us only if the  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3646) result we have from today is that in  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3647) fact is not only type one  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3649) but there is also type two which is you  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3651) then one african city is not aware that  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3652) he is a monafied  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3656) then if we take this this this important  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3659) fact uh  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3660) on board then uh we have we have uh  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3663) gained a sense of what these eyes are  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3666) trying to  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3667) to to present to us other than this  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3669) further aspect of what in fact  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3671) we'll discuss inshallah next next  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3674) but most important is that not to  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3677) commit a mistake like many classical  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3679) scholars especially in the later  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3681) generations  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3688) are much more cautious in the later  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3690) generation because the widespread  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3691) uh definition of iman is just purely  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3694) just there purely believing something to  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3695) be true  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3697) can be misleading and can cause well but  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3699) we discussed also in the issue of iman  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3702) and we discussed also in the issue of  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3703) kophor which is the opposite of iman  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3705) now we have a more complex one which is  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3707) delivered but we'll continue inshallah  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3709) with other features about omar 15  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3712) were given to them to see which kind  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3714) although  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3715) most of the talk here is essentially as  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3717) we receive them there is about one  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3718) africa of time one  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3720) and the real especially the relation  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3721) between the jews and the  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3723) one african of the jews of african assad  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3725) who are friends of the jews  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3726) with islam will come to that but keep in  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3729) mind  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3730) the danger and the uh  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3733) of being being afraid number two of type  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3736) two  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3738) i will continue next week with the  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3740) various aspects and  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3741) intricacies of the this phenomenon of  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3744) and what does it also  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3745) keep in mind that in in in the sense i  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3748) explained in mecca  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3749) there's no need to believe that this  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3751) ayah in the matthew  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3758) they give the example of the story of  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3761) israel  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3761) and how some people just left islam  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3764) because they became altered when they  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3765) were shocked about that  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3766) because their iman is having a  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3768) fundamental deficiency either a matter  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3770) of understanding  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3771) or a mental commitment or both  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3775) so i think  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3780) we can we can get some questions  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3783) or post one the question until we have  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3784) the uh close them because the various  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3786) aspects of  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3787) of this issue uh to be discussed next  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3789) time or time but if there's any  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3791) questions related to this immediately we  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3793) can we can discuss it now  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3797) no questions have come through this  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3798) session okay i think it's clear but it's  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3801) very important to just i think this is  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3803) which has been  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3804) out of the of the focus and the view of  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3807) majority of muslim and even scholars  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3810) is that there is time too this  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3814) seems to be this doesn't come in their  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3815) mind it always in their mind that the  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3817) monarch is the one who is  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3819) publicly a muslim but internally a  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3820) catholic and it seems to be there  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3822) assuming by default that he is  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3823) internally a cover  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3825) and he is conscious that he is a  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3827) catholic and he knows that he's a  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3828) catholic he's just  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3829) deceiving everyone and playing the game  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3831) for whatever social games and so on  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3833) and things are also involved social  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3835) games they're making mistakes  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3844) is a big mess but if we thought things  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3847) like this way  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3848) then we will will we shall have a better  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3851) understanding  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3852) and have more benefit from the eyes  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3854) about the vacuum  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3855) or and we will be able to to  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3859) to understand things better inshallah  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3868) [Music]  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/j5unWL0_bx4?t=3890) you
