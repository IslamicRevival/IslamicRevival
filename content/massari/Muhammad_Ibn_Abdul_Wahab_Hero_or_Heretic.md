### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=3600)

 discusses arguments for and against Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, with the main argument being that he was either a hero or a heretic.  argues that there is no clear definition for who is a "sahabi," and that this ambiguity has led to various disputes and disagreements among Muslims. It also discusses the idea that different companions had different levels of understanding of the Quran, and that this difference in understanding makes the companions' understanding of the Quran the "best of understanding."

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=0)**  discusses various arguments surrounding Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, with the Saudi government scholar being the most prominent. The main themes of the Saudi camp are that he was a pure kidde of the Salaf, that there is a consensus on what constitutes Salif, and that ruling and accountability must come from those who follow Salif. The rebuttals provided by various Islamic YouTubers and personalities do not adequately address these points, and instead present a narrative which the Saudi government does not agree with. Sheikh Muhammad al-Masri, a professor of physics, has produced strong evidence which challenges the Saudi government's scholarship. He is a prominent activist in the UK, and his books on fundamental issues have made him well-known in the Islamic world.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=300)**  discusses the different types of salafis or "followers of the rightly-guided caliphs" and their differences. One of the main points made is that there is no clear definition of a salafi, and even the early salafis did not have a clear definition of what constituted a salafi. Professor Muhammad explains that a salafi is someone who is rooted in the early, authentic salafiyya tradition and has a deep understanding of Islamic theology.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=600)** The author of the video argues that there is no clear definition for who is a "sahabi," and that this ambiguity has led to various disputes and disagreements among Muslims.  also argues that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab was not a true sahabi because he did not spend enough time in Medina.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=900)**  discusses the idea that different companions had different levels of understanding of the Quran. It argues that this difference in understanding makes the companions' understanding of the Quran the "best of understanding." However, the video argues that this understanding is not based on empirical evidence, and instead is based on the companions' innate qualities.  also argues that the companions were sincere and willing to sacrifice their lives for Islam.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=1200)**  discusses the differences between Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab and other reformists in Islam, highlighting Ibn Abdul Wahab's more extreme views. Ibn Abdul Wahab is considered a hero by some Wahhabis, while others view him as a heretic.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=1500)**  Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab is compared to various sahaba in terms of their level of comprehension and understanding. He argues that there are many issues of understanding and comprehension that were already disagreed upon by the sahaba, and that there is no evidence that the prophets were angels or living in other worlds.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=1800)** Theta Vida argues that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab was either a hero or a heretic, depending on whether one believes in his fundamental beliefs. He claims that the majority of Muslims follow the same path, but that there are secondary issues that Muslims must know about, like the fact that Allah created the heavens in six days and after that he mounted the throne. He argues that this is not a matter of consensus, and that even if a scholar disagrees with the beliefs of Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, they are still obliged to know about them.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=2100)** The speaker discusses an Islamic belief that there are two types of worship: " Active" or "ritual" worship, and "worship of creation." The speaker contends that the definition of "worship" given in this belief is not consistent with the definition given in the Quran. The speaker argues that this belief is a "slap" to the Quran, and that it flies in the face of the Islamic belief that Allah is without sons.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=2400)**  discusses the various reasons why Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab might be considered a hero or heretic. It argues that, if Allah is not capable of having a son, then this would mean that other deities exist which can take creation away from Allah. Furthermore, the video argues that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab was obsessed with this idea to the point where he was able to cooperate with a ruler to have power.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=2700)**  discusses how Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, a hero or heretic, differed from other Islamic leaders in that he was focused on establishing power and convincing the population to obey instead of rebelling against religious authority.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=3000)** 
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=3300)**  discusses secondary questions about the Quran, such as whether it was created or not. It goes on to say that these are all minor issues, and that the main issue is that Muhammad and his followers disagreed on certain theological matters.  argues that this is why the issue of the Quran's creation is not a major one, and that evidence is needed to support any claims.

 discusses the controversy around the late Islamic scholar Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab. Ibn Abdul Wahab believed that it was better to do less obligatory prayers in order to make it easier for people to follow the religion. He also disagreed with the practice of reciting the Quran in Arabic, considering it to be a form of idolatry. Despite these disagreements, many Muslims regard him as a hero for his efforts to spread Islam in the Arabian Peninsula.

* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=3900)** The speaker argues that Prophet Muhammad was a hero or heretic based on his statements about how small and small-sized stones are best suited for prayer.

* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=4200)** This YouTube video discusses a Hadith in which a man is described as having a strike in his face indicative of the devil.  goes on to discuss how this man may be a model of piety, but is different from the majority of Muslims in that he is not focused purely on religious practices.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=4500)** This YouTube video discusses the controversial Islamic figure Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, who is either a hero or heretic. The narrator discusses how Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab differed from the other Muslim leaders of his time, and how he hesitated before attempting to kill a man who was reportedly praying.  finishes with a discussion of why it is impossible for Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab to have killed the man, as his history would have to take away from his claim to be a true Muslim.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=4800)** 
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=5100)**  discusses the different rulings that Allah has established, including arbitration. It goes on to say that even when an arbitration is carried out, it is only for the benefit of Allah.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=5400)**  discusses how Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, a Muslim reformer, is either a hero or heretic, depending on how one interprets his teachings.

He also points out that if an Imam after college has expired, then Allah will place the case of all people upon them.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=6300)** The narrator discusses a Hadith in which Muhammad orders Muslims not to obey non-Muslims in court or attach resources to them, emphasizing the importance of obedience to Allah. He points out that this Hadith does not support the Madras's narrative that non-Muslims are "evil" and "oppressor[s] of Muslims." The narrator explains that the reason the Hadith is ignored is because some Hadith scholars try to use it to support their argument that there is no government in Islam. He warns that this mindset will lead to Muslims losing their faith.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=6600)** Imam Ibn Abdul Wahab was a Mujaddid who argued that the consensus of scholars is not based on anything, and that Hadith should be studied for its virtues, not its faults. He also cautioned against blindly following any Imam, and advised learning the Quran and applying it to one's life.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=6900)** Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab discusses the importance of studying the Quran and applying it to one's life, contrasting this advice with that of people who focus on worldly matters such as fitness.

He warns that society is on the brink of disaster, and that the only way to save people is to have a leader who can provide peace and order.

The author points out that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab took things out of context to achieve his goals, and that he was very sophisticated in his manipulation of people.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=7200)** Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab was either a hero or heretic, depending on one's perspective. Before his death, Ibn Abdul Wahab disclosed some of his thoughts on religion, mathematics, and other topics. He was not a scholar, but his writings were respected by some. After he died, his ideas were dismissed by scholars, who argued that he was not qualified to speak on such matters.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=7500)**  discusses how some Muslims believe that venerating graves is idolatry, and how this belief is used to avoid discussing controversial issues with them.

He points out that there is no such thing as a " secular celebrity" in Islam, because there is no such thing as a secular world. The kingdom of God, which Muslims believe will be established on earth, is an Otherworldly reality. Christianity, which he argues is a complete deviation from true Islam, is the only religion that has survived since the third century. He urges Muslims not to get involved in secular matters, as these are distractions from the goal of establishing Allah's justice on earth.
* **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=8700)**  Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, a scholar and religious leader, is discussed.

* **[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRawmTCJeh0&t=10500)**  David argues that, according to the Qur'an, worship is only due to Allah, and that there is no other deity beside Him. He also points out that, based on this principle, Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab -- considered a hero by many Muslims -- was actually a heretic because he worshipped other beings besides Allah.

[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=203) Rahman and salafi Publications we feel  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=206) are not quite addressing the issue  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=208) adequately and have provided a narrative  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=210) which we don't agree with which we  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=212) certainly think this is the junction for  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=214) us to rebuttal  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=216) we hope this is just a the beginning  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=218) Salvo and we are more than open to open  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=221) discussion and facilitating any kind of  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=223) discussions directly or on other  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=226) people's media channels  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=227) um and before I hand over to Sheikh I'll  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=229) give a brief introduction as to the uh  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=231) as to who Sheikh Professor Muhammad  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=233) al-masri is and his background Professor

[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=239) previously a professor of physics and he  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=241) comes from a lineage of Scholars his  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=243) father uh with a contemporary of being  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=245) bad and his cried and his grandfather  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=246) was the Imam  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=248) in the 80s and 90s he formed a group to  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=252) account the rulership of el Saud  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=255) called the committee of Defense  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=256) committee the committee of Defense to  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=259) the legitimate rights  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=261) cdlr  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=262) um he was unfortunately Exile from  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=265) chased out of Saudi rather and seeked uh  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=268) sought asylum in the UK and has been a  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=270) very prominent activist in the UK  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=272) he has produced quite a number of books  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=274) uh books that are being published in  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=276) English as well as uh currently in  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=277) Arabic on some very fundamental issues  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=280) and has really clarified a lot of  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=282) fundamental issues which were taken as  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=285) um as dismissed by the Saudi government  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=288) scholarship because it's not in the  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=291) interest to entertain these kinds of  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=292) issues and the the material that's been  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=294) produced we can say with confidence is  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=296) very strong and reaches the level of  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=297) moto in terms of evidences are  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=300) referenced  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=301) um however we will publish those links  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=303) but without further Ado I'd like to hand  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=305) over to Professor Muhammad  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=308) and  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=310) Professor you're familiar with with the  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=313) current uh dialogue that's been  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=315) happening between uh these various camps  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=318) um  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=318) what is it just to start things off what  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=322) is your understanding of what  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=323) constitutes a seller and this is  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=325) distance from Akida isn't that a good  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=328) thing is there a consensus on what  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=330) constitutes Akita and is this something  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=332) that is something which we should aspire  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=334) to and this is uh what they what they  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=337) call salafand or the definition of self  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=339) is uh is relatively late uh it it was  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=343) used casually like for example we have  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=346) one one Hadith narrating scholar of high  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=350) level of authenticity and exactness and  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=353) matter of narratives and the other  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=355) personal piety he was doing doing rebat  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=358) doing guarding at the border of the  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=360) Romans and and so on but he was quite  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=365) negative to some Scholars because his  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=366) goofy is from otakafi origin he was  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=369) negative to other Scholars and did not  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=371) want to sit with them and so on because  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=373) he said they attacked the salaf actually  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=374) they were attacking that's what he means  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=377) her so the word like that is  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=379) the previous generation the past  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=382) the the similar in the in the in  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=385) Christianity we talk about the  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=387) disciplines of the Apostles that's  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=388) something something like that but it was  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=390) not made precise and nobody dedicated  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=392) himself  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=394) until we we uh we came almost to the  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=398) fourth century when the first one called  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=399) himself salafi is  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=403) so it became like a title  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=406) so it is  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=407) meaning what have been passed but it is  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=411) what's the definition  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=413) there's no nuclear definition if you ask  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=416) them to say the three good degenerations  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=418) according to a Hadith that the best of  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=420) the of the human species or another is  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=423) are the three my uh these my my  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=427) generation and then the one for the  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=428) followers and the fair to follow and  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=431) some Nations say he mentioned four  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=432) something just say three so we can agree  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=434) on three definitely  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=436) that's that's that's the that's the  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=438) first one then  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=440) when things are scrutinized a little bit  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=442) it turns out that the third generation  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=444) is having so much divergences and points  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=447) of view  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=448) even less than what we have now so they  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=451) escape to tavieri Second Generation  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=453) meaning generation meaning companions  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=455) that one moment also the profit Etc  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=457) would have an obscore of definition will  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=459) come to that and then the one who follow  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=461) them called tabulary which are  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=463) themselves  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=468) but the Mr Prophet did not meet him  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=471) because they blessed Islam later or they  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=473) were far away and this is the elder or a  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=477) senior tabian that's the one who are  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=479) born just maybe time Abu Bakr or the end  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=482) time of the Prophet so they cannot come  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=484) that's companion  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=485) and then we have the middle tab here in  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=487) the one boy it's actually born around  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=490) the time of the end time of Omar and  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=492) then the under middle  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=494) which are born about the time of the end  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=496) of Osman and then there's  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=498) in the 50s history and so on like like  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=502) uh the famous One is  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=505) because he met at least and he got from  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=508) anasematic so he's a table  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=510) with the lowest generation is wise  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=514) but also these have various  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=516) disagreements and various conflicts and  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=518) various talents and various things so  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=520) they escape to the sahaba  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=522) and then you have the problem with the  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=524) definition who is also happy  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=527) there was no clear definition even even  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=529) the the Tiberian and the sahaba did not  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=531) have a clear definition for example they  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=534) got the best and the great of tabby and  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=536) the most Pious and maybe in Hadith  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=538) sounds more exact thing I would say  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=540) shabby is more exact thing of narrative  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=543) and more sharp in The Knowing men but of  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=546) course I don't say was more more Pious  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=547) and more pure-hearted but more  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=549) straightforward and to know the men and  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=551) concise them and analyze them you need  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=553) to be a little bit more a man of  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=555) political insight and Analysis of  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=557) personality so shall be superior shall  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=560) we say I took from a trustworthy source  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=562) and mentioned the name of the source  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=564) then you can realize really translated  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=565) them thoroughly always a human being he  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=568) may made a failure here and there  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=570) sometimes  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=572) uh side woman said is regarded the same  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=575) category but because he's someone who is  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=577) straightforward and trusting he may be  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=579) misled or fooled by someone thinking  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=581) he's trustworthy is not  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=583) that's depending on how to analyze men  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=585) and the character but I'm just  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=586) mentioning that as a casual information  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=588) aside from the same say asahabi is the  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=590) one who stayed with a prophet one one  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=593) year or two years or participated in one  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=596) or two battle campaigns with him so he  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=598) regard anyone anything less than one  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=600) year anything like less than one battle  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=603) campaign as not enough to be a Sahari  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=608) that that will create a problem for many  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=610) with the regardless so happy many of the  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=613) plenty of knowledge of people who are  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=615) not according to definition some people  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=617) say no he must have attended at least  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=619) three battle uh  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=621) combat Etc somebody say it has to be a  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=624) resident of Madina like answer Marcos  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=626) asked is there any sahabilities because  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=628) you stayed until High age I think he  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=631) maybe he outlives that high judge maybe  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=632) he died 95 degrees  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=634) and high age say they ask him in high  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=637) age is that it is a happy lift  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=639) besides you so no no there's none except  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=642) maybe some Bedouins so he didn't regard  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=644) them asahabi they saw him between  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=647) so for him you have to be combining him  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=650) in Medina for a certain time  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=653) so that's again the division of sahabi  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=655) because we We Know by from the statement  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=657) if we if she shows any definition  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=660) whatsoever they will be under them on a  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=663) 15 by the clear and fundamental text of  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=665) the Quran  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=695) we know them  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=698) we will punish them twice and Dunya and  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=700) they won't be returned to enormous  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=702) punishment meaning they will die cover  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=704) otherwise did not know them  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=706) those in Medina are most likely  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=708) interacting we know some of them by name  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=710) one of them at least alone who is known  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=712) as the one after nobody but he  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=714) participated the battle campaigns he  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=716) initiated the story of the Afghan attack  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=718) against Asha all of this and he is the  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=720) one who said in his private circles now  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=722) that's the end we are we adopted  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=724) Muhammad and gave him protection and  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=726) make him fat and now according to the  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=728) old saying make your dog fat he will eat  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=730) you meaning Muhammad is a dog  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=732) and he denied that saying that but the  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=734) Quran explores him  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=736) so we have that so there's no Escape  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=739) there's various  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=741) at this point just just to put the setup  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=743) in the corner first that even your  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=745) depletion of sahaba is not clear not  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=747) well established is an old record  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=749) nothing one Hadith not two five six a  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=752) Hadith  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=753) that's why my companion even the Hadith  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=757) about the Jews who promoted to kill him  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=758) in akaba on the way back from tabuk in  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=760) the ninth year  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=762) few people saw the prophet Sam took the  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=764) high mountain way and asked the Army to  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=766) go the valley and said nobody should  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=768) take the high mountain way except the  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=769) prophet  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=771) and he took it why we don't know maybe  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=773) he wanted to be supervising what's going  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=775) on seeing what's going on and that way  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=777) is very narrow Canada so there was uh  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=780) someone sent in the Army calling nobody  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=783) should take that that way is only for  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=785) the messenger Allah  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=786) said good opportunity that you will  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=789) attend we did not hear or we hit and  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=790) then we go that way about 15 of them and  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=793) we push him over the Ridge and get rid  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=795) of him  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=801) famous event well established narrated  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=803) by tawater  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=805) and then the process that I'm exposed  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=809) them and I think for therefore I'm  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=811) struck their the comments in the face  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=813) too they went downhill and so on and  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=815) nothing has happened and then he told  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=818) the uh  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=821) [Music]  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=822) in one of the leader of a house this  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=826) this happened Andrew says it's very  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=828) simple send someone to their tribes so  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=831) they you know them say I know them and  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=833) even the holiday for our knew their  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=835) comments so they can be identified and  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=838) sent an order to get it or get the next  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=841) track this is their Association against  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=842) the head of state it's high treason  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=845) you're stuck as the museum said no I'm  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=847) not going to do that obviously because  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=849) it's prohibited to do that it has it  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=852) will have the result that the people say  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=853) Muhammad is killing his companions  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=856) but they are not companionship was  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=858) insisted again repeated I am not going  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=860) to kill my companion meaning you're you  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=862) will claim that they are not combining  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=864) is wrong the word companion fits on them  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=866) so the companion is kept in the Arabic  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=868) language meaning Arabic language is  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=869) someone going with you on about on a  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=873) trip is a companion some your wife is  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=876) your companion  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=877) says  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=881) is a companion so he kept it in the  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=884) linguistic meaning so all these  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=885) definitions are wavering and they're not  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=887) wearing anything for Fruitful  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=889) is very well known we know that from  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=892) various historic reasons  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=895) they want to get Maui to have the honor  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=898) on the protection of companion but they  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=901) will not succeed that's just a Prelude  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=903) so salaf is not well defined and even  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=906) the companion is not clearly well  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=907) defined  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=909) secondly okay say they say the sahaba  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=912) were around the prophet  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=913) and they saw the revelation of the Quran  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=916) Etc  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=917) and they are most of them except a few  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=920) which do not count five six seven are  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=923) not Arabic speaker Arabic speaker so  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=927) they answered the Arabic language better  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=928) than us by Nature they are born in  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=930) Arabic language we we have to learn it  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=931) by effort as a foreign language for us  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=934) now I mean the high Arabic Arabic even  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=936) myself  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=938) is a direct not a high Arabic so I have  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=942) to learn Safari language it's easy  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=944) obviously because the direct is close  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=945) but still I have to learn it but the one  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=948) born in it it is done in his blood he  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=950) has the taste of it so based on that  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=952) their understanding mystery must be the  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=954) best of understanding  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=956) but again a fallacy first one because  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=959) understanding is related to Satan not  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=961) only understanding Arabic and being with  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=963) the prophet is related to the certain  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=965) mental and intellectual capabilities not  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=968) everyone is having  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=970) and depth of understanding and we have  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=972) many evidences that many of the  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=973) companions were quite simple-minded and  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=975) very Shadow it doesn't mean it doesn't  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=978) stain them because their virtue is being  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=980) that they are  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=986) secondly they are sincere and they are  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=988) willing to sacrifice their life on their  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=990) wealth for Islam that's what gave them  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=992) the virtue  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=993) High virtue not that they are better  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=995) understanding and evidence show that  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=997) give you just one example just casual  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=999) example for the reason that they don't  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1000) know these things for example in one  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1002) Hadith where is  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1004) casually  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1005) related to khilafa and election and so  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1008) on Asians we were in in in in in in  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1011) Mina with Omar in his last bill garment  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1014) before he died  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1016) and someone and I was imagine even Abbas  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1020) who was just coming out of age when the  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1022) prophet died because he was just coming  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1024) up to age we know the other narrations  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1026) foreign  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1054) so it's not it's not this is a fallacy  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1057) but also in his final sermon said  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1061) those who have this heard me  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1065) they should report what they hid as they  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1067) heard it  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1069) may Allah make the face beautiful with  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1071) the one who hear what I say  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1073) as it is and reported that this is to  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1075) other people who are not present here  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1077) including people in the future because  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1081) maybe someone receiving the message  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1083) comprehend it better and make sense  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1085) better of it than the one who hears it  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1087) now  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1088) so even that refused that  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1091) so this is a fallacy  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1093) secondly what's meaning the self the  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1095) idea the point of view yourself  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1097) because they have we have absolute  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1100) evidence that they agree disagreed and  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1102) many issue some of them very substantial  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1103) like personal disagree disagree Edition  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1105) disagreement between uh abubakar and  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1107) Omar about fighting  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1111) and it came to a dispute until even  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1114) until even said shocked himself  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1118) and the coward in Islam I am not going  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1121) to let those who do not pay there's a  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1123) guy get away I'm going to fight them  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1124) until they pay it's not allowable  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1127) Under Armor then caved in because  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1129) without Authority and the character of  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1131) Abu Bakr that's all but they had to read  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1132) in such a potential point and there's  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1134) many other disagreement so what does  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1137) this mean the point of view  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1139) and the teaching of the Salah there are  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1141) various disagreement even in such an  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1142) important Point fighting someone and  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1144) killing someone is a fundamental issue  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1146) Bloodshed is a series  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1151) so  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1155) has adopted  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1158) not only is something which makes sense  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1160) is that what they agreed all of them  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1162) let's assume  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1164) if you check you will not find ishma  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1167) almost in nothing except with copyright  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1170) from Islam which nobody disagree for  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1171) your stamina of this  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1174) genuine one which is well established  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1176) and also narrated by tawato because you  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1178) have to be to be sure that it's well  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1180) established and there is really ijima  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1182) that many people must have reported that  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1184) other it is few people making a factor  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1187) maybe in kufa and the people in Yemen  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1189) are not aware about that so it's  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1190) currently College  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1192) the result is that only the couple of  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1195) Islam which there is no disagreement  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1196) actually only those who prefer to get  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1199) out of cover and depart Islam will not  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1201) would disagree so it doesn't give us any  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1204) any uh advice or the or Direction where  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1207) to go in in issues of differences in  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1210) fact and secondary issues what they call  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1213) Akida which is again  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1215) name so  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1217) in reality if we scrutinize because the  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1220) one using the way itself most commonly  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1222) the wahhabi or the they call themselves  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1225) salafi they don't like the word Hobby  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1228) but really the other side of you are not  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1230) a hobby so they should be called wahhabi  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1232) and even tell me here was definitely are  
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1235) more open-minded and wiser than the Hub  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1238) is is not a good student of him it's  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1240) related by generation but he grew in the  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1242) school with Emi and became even more  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1244) extreme  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1245) he uses self  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1247) as an other going to reduce called the  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1249) Theologian and they were discussing  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1251) philosophical issues as as an uh as a as  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1255) a tool of intellectual Terror and  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1257) essentially what he means what he  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1259) invokes is points revealed and hamper so  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1262) Allah  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1264) that's the reality so this is all  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1267) deceptive these names are deceptive  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1269) because they sound very nice the  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1271) predecessors  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1272) uh old people think that previously you  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1274) know people have a tendency to nostalgia  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1277) the past was good if you ask most people  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1279) in England how it was the time of your  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1281) fathers was much better we are now  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1283) suffering prices are high at the time  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1285) you you know the benefit you the weekly  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1288) benefits have been like in that I was  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1290) here the same thing because some  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1291) relatives and they have neighbors  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1293) English neighbors living on benefits the  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1295) benefits with five pounds per week they  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1298) were living lavishly more than today  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1300) with a benefit of 100 or 120 per week  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1303) associate was willing for five pounds  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1305) this one people are nostalgic so they  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1308) always imagine that the past because the  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1310) the president is having its problems and  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1311) they're suffering the past held also but  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1314) it's forgotten now and only the nice  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1316) thing remaining the nice memories  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1317) Nostalgia so it appears to that  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1321) it's a piece to that but there's nowhere  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1322) in Quran also any praise for the  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1324) previous one  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1325) most likely there is usually a displace  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1328) or disapproval a previous one like  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1330) saying We are following the ways of our  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1332) father and grandfathers and the Quran  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1335) says even if if the relation comes to  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1337) Muhammad is more guided and more  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1340) rational than your grandfathers and  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1341) fathers even your brings better things  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1343) than what you have for me and they still  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1345) insist stuck through that so even you  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1348) could say going back to the Center for  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1350) sticking to them  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1351) is actually not the spirit of the Quran  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1353) Sunnah yeah but what about the uh Hadith  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1356) which talks about the best of me are the  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1358) ones after me uh that's what I said  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1360) that's what I said best generation the  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1362) whole generation but in the generation  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1363) of assalam was also a group of the West  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1366) tyrants in Islam in in human history  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1368) abujah and so on the Veron of this  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1373) in his generation meaning the whole  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1376) generation as a total and what makes  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1378) them best  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1380) as I stated earlier what makes the  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1382) sahaba especially that's not the one  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1383) meant obviously he doesn't mean the  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1385) kofara Polish definitely does that means  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1388) and the Roman Empire definitely not  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1390) they're not the best of human being but  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1392) the best of of generations who follow  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1394) the prophets that's that has to be  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1396) restricted but let's assume the best of  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1398) all Humanity fine what makes them the  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1400) best  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1401) because they have the thousands of  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1403) companions who accelerated to Islam and  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1406) they will were willing to sacrifice  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1408) wealth and life for Islam and they were  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1411) sincere  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1415) he does not mention that they are more  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1417) intelligent and more sophisticated a  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1419) better industry that's not what makes it  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1421) better  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1422) what makes it better is these features  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1424) and these features are not related to  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1425) matter of understanding the Quran Sunnah  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1427) or or uh claiming that what they have  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1431) stated in certain situation is the  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1433) correct is the correct statement no not  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1436) necessary they could make a mistakes  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1441) even various places in the Quran there's  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1443) a relocation even the battery you got  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1445) the cream of the cream  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1447) the first to accelerate to Islam up to  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1450) the day of Badr are called The sabrielle  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1451) Promise Paradise yeah  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1454) the cream of those are the rule of  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1456) butter even the real bad have been  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1458) rebuked because they gave them a wrong  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1460) advice about the issue of of taking uh  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1464) taking ransom for for the detainees in  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1467) violation of the injunction that transom  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1470) should not only taken after the enemy  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1471) has been crushed down  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1474) and they get the advice because they  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1475) wanted the booty they wanted the the the  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1477) money coming from from the Alonso and  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1480) the Quran fast  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1482) foreign  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1488) and he said you you want to Dunya you  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1490) did not give the cesare advice  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1492) because you want to Dunya this is the  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1494) battery so they could have even in this  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1496) not have some feeling  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1498) so it's very important to recognize and  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1500) and particular sahaba in this slide to  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1503) everyone makes it feasible around to  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1505) strive I can't compete or come close to  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1507) them at this but if you have them like  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1509) engines who have come down and you may  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1511) ask yourself do they really where they  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1513) go into the toilet where they defecating  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1515) and urinating yes they were maybe maybe  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1518) the edification was smelling like like  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1520) musk no it was smell bad  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1523) like I was so this way they come closer  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1526) to us and we can't really strive to come  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1528) similar to them in piety meaning in  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1530) sincerity and willingness to sacrifice  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1532) wealth and life for Islam that's what's  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1535) right  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1536) intellectual issues and discussing the  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1539) explanation of Eye of Quran no so so  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1542) basically you just to recap so you're  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1544) officially saying that there isn't the  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1546) things that they agreed on were already  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1548) they disagreed on loads of issues of fit  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1550) in terms of comprehension they aren't  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1552) necessarily the oldest would have the  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1554) strongest comprehension I'll give you  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1556) two examples for the comprehension two  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1558) examples for for the the the faulty  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1562) completion sets and situation we should  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1563) not be there was something in the in in  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1566) the tribe of ashari the ashari tribe is  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1568) the one joined the person who was in  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1570) hybrid the best Islam they joined Jaffa  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1572) coming from Abyssinian that's in the  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1574) beginning of the uh sixth year I think  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1577) the beginning of the sixth year end of  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1579) the sixth year we deliver seventh year  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1580) when the prophet finished  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1583) then he got away with March towards so  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1586) he went to immediately fine  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1590) uh he was communicating with the najashi  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1592) to said Jafar and His companion who was  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1595) staying there about 15 years  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1597) as a Islamic Reserve but also carrying  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1599) it down there and carrying it down to  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1600) India and China many people do not know  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1602) that and on the way they were joined  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1605) with some of the tribe of ashari  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1607) the ideology that's someone who from the  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1612) tribe established that ashadi ideology  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1614) or theology  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1615) that's right they joined together and  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1618) they came to to tribe and the process  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1620) was so elated to see Alpha that he asked  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1622) the Muslim to give them some of the moti  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1624) ETC of these stories are known  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1626) one of their personalities something in  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1628) the tribe happened which you should have  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1630) prevented to having or commanding good  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1631) and evil or something I don't remember  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1633) what has happened maybe another  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1634) narration narration did not mention and  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1636) the Lord said ask him why didn't you do  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1639) Taria why didn't you change the mankar  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1641) and the man answered  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1643) because Allah said  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1650) concentrate on yourself you will not be  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1652) we mentioned that interfere by the way  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1654) it will not harm you those who go astray  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1657) if you are guided and our son was angry  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1660) said where did you go lost  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1663) how can you be lost and understanding  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1665) the eye and he said holy Quant Arabic  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1667) Arab man and a Believer and the one who  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1671) is just arrived After High but so he  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1673) participated in many battles after that  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1675) possibly in conquist of Makkah Etc  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1678) this is for the kofar because the word  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1680) Dal usually means go take out getting of  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1682) the way into Comfort nobody unless you  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1684) have other evidence that means making a  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1686) mistake  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1687) so this is foreign  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1693) just focus on your Iman and establish  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1695) your Iman that's the meaning of the eye  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1697) so he did not understand it this way  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1700) another  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1701) there was someone African who left  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1703) Madina broke their immigration and  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1705) joined the the Hostile comfort  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1707) and they were they're passing in under a  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1709) covenant to security with someone who  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1711) has a covenant with the Medina and this  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1713) is have over disputing about what to do  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1715) with them kill them not kill them  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1716) because they joined the Arabic Cafe  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1719) was silent  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1721) and the Quran foreign  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1733) now they are passing there with a  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1735) Covenant security and they have the  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1737) Covenant security just apply to them  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1738) disabled of the citizenship they belong  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1740) to  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1741) how it's a problem  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1745) it should be obvious  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1749) so there's two events and many other  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1751) events like that happening at the time  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1753) of the Prophet so it's not not matter of  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1755) going so this is the fallacy but it is  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1757) present at such a way to companion  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1759) there seems to be angels  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1763) coming from Heaven this is from another  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1765) world they don't they were not living  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1766) there maybe they're not even walking  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1768) maybe they were flying in the air and  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1770) things like that but that's where you  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1771) have an imaginary picture of something  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1773) which is not real with the with the  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1775) purpose intent to pass my own statement  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1778) and my honest they had all my own  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1781) misconceptions as the one coming from  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1783) their self  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1784) in reality it is not coming from itself  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1786) and even discovering themselves it must  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1788) have been disagreement about that  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1791) check but here's another thing I mean  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1792) there's one thing about  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1794) silk  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1795) what they tend to record on the market  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1797) on is around the issue of Akita so what  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1799) they're obviously the  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1801) Theta Vida and obviously obvious of that  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1805) great version but the thing is this so  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1808) by building so obviously for us belief  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1811) is a fundamental component you know to  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1813) be a Muslim one of the fundamental uh  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1815) aren't having the right belief so they  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1818) just obviously  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1820) again there's a fallacy developed a  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1823) history and the people swallowed it down  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1829) talk about Iman  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1832) Iman is not just Akita a set of reports  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1836) which you you believe they are true no  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1839) that's not him this is yakim and this  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1843) has nothing to do with the Iman ifs is  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1845) the base of the Iman you have you have  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1846) to do translinkual things which have  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1848) come from Allah or dictated by the  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1849) system of reason  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1851) but that's not  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1852) you have to accept it and make your life  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1854) according to it Daniel you are done you  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1857) are movement before that you are just  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1859) Musa for example read the Quran who  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1862) talks about the people of course  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1871) they have absolute conviction this is  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1874) the truth but they reject the same  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1876) what's going to follow us a couple of  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1878) slaves  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1879) and that Nation slaves under us which we  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1882) can Slaughter our kill as well and take  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1884) the woman with ever for servants or  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1885) whatever and and then two of those come  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1888) and claim to be messenger of God and we  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1890) are supposed to follow them no that's  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1892) what they said although this is wrong  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1899) let's say it's a convention  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1901) scholarly conversation okay actually  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1902) that is what the heart has been about  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1904) from not the heart is not enough is  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1908) convicted about that that's not enough  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1909) it has to be more to become Iman but  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1912) let's go to that what's that shall be  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1914) noted about  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1915) is that what allow order to know with  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1918) statitute in the Quran says  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1924) no it's attitude that Allah knows  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1926) everything and is comprehensive in  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1928) knowledge  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1929) it's capable of doing everything  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1931) knowledge no will certainly do this and  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1934) this and this the Quran did not leave it  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1936) open and another place is specified what  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1938) should be believed on  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1940) for example foreign  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1952) he has gone astray far away so these are  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1955) the the main portion of Iman  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1958) but nobody disagree with Muslim there so  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1960) they they they got stuck or got involved  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1963) somehow and secondary issues of  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1966) uh related like for example what's  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1970) really  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1972) Allah created the heavens in six days  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1974) and after that he mounted the throne  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1975) what does it mean mounted  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1978) uh  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1980) some people said it can't be the  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1982) physical reality because Allah is our is  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1985) outside as a space he cannot be located  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1987) in a place and that's impossible  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1990) because if he can be in a place he must  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1992) be in every place otherwise you'll  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1994) notice is existing  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1997) and then they indulge in these things  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=1999) this is maybe a philosophical discussion  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2000) should not be a matter of Akita yeah  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2002) maybe Scholars can discuss that in  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2004) Academia but you should not even ask  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2006) Muslims common Muslim to to have an  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2008) opinion they say  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2010) just just take it as it appears and if  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2012) you have a mental image whatever mental  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2014) image come in your mind like someone  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2016) sitting on a chair this is just your  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2018) your limited imagination as a human  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2020) being and you are forgiven Allah phrase  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2022) this way so that you can have this  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2023) imagination in your mind but know Allah  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2025) is different but that's enough for  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2027) common people how do you drive at that  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2028) conclusion for example how do you derive  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2031) that because they build a narrative in  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2034) terms of this is what you must know  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2035) Muslims must know this place  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2038) that's inventing that's not what the  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2040) Quran made an injunction  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2048) and you come casually to it for example  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2051) that the wife of an azizian of Egypt uh  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2054) tried to seduce Yusuf this is a fact  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2056) this is the fact she tried to reduce  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2058) user and he almost fell but he recovered  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2061) and ran away fine if you say no that's  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2063) not true you are a cafe because you have  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2065) declared the Quran to be false but is  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2066) that part of the Akida should they stand  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2068) in the door of the mosque and ask you do  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2070) you know what the wife of uh did to  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2073) yourself  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2076) obliged to know that but if you come  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2078) casually fine you don't put that in  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2080) arcade books even if there are Akita  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2082) books it doesn't mention this or they  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2084) should be in that according to the  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2085) division  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2086) they got stuck in problems which their  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2090) ancient School especially  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2092) were not qualified to study  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2095) because the people of Hadith and  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2096) narration  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2098) but they gave certain answers which are  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2101) most likely false and they want to  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2103) connect that ID and declare your deviant  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2106) of this service that's it that's what  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2108) they wanted that's what has happened to  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2110) it  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2111) that's what happened with historical  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2113) so that's what they care now if it comes  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2115) to check now the hobby is having the the  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2118) tool of shark  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2121) and the main thing which is they have  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2122) the the the financial himself for  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2124) Muslims on the starting actually the  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2126) problems started with intermedia but not  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2128) that extreme and sharp not like it was  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2131) like a knife but it was not sharp yet  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2133) not sharpened enough to be to be deadly  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2136) half shaft that went to the extreme  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2139) follow the consequence to its end so his  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2142) his consistent with himself more in that  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2144) epitaphia epidemia is  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2148) the conclusion is that is that ibada  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2152) um  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2154) is a certain list of Acts like for  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2157) example that will help you to the  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2158) following me that greeting the banner  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2161) when the banner is lifted or the  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2163) national anthem is is a is sound for him  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2167) in England people stand for example  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2169) there's a certain procedure and they  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2171) sing with it  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2172) or if you see the banner especially if  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2174) you are a member of the military then  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2175) you're supposed to give strike put like  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2177) this and give a certain greeting they  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2180) say that for a week standing in front of  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2182) the banner in a specific way  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2184) showing respect and so on is that  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2187) natural rebada and you are worshiping  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2189) the banner and you are a mushrika and  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2190) the cafe  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2193) so the act of what they call Active  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2195) worship or this ritual  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2198) they declare to be everybody and if it  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2200) is directed to someone else beside Allah  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2202) it is  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2209) because when they get to sujured they  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2211) got stuck in the problem  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2213) that the people the the family of Jacob  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2216) is a prophet under them  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2219) to yourself when they entered Egypt of  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2223) greeting  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2224) how come the sujood is one time greeting  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2226) and so on well what makes us greeting on  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2228) that greeting and they got stuck  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2230) every day definition is fundamentally  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2232) for policy and based on that they  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2235) invented what they call  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2236) these people are worshiping Graves  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2239) foreign  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2247) Islam  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2251) based on the 40 definition  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2255) so even that they missed and their  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2257) definition it is not really in cover but  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2260) we don't take care of the capital  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2261) because the the fundamental principle is  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2263) that if you have a certain point of view  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2265) which necessary doesn't mean that you  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2268) are a Catholic because  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2269) that maybe you know you're not aware  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2271) that it is couple you did not do the  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2273) necessary logical steps but it's but I  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2276) am at able to tell you your point of  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2278) view result necessary and comfort  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2281) because if you defend worship like this  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2283) acts meaning if you direct that up to  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2284) the banner for example you made the  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2286) banner identity beside Allah that's it  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2290) you adopt the god beside Allah so  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2298) identity is something which is worshiped  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2301) that's his definition  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2302) that meaning Allah was not worshiping  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2305) Eternity for any creation so he was not  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2306) a deity in that  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2308) which is  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2310) but they never think this way but if you  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2312) show someone of them this way they will  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2314) stop and start wavering and knowing what  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2316) they say I hate to tell the people that  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2318) your point of view is ending and cover  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2320) but sometimes you are forced to say that  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2323) they are  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2332) not qualified to do these conclusions  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2336) so can you explain a bit more so  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2339) for them Anila is something that is  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2341) worship and in the absence of it being  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2343) worshiped it ceases because the  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2346) definition earlier they haven't they  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2347) haven't expressed it as such as  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2352) almost here I would say he's lying  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2355) deliberately because even Tamia doesn't  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2357) say that and all Scholars are even  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2359) linguistic people agree on that that's  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2360) what he says  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2361) by the way it's not interested but it  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2364) comes later  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2366) with a quote on the reference and the  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2368) books are everywhere they cannot even  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2370) hold it back and erase it from the books  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2374) that's its definition  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2377) Which flies it's essentially giving a  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2379) slap to the Quran because the Quran  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2380) defines exactly what he lies  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2387) there are two types of villa  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2389) says  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2397) it says Allah has no son that's a report  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2400) there are other reasons to prove that  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2403) Allah is impossible to have a son but  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2405) enough to say that Allah is reporting  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2406) you claim I have daughters and children  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2408) Offspring I have an offspring  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2411) actually is an offspring it can be  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2415) female or male Allah has not offspring  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2418) and he has no reason to lie about his  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2420) own F3 which we had  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2421) and there's another attitude with him  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2423) otherwise the other deity will take its  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2426) own creation and depart away that's the  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2428) definition of Allah the one who can  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2429) create and take his own creation and get  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2431) away or try to dominate the other one  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2434) the one created by your own internal  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2436) probability  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2437) and can dominate the others or Shield  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2440) them  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2442) or an offspring of  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2445) string of the spring of saturated in  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2448) programming you are a programmered  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2450) acrosive definition it goes ultimately  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2452) is the entity which can create  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2455) by its own power  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2457) has its own creation as in the Dominion  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2460) of creation and can Shield it take away  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2462) from anybody else or dominate someone  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2463) else  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2465) foreign  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2475) you have taken that and put it in the  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2478) bin  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2479) I'm using very very harsh language so to  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2482) shock The Listener to think about that  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2484) seriously what would that mean I mean  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2487) to for for that to be an exclusive  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2489) definition wouldn't he had to say illah  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2491) as in some way some way to say that this  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2494) is this exclusive definition  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2497) there's no deity except one which is  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2499) have in Arabic the name Allah  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2503) Allah sorry what I mean is that by  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2506) saying that an illah is a is something  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2508) that is worshiped is that the exclusive  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2510) definition the only thing that he  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2512) considered to be a constructive  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2513) difference yeah that's right and that's  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2514) and the studies even here the only thing  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2516) he said he said he says for example  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2519) about about the the the the uh the uh  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2524) the Dome or the on top of the grave of  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2527) al-bada in Egypt he's taking the weather  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2529) as an example it was very famous and the  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2531) people go there and have celebration  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2534) Etc he says this is an idol fight say if  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2538) you ask Al badawi for help on the or or  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2540) cure Etc and so on then you made him  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2543) Allah not illah Allah  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2546) you identified him with Allah  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2549) that's his exact words  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2553) this man is is gone in such a way that  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2556) is a bug's imagination  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2558) and is as unbelievable that people but  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2561) we will not worry of that time all  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2563) almost 100 illiterate very few Scholars  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2566) and he was able to to to to cooperate  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2569) with one one guy in Power who's sneaking  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2571) enough and and mischievous enough to  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2574) recognize this opportunity to have  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2575) someone who's so obsessed and willing to  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2578) kill people and fight for that and can  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2580) extend my power that's Muhammad episode  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2582) let me I usually say in Arabic could be  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2585) a very nasty language  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2587) so obsessed that he sang to the level of  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2590) Donkey and he was  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2592) I decided to ride that donkey there's no  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2595) doubt that a man is obsessed with the  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2596) idea it tooks all his life and all his  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2598) imagination occupied him completely  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2602) and he got the opportunity of support of  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2604) someone who regarded as an excellent  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2606) opportunity  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2608) let me give you a following story when  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2609) he had arrived in the area after his was  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2611) expelled from Mariana  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2614) also worked with him initially but  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2617) Ronald received a threat from the from  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2619) the Osmani uh Wadi in eastern region to  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2623) whom this was belonging  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2627) it's a midwin area the central power in  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2630) Istanbul and even the Eastern region in  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2632) the mom of the haran now called the  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2634) mamadhara actually  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2637) they will not battle very much but he  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2639) still belongs to them  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2643) outside  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2645) but we come to that later  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2648) so he the ruler of the Eastern region  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2651) form of sort of threatening a letter to  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2654) uh to uh  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2656) uh for one reason because  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2661) a stoned she admitted and stoned assume  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2665) that's correct no problem with that but  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2667) stoning and the executing is a matter of  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2670) the of the government  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2672) so it seems it looks for for the  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2675) governor of  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2676) that  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2679) they have user power and they'll make a  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2682) decision who should be made by the  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2684) government at least by the way or by  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2686) Istanbul  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2687) not here

[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2694) because you cannot like for example if

[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2697) Someone putting in prison then you

[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2754) conversation as narrated by a book which  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2757) is now represented and we have have in

[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2774) something I was living in the area  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2776) myself when I was there  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2779) I told him

[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2853) in the dialect of we expect from any  
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2855) ignorant man like Muhammad to be talking  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2858) Dale if you'll not be talking in Arabic  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2860) like some reports try to translate this  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2862) statement High Arabic and they will say

[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2866) as you'll support me through defeating  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2868) shirk  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2870) continue  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2876) let Mr Jose what a great gift from  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2879) heaven  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2880) this man is busy demolishing Graves and  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2884) I'm busy extending my power  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2885) and that's what had happened from that  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2887) day  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2888) recently by the way although this is not  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2890) an Evidence  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2891) there Ambassador in London you may have  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2893) it the segment he said he said who said  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2895) we have anything to do with religion we  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2897) are we are a tribe which won the wars  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2899) defeated the others uncut all things my  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2901) religion is just what was at all he  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2903) admitted that's him  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2912) English media  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2914) so don't regard us that the guardian of  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2916) Islam I think that this is all  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2919) meaning that's always fake it was just  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2921) too good we actually won the war and to  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2924) establish power and convince the  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2925) population to obey and not Rebel  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2927) religion was a very good tool that's it  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2930) that's it  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2941) reporting that  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2943) yeah but what in terms of him what was  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2946) his Machiavelli reason to even express  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2949) that talk so he said from the man  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2951) something okay just occasion it says  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2963) how can you stay here  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2965) meaning tell me something give me some  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2968) solution  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2969) oh the solution came  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2972) does this tie into the mentality whereby  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2975) take currently for example also  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2978) they can round up people put people in  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2980) prison every river everybody  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2984) that's the founding of the state when  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2986) some people say what happened some  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2987) people there's a fabricated what could  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2989) it and I think by some Shia Scholars  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2990) claiming that they've been having  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2993) himself is a British agent and there was  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2995) a British spy called Jefferson or

[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=2998) confessions if the moment you open the  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3000) book and read a few pages it's means  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3002) yeah publication there's no doubt about  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3004) that I can't even write a details about  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3006) that if necessary but they know that and

[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3010) is your application that's nonsense the

[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3058) government because this is a very  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3060) excellent tool for control but I have  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3063) fishes to check that he will not  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3065) interfere with my income and money and  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3067) the illegitimate taxation which you know  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3069) just a legitimate it's known to everyone  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3071) this terrible taxation is a legitimate  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3074) and then he goes to him with this fatwa  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3076) and then the alliance was was made  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3079) based on approving that that will  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3082) continue yes you support the hate

[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3093) a condition does not entail that  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3096) Muhammad cannot kick him out the

[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3110) that's just a promise I support you that  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3112) was enough for him he doesn't see  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3114) anything else  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3115) just to understand the character of them  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3117) person  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3122) going to extreme until exactly like now  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3124) dash because they have set their  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3126) intelligence in their mind  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3128) they are the the confused by anyone  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3132) they're blind  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3133) dream isn't blind to you blinds you  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3136) does not let you see the way  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3139) so basically this whole insistence on  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3141) shirk you rebuttal because of the  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3143) fundamental definition of shook yeah  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3146) in full in Arabic the path is translated  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3149) actually only the introduction part  
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3151) which because the the reason for This  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3154) calamity to happen is that his osule and  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3157) the way he load but you cannot blame him  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3158) very much because at the time and this  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3160) time Islamic scholarship was at the  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3162) bottom  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3163) Islamic scholarship was increasing and  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3165) advancing until let's say the fifth  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3167) Islamic Century roughly with more  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3169) elaboration and development then slowly  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3171) it started stagnating I said maybe three  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3174) four centuries and same level up to even  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3176) tell me and afternoon  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3179) just just  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3181) collecting things but nothing really  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3183) creative even few creations with Emir  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3186) are not that genuinely creative and then  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3188) after that started declining  
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3190) genuinely declining  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3193) until the bottom of the time of  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3195) hamburger so you cannot blame him that  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3196) that he is no no he is at the end of a  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3200) declining period after a stagnation and  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3202) after the development of scholarship  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3203) which was starting to become deviant  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3205) after the time of sahaba anyway  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3208) so you cannot believe me but that's a  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3209) reality  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3210) his osun the way he looks at Quran Sun  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3213) the way he reads it is with half-blind  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3216) eyes  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3218) so that's the reason the book of the  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3219) head we have these three first chapters  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3221) try to clarify that for example  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3223) principle going to the bottom of the  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3225) absolute necessities of of of of uh of  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3230) reason and perception and also the  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3232) necessity of the Quran only that most  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3234) fundamental and pressing Necessities are  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3237) directed there then we discuss later  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3239) than the evidences of prophet told us on  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3241) and then about the issues of and  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3244) worshiping grievance on so the other  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3247) thing that they kind of  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3248) um hang their Appeal on is the issue of  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3252) better and  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3256) this entire insistence of having purity  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3259) of Dean so this Creed okay and then  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3262) there's the acts themselves  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3264) almost because because  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3272) this is the reason it's believing that  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3274) Allah has messenger  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3277) Etc even that it is  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3284) essential that's it but all the details  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3286) there are many Hadith about details of  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3288) of how accounting would be in your  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3291) Mercury you're not required to believe  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3293) in them if you pass on them Ayah okay  
[0:54:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3295) then you will believe them automatically  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3296) because they they have goodness now they  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3298) seem to be authentic that's it  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3304) these secondary questions about is the  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3307) Quran created not created uh what is the  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3309) mounting the throne that's what they  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3311) declare Akita and put it as a part of to  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3314) read and play a game with that to the  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3315) people that have a cool their mind you  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3317) have become an issue when did this  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3318) become an issue and how do they are how  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3320) how would you rebuttal that the the  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3322) articulation that is is an issue and  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3324) it's because it's related to create  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3325) because because clearly it was not the  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3327) issue of the time that they claimed the  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3328) sale of sahaba they never discussed that  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3331) because they understood that everyone  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3333) understood his own way as a Canal's  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3336) imagination and they understood that  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3338) they understood the general principle  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3339) that Allah is different than what if I  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3340) imagine but whatever imagine is okay  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3342) according to our limited human  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3344) perception full stop stay there that's  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3346) it they didn't need they didn't have any  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3348) need to discuss and go in this issue  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3351) barely there may be 102 issues related  
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3354) to what is the course one or two  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3357) narrations that's all that is there  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3360) that's it and nothing else about that  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3363) they were disputes about who is Muslim  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3365) on the cover and what gets you are the  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3366) problem of Islam when the time of sahaba  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3368) by the qawal that would dispute that's  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3370) the beginning but not least what they  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3372) call it  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3373) but they usually call it rapidly  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3375) especially their own Akita which is the  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3377) defining the Divinity in a in a  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3380) definition which control  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3388) so that's that that's it  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3389) that's part of the problem so for  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3391) example take the issue this is more  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3395) important than Sharia you have to have  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3397) the correct Creed  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3398) and the view will confuse Creed with  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3400) Iman all this mixed up becomes then a  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3403) major issue pushes not matter it's not  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3406) even secondary  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3407) okay so so the issue that they make they  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3410) fixate on life example the hand the  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3412) Cursi there's no requirement at all to  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3414) to extrapolate that or to have an  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3416) adoption on that absolutely no  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3417) requirements that's cleared another  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3418) equipment  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3421) when they use the word  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3423) is it usually they they use it on the  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3426) issue of creed and they also use it in  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3427) related to actions so for example  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3429) Millard birthday of the Prophet various  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3433) things again on a fundamentally that  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3436) what whatever this Harbor did not do we  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3439) should not do which is completely even  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3442) whatever the prophet did not do we  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3443) should not do because we're not doing is  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3446) nothing nothing comes with evidence for  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3447) anything nothing is is a fundamental  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3450) logical flow  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3453) so I can understand for example actions  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3456) results  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3458) action and leave it the only you think  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3461) you can conclude that by the necessary  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3463) visa and by the old overwhelming  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3465) narration is that that what he has left  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3467) cannot be cannot have been obligatory  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3469) that's all of it it may be still  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3471) desirable lifted deliberately  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3474) did the deliberately leave it to uh to  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3479) show that it's not obligatory it could  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3480) be desirable it could be play mobile it  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3484) could be undesirable it could be Haram  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3485) all these four you have to have extra  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3487) evidence for that  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3489) that's if he has done an act and left it  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3492) if he has done no act at all like for  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3494) example  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3495) he enabled he never uh  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3500) planned or or tried to to to to build  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3503) the rocket to go to the Moon  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3506) because it it was not given at his time  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3510) can you conclude that building located  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3518) would you apply it to such odd cases in  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3521) normal cases they can play they say he  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3523) did not celebrate his his birthday  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3526) the only thing you can say for that yeah  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3528) it's not obligatory  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3530) that's all  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3532) but if they frame certain things as  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3534) being but in fact he prayed the one day  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3536) as you say this is about Monday fasting  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3538) Monday because this is my birthday  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3540) that's the day I'm born so in things  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3542) that the day is born is a nice day worth  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3544) of celebrating by fasting or whatever  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3545) celebration ending but he did not do  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3548) and also the Arab tradition in the other  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3550) position there was no celebrating your  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3552) birthdays while other nations celebrate  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3554) birthdays  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3556) so showing that SSA is a assembly  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3560) assembly uh you cannot conclude from  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3563) that you have to have other desert  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3564) someone could say based on that he  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3566) present Monday passing on Monday because  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3568) he said Monday is the day I am born on  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3570) the meaning Monday is a good day we're  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3574) celebrating with Siam but his birthday  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3576) is also worth celebrating because he  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3578) made that a good feature of Monday  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3582) so you may conclude from that that is  
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3583) maybe desirable disability of his  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3585) birthday even if he doesn't maybe he did  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3587) not get celebrated so that it doesn't  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3589) break it came an injunction and burden  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3591) to his ummah then they go through the  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3593) excessive exactly like the case with the  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3595) discussion going around between some  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3597) Sunni and Shia  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3599) Etc or some Shia and Sunni  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3602) as a matter of fact he started Torah we  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3604) had started even the Masjid  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3606) and then more people came more people  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3608) came then he decided it's becoming  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3610) dangerous now so he stayed home  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3612) and they came with it I started Wiki  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3616) sound that we are here ignored them at  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3619) the end and the last day they thought  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3622) even Stone against his daughter was very  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3624) angry  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3625) and he said you all must have caused  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3627) Allah to make obligatory on you I  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3630) abstained from doing it so it doesn't  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3633) may become obligatory  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3635) when the best player besides after  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3637) fariba is the one the one who you pray  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3640) at home  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3642) you see the point and then people said  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3644) after that because of that some people  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3645) she has it it's a bit of almost no it's  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3648) not Buddha because after the part passed  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3651) away there is no danger of to become  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3652) obligated  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3654) now we can do the nice thing and bring  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3657) the people and have an Imam who is good  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3659) in with a good voice and eating and even  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3661) having an Imam for men and a man for  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3663) woman because the Masjid was very big  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3665) and they couldn't hear them but they  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3666) didn't have microphones at that time or  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3668) megaphones so I said so his problem was  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3670) not better it's a very good act  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3673) as a very good act  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3675) just to give you an example but the  
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3678) problem is the Also let's go to the  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3679) fundamental soul  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3682) that he did not do something or even  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3684) left something after doing  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3686) in the case of tarawi has very clearly  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3688) breaking through in Jamaica in the  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3690) Masjid  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3691) is because he was concerned that it may  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3694) become obligated on them  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3696) and the junction May Come From Heaven  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3698) making to obligatory  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3700) and he did not want to have too many  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3701) applications I wanted to make it easier  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3703) as much as possible  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3705) like for example the habitualism was to  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3707) do with every salad to do and the day of  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3709) concrete  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3711) in the morning and one morning because  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3714) he stayed several days before going to  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3716) Africa  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3718) and then  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3719) and Lord he did not make and pray to God  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3722) and also  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3724) messenger of Allah he did something I  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3726) have never seen it you do it before  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3730) you did not make odor foreign  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3747) there would be some dumb people like  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3748) that  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3750) to break that he would did it one day  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3752) show it it's not obligatory but he  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3754) prefers to do what do for more Purity  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3756) for more beautification for calling  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3759) whatever is it  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3761) obligatory  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3765) do you see the fundamental issue that  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3767) was only they have faulty also there is  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3770) not Hadith conclude something based on  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3772) on face value another Hadith they  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3774) conclude something in the Third how did  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3775) they conclude something  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3777) and they didn't put them together and  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3779) they don't go to a fundamental principle  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3780) alcohol which is enshrined by necessity  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3782) of reason and Quran and Sunda like the  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3785) same for example not only say I will  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3786) have you but many of us and they show or  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3789) basically uh ruling of permissibility  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3796) the basic learning of action thoughts  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3799) and everything is permissibility  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3804) for example some Scholars I don't know  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3806) the names would argue that if you  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3808) repeated a certain act and you  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3811) incorporate into your your your worship  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3813) and you consider it to be recommended or  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3815) something of that nature that makes it  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3817) into a bidder  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3818) if you if you make it recommended  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3820) without any evidence  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3827) like for example you you you can very  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3830) well celebrate at the moment of the  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3831) neighborhood yes it's certain Arabic  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3833) tradition he did not say about it  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3835) celebrated for whatever reason so it's  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3837) definitely not obligatory but he Praises  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3839) Monday being said that's the day I am  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3841) born in meaning is a blessed day if the  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3845) Monday is blessed in the week then the  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3847) day he is born  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3848) or supposed to be born because the day  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3850) the people that live now is almost  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3852) certainly the wrong there I have some  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3854) work for that but that's not our issue  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3855) today  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3856) is almost certainly the wrong day  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3859) but still  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3861) they assume it is being the day and they  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3864) celebrated as an occasion  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3867) I say the first place that had regarded  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3869) as a blessed day you can celebrate  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3873) so as long as it's framed in the road  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3875) because you have an argument the other  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3877) one is purely  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3880) making a uh with absolutely no evidence  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3883) like for example taking that profit  
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3886) usually may God offer every Salah will  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3888) she showed that is not obligated you see  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3890) but it is even better and more desirable  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3892) and closer to Allah foreign  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3898) not even one hint  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3903) you see my point that's it that's Rida  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3906) but the other one is not better because  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3908) the possible point of view and the  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3909) argument is actually structural and well  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3911) well established it's a good argument  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3914) did not do it it's not that partition  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3918) they were busy with Jihad did not come  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3920) in their mind keep in mind with the  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3922) people later  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3923) so this recession about Buddha is being  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3925) well firstly framing something is bitter  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3928) and then making it such an overwhelming  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3930) issue  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3932) which almost you know overrides shedding  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3935) blood this is this indicate a mentality  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3939) which is going extremely religions which  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3941) is very destructive  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3942) prohibited that and then occasion which  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3945) is shocking you know the story now let  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3947) me repeat the story in his in his final  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3949) uh uh pilgrimage just few months before  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3952) he died  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3958) and also another I think uh  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3963) they were mounting behind the prophet in  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3965) exchange sometimes they alphabet  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3967) sometimes they'll have battle so taking  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3969) that it was my turn when it arrived in  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3972) in Muslim  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3975) and then we set down you know it was  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3977) there before you set down because they  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3978) depart on camel back and then coming  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3980) back you don't have a traffic jam  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3982) because Cummins was killed to go up with  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3983) the warranty and so on and the number  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3985) was also limited that time nowadays if  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3987) you depart with cars we get stuck you  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3990) are happy tradition was dead from Before  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3991) Dawn I will not get any opportunities to  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3994) happen but at the time they went so we  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3996) settled there  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=3998) and before going to sleep I think I've  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4001) been working that project I think we'll  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4002) go to sleep as a precaution if not even  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4004) us select for me uh Stones so on so much  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4008) most likely for every day it's like  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4010) almost daily from the stones that is  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4012) more than nice  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4016) but in that place  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4018) I selected small stones which are like  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4021) the size of chickpeas  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4024) very small  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4026) and they put in his hand he was amazed  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4028) about  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4029) while  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4031) this is maybe the right to the right  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4034) size for nice management and putting a  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4036) big number in a bag I think it's a baby  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4038) that's right okay  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4039) and the people around him also visit we  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4042) were around him continuously to learn  
[1:07:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4044) from him to get advice to get  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4045) instructions to get guidance  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4048) on the filters maybe the last pilgrimage  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4050) so they have to get opportunity to soak  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4053) as much as possible from the knowledge  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4054) coming from Heaven through him  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4058) and then to the people say  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4060) like with this size  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4063) dostoning and then he make a statement  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4066) which seems to be shocking seems we are  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4067) related to this small Silverstone  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4071) don't go extreme in devotion indeed din  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4075) here means the dayun being devoted being  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4077) religious don't call Extreme because the  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4080) previous nations were destroyed by going  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4082) this extreme empty  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4085) because you may think I am going to  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4087) Stone the devil  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4089) I think I saw Stone so so is hostility  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4093) and hated more  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4094) um take a big Stone and the next time  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4097) you take a bigger Stone  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4099) and the next time to recover the machine  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4101) gun and then you kill the people think  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4102) about that's not what develops that's  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4104) all of the game would lead to your  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4106) destruction  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4109) couldn't you have a counter argument in  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4111) the sense that is the fact that people  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4113) incorporate other rituals  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4116) is what's leading to Hulu so for example  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4118) no no no the argument is faulted  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4124) now now you show if they come with that  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4127) argument say we have this Hadith showing  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4130) he's saying clearly had a farm with this  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4133) size  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4137) and avoid and a Saturday avoid going  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4139) extremism indeed  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4141) because the previous things were  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4143) destroyed  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4144) and the only occasion he said previously  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4146) will destroy it is this one and another  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4148) one that they they punished the the poor  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4150) and the lowly and leave the rich and the  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4153) noble from punishment  
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4155) and the equation of cutting the hand of  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4157) the Jose Jose  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4159) and he said even if Fatima committed  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4163) and another two other occasions of what  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4166) we destroy another one is that they were  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4168) asking to their messenger and going back  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4170) and forth with questions and  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4171) interrogations so they missing you that  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4173) destroys Nations  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4174) Etc then four or five you can you can't  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4176) even you can't even search in in any  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4179) collection of Hadith and so on with the  
[1:09:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4181) word  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4183) then you will find four or five types  
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4186) that's one of them and the example given  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4188) is clear it's not increment in English  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4190) but it's exaggerating the size of the  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4192) Stone  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4194) foreign  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4199) people from around the world  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4201) even from Arabia itself but the river  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4203) they tend to be a little bit better  
[1:10:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4205) educated about that especially Egyptian  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4207) they're very hot devoted and so on  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4210) at the astonic site some of them take  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4213) their shoes and throat at the Devil  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4214) you'll cause me to divorce my wife  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4217) and just you need to mess with the shoe  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4219) and hit someone in his head  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4220) you are lucky if you don't plug his eye  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4222) out  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4225) and if it comes a general habit or  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4226) integrating everything  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4228) between to destruction  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4232) ultimately it's that simple but it will  
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4235) grow because the mentality the obsessed  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4237) mentality that's a small pious  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4240) so in some in some ways this whole and  
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4243) so a good parallel for this one another  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4245) example there is an example of that one  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4248) time in a battle campaign the part of  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4249) those fasting usually he doesn't faster  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4251) without a trip  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4253) in a comment and then the sun just sank  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4255) just barely suck and the Horizon is  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4258) burning  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4259) with light  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4260) and you say to the one driving the camel  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4263) stop and let us go down and do us for a  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4265) drink  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4270) say stop I tell you stop and they said  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4272) why like whoa on you stop and start  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4275) doing the drink  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4277) because the man think I should wait a  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4279) little bit maybe five two more minutes  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4280) two more minutes that's more bias  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4283) and then it goes more and more and more  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4285) and more and more until you continue  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4287) until next sahore like some people try  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4290) it  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4292) so this is fasting fantastic  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4295) and who told them this is not the idea  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4297) so if you as I said I have a I have a  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4299) special I have a specialty but it would  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4301) Allah my Lord feed me something  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4303) spiritual for him but for you it's not  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4305) it's off limit  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4306) I understand Sam insisted and he faster  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4308) than them do you know how much how much  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4310) uh he did  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4312) he did it not only one night did the  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4314) seven days in a row  
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4316) after they collapsed  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4318) don't do it that's really especially for  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4320) me  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4321) but some people have this tendency think  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4323) it's more pious  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4328) that's all over the incomes  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4331) so the example of uh you know the  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4333) example actually that definition of  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4335) bitter and bigger it's cyber did not  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4336) that's all over D that's going to  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4338) extreme  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4340) what whatever did not do it who said  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4342) they will do everything reasonable and  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4344) nice until we almost get up  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4347) who said that  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4349) what they do that excelled with the  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4351) Quran said clearly they're truthful they  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4354) are spending they are sacrificing  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4355) themselves the cause of Allah ahead of  
[1:12:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4357) everyone  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4358) that's what made them like that not  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4360) anything else that's it read the Quran  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4363) from A to Z  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4364) you have to go back to the Quran and  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4366) read it you have to do the number of the  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4368) Quran you cannot just rely on one Hadith  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4371) here maybe one uh the highest maybe even  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4374) 40 maybe we not related completely go to  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4377) the one which is completely protected  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4379) the Quran from cover to cover to have  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4381) these more fundamental issues clarified  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4383) in your mind  
[1:13:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4390) you often give an example of uh the man  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4393) who came to the Masjid and the Hadith  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4396) which talks about the mass of shaitaan  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4398) yeah can you explain how this kind of  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4401) relates to this because that because on  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4402) this subject what they call it a Divine  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4405) drama or Divine Comedy like uh the one  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4408) of Dante but it's not a common sadama  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4410) oh you can't call it comedy if you want  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4412) uh um anything that is various channels  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4414) so most of them are weak but if you put  
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4417) them together and analyze them you will  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4418) come to the conclusion that once the  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4420) story must have been outtended for the  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4422) goal so we went Allah for some time  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4426) and we were talking about and then we  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4428) mentioned a man who is known for extreme  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4430) piety  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4432) and was frustrating in Jihad is not only  
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4436) and we mentioned heat is distant Empire  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4437) I don't know him I'll go to your  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4440) prescription I don't remember that now I  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4442) don't know  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4443) just let me comment here quickly that of  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4446) us have I don't know him meaning he does  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4447) not attend the Halal he's not gaining  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4449) knowledge  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4451) make a note on that and Allah put it as  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4453) Dex textbook now anyway we are  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4455) discussing this man and describing he  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4457) looks like that his bed is like that the  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4458) man came  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4466) they have a place of sitting near the  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4469) Bible or sofa in the back at that time  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4471) let's assume that all at that entrance  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4473) there far away from the end  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4478) this is the man we are talking about he  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4480) is he is coming and he first looked at  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4483) him say this one  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4486) I don't know yet but I see in his face  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4488) the strike of the devil  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4491) shocking  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4493) that's because the prophetess have  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4495) spirituality and receive why the others  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4497) do not see see only the external work  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4501) and then the birds want to teach them  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4502) why he has a strike of the devil  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4504) so when he came close he said Salaam I'm  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4507) saying  
[1:15:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4511) when you came close to this to us to  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4513) this group of sitting people  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4515) did you think in your mind that you are  
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4517) better than everyone here  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4519) maybe through the airport maybe the  
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4521) others at least let's assume that let's  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4523) let's give the man a better benefit of  
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4525) the doubt unlikely that he thinks it's  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4527) better than the prophet but  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4529) the man who is thoughtful say Allah by  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4533) Allah yes  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4537) now we know what this is  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4539) looking down on his Muslim Brothers  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4542) I do more I am doing more in the  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4544) battlefield I pray more  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4549) than he proceeded does he sit and ask  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4552) why you are asking me what's going on  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4553) why the strange question no no he  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4556) doesn't need he knows everything  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4559) he has everything already  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4562) showed that otherwise he would have to  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4564) be said imagine you get the opportunity  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4566) to pass at the messenger allow people  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4568) sitting and he asks you such a straight  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4569) question wouldn't you sit as I said why  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4572) are you asking me this question  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4574) strange question what's happening  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4576) it's something wrong with me no he  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4578) didn't  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4578) he continued doing the Masjid to the  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4580) front of the Masjid maybe behind the  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4582) wall or a character or something most  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4584) like the prophet was that was in the  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4586) back at a period of sofa people were  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4588) living in the machine doing Quran and so  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4590) on  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4592) Amazon I come to the people there almost  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4594) were there and Ali had saw and a few  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4595) others so it was really an important  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4597) Catholic  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4599) imagine he thinks it's better this  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4601) including Alia possibly even including  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4603) the prophet but let's say we will not go  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4605) to that extreme  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4609) a strange command or request  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4612) see who from you will go and kill this  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4615) man  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4620) is not Warrior you didn't say anything  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4624) until they know that all his life that  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4626) must be laid in in time because Abu Bakr  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4629) also reported that but in a mutilated  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4630) way so maybe in the ninth or tenth year  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4632) really and also awareness must have been  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4634) mature and old sitting with these people  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4636) because he started serving the prophet  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4638) with 10 years 10 years old will not  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4640) bother with six most likely must be 15  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4641) 16 17 quite late so what happened but  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4645) maybe why when something exceptional  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4648) so like I said I will do it there was a  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4651) go if you can so he went he saw the man  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4654) praying  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4655) and that he hesitated  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4659) this is all a Divine Comedy Allah  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4661) producing it visibly  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4663) because we at the end we know it as a  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4665) divide comedy he would not have been  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4666) killed because he's not worthy of  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4667) killing  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4668) be well but we'll do he says  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4674) I'm not I'm prohibited from killing  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4677) Muslim the one who pray especially if  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4679) that is now praying now  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4683) but this is the one who is playing right  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4686) now  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4688) so he went back to the messenger while I  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4689) saw him praying and you have prohibited  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4691) us from killing  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4693) numbers you are not the one for that you  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4696) are not the one very distant for this  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4698) one almost said almost said I will do it  
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4703) he goes and then pull the sword the  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4704) heads of w will dispatch with this man  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4707) he came and found almost upon him in  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4710) sujood  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4711) hey this is even worse the money is in a  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4713) student  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4715) the lowest the lowest body position  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4718) foreign  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4722) not only he's playing under Abu Bakr  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4724) hesitated is a good example I should  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4726) follow Abu Bakr he hesitated  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4731) we are not the man for him  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4733) and I said I let me go  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4736) but I said see what has he said to Ali  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4739) go you will kill him if you find him  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4743) if you find him  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4745) and then he goes in the man has finished  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4747) unquote  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4748) I came back said he's gone messenger  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4751) said  
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4753) their people this way of guidance  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4756) all of themselves Paragon looking down  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4758) other Muslims believing that they have  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4760) all the knowledge and reality they read  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4761) the Quran without digesting it that's  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4764) the first occasion or one of the king  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4766) said  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4767) and they will deviate from Islam or from  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4771) obedience and from the community  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4773) them  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4776) if you have killed him which is a puzzle  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4779) by design of Allah he would have the  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4782) first and the last of the khawaj but  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4785) it's not aware of the universe that's  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4786) not the way Universe have been started  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4788) the beginning as a testing Universe  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4790) could it be possibly have been killed  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4793) if you have killed him but it's if it's  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4795) impossible it's impossible you could not  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4797) have killed  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4798) because their history has to take away  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4800) and you have to be tested by hawaris  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4802) tested by monafithine tested by your own  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4804) desires you have to be tested now  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4806) tomorrow this these days in our  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4809) interaction now tomorrow there's no  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4811) escape this is Qatar fixed at the  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4813) beginning of the creation unescapable  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4818) anyway this show this now we know it's a  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4821) Divine Comedy  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4822) I like exposing to them like an act in  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4825) front of them  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4827) that man could not have been killed  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4828) because he's not pulling the sword  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4829) that's number one  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4831) the appropriate ordering him killing by  
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4833) wahi  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4834) either knowing or jibree  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4836) Allah knowing that he would not be  
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4838) killed and these people will fail and  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4840) also hinting that the one who will fight  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4842) khawaj and if he finds them  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4845) and is supported Hadith  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4848) we mentioned it's just to to give some  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4852) some some nice taste to our discussion  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4855) today and to give valuable value-based  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4857) virtual in this special regard  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4859) one time I'm still gonna say  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4861) one of you will be fighting about the  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4863) top wheel about their proper  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4865) interpretation of the Quran as I thought  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4867) about its revelation  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4869) notice the web it's the same way I  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4871) thought about the simulation  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4873) one of you will fight about its status  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4876) interpretation not about the video  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4878) people do not denying it with this but  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4880) they were entirely interpreted wrongly  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4882) and the same the way he's saying like I  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4885) thought tanzino we know the fighting was  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4887) also uh potential is unfallible and is  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4890) the correct way to doing it giving a  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4892) warning sending Messengers doing this  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4894) thing we don't we have that structure we  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4896) have even writing and this area which  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4898) will be very strong  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4899) so Ali will be doing it the correct way  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4901) in this regard not necessarily an  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4904) inheritance law not necessarily a matter  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4906) of selling a bike slips or she has some  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4908) factors which are almost manifestly  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4910) wrong no in this one it will be correct  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4914) so backup this is a great virtue that  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4916) you would be the one fighting for the  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4917) meaning of the Quran in the time which  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4919) is misinterpreted so it is Allah  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4922) no not you mama said me I want to be  
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4925) happy this great honor say no so who is  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4928) it then say the one who is fixing my my  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4930) son that and Ali was fixing the sandals  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4932) Allah stitching it  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4935) that's the one who do it it's the same  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4938) as the one who here he felt by the man  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4941) because he could not find it now that's  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4942) not the time to be found  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4944) so there's also a projection of the  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4946) possible future there which the history  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4948) have brought forward as a reality  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4952) but at that appointment is not that is  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4954) very true and so on this is important by  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4956) itself that is understanding the point  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4958) here is that  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4960) the mentality of demand  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4963) he doesn't answer the help of the  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4965) prophet  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4965) yes the Quran or do you think he has  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4968) digested it probably  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4970) because  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4974) you have to refer the Sunnah  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4977) in its totality obviously  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4980) and even even if you don't have a Sunnah  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4983) it had like a uh when Allah  
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4993) with the provision you read it and  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4995) digest it  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4997) and you read it all of it  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=4998) is  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5002) then if you go through it all of it  
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5004) interconnected it properly analyze it  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5007) consistently then if they logic in your  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5010) mind it must be of divine origin there's  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5012) only one Divinity there's a day of  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5014) judgment that's the address  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5020) but he is now looking down his Muslim  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5023) brothers are not willing even to sit in  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5025) with the prophet to learn more things  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5027) who she need as a companion who's  
[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5029) supposed to be carried that after the  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5031) prophet  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5032) he's not doing  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5034) observations so one observation here is  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5037) the fact that  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5039) um this person so for example you you  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5040) previously mentioned about the huarach  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5042) how they when it when it says that it  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5044) doesn't go deep in the throats you you  
[1:24:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5046) also you you made the argument that  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5049) southern is deep conviction deep solid  
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5052) in metaphorical because the southern is  
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5056) there is the place of knowledge like the  
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5058) database  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5059) the storage  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5061) heart is a metaphor for the center of  
[1:24:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5064) the CPU the processing unit the  
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5067) Consciousness the mind the also the  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5068) associated feeling and the way you  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5071) conclude things and causes things and  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5073) the knowledge goes in the sudden  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5075) people think it's the physical one no  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5077) it's a metaphorical one  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5079) and even if the Quran says it is it is  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5081) not it is not the the eyes which become  
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5085) blind it is the heart which is in the  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5087) chest meaning that metaphorical heart or  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5089) the spiritual heart in the spiritual  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5091) chest  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5093) so that's what the Arabic convention and  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5095) the third it fits with the like for  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5097) example if you if you detect for example  
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5100) or you do you are programming you are a  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5102) programmer or they're doing doing  
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5104) computer issues if you detect something  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5107) on the way to to do a service today to  
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5109) connect programs and you feel  
[1:25:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5113) you feel as if your chest is elated you  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5116) feel like it is on the chest  
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5119) it's in here but you feel the ease here  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5122) if you get a bad news you feel the pain  
[1:25:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5125) and you feel the pain in your heart here  
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5127) you feel it because of vagus but reality  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5129) is here I'm going still this time  
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5131) metaphorical wonders so that that  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5132) reflection with the people even some  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5134) people go into extreme things that  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5136) really the physical heart is there and  
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5138) then obviously refuted by Ultra heart  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5140) transplantation we know that when you  
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5142) transfer to the heart of someone who  
[1:25:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5143) died  
[1:25:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5144) the one who received the heart remain  
[1:25:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5146) the same person the same character and  
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5148) so on barely anything from the other one  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5150) will come we know that but that's  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5152) actually interesting so for example  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5154) so that's the chest the information so  
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5157) whenever  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5158) it doesn't go down through the circle  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5160) through the chest it doesn't become  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5162) knowledge  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5163) useful knowledge  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5165) sitting in the chest it doesn't  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5168) chewing on it that's it  
[1:26:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5171) is not digested because if it's digested  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5173) if you something goes through the throat  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5175) will go down then it's digest it and if  
[1:26:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5177) it's just the compound from the body in  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5178) the case of wood in the case of  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5180) knowledge or on  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5182) it goes in your chest as knowledge and  
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5184) understanding not just made bits of data  
[1:26:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5187) understanding correct understanding  
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5189) correct  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5192) getting the correct and the connected  
[1:26:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5194) Munich  
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5195) and then say there is the Quran not the  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5198) ayat or Quran the Quran the total Quran  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5200) and they still are unable to digest  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5202) because they don't do the correct  
[1:26:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5203) digesting tools even in fundamental  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5206) things for the Hawaii  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5209) yeah  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5213) we will come to that point because some  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5215) of the people currently are discussing  
[1:26:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5217) that issue Malik is there because they  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5219) relate to rulers and many of these  
[1:27:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5220) salafi and so on are agents either paid  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5223) agents and traitors  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5227) or many follower who think is is really  
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5230) a Pious man and guiding them to the  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5232) right way and the reality is he's a paid  
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5235) man he's an agent anyone person I met  
[1:27:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5237) him personally I discuss with him  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5238) personally  
[1:27:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5239) so  
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5242) what do I say yeah about it  
[1:27:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5245) suffered because the issue of of rolling  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5248) it seemed it's clear that they're  
[1:27:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5250) reading the Quran with the digesting  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5251) it's called the issue of ruling is clear  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5252) in the Quran  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5254) when they say  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5255) yes  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5257) but what's what's in which ruling is  
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5259) only for Allah because the Quran says  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5261) there are places we reveal the Torah  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5263) with guidance and light and so on with  
[1:27:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5265) which the prophets and the scribes and  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5268) the Rabbani rabbis  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5272) etcolors judge rule also so the prophets  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5277) and the scribes and they're all  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5279) so there's a ruling of profits and so on  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5283) the message  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5284) if they come to you to rule between them  
[1:28:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5287) meaning the Jews and their dispute then  
[1:28:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5289) you have the Liberty either you roll  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5290) with them and say no no you are an  
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5291) independent entity manage your officer  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5293) or or your issues if you choose to rule  
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5296) the rule with Allah has revealed  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5298) Injustice it's not Liberty you don't  
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5300) follow their desires you rule with that  
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5301) are everyday to you not what they want  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5303) you to worry about yours what I will  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5306) revealed to you  
[1:28:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5307) so there is a ruling of the messenger  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5313) which one is that  
[1:28:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5316) that's a question  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5318) for that if you have read all the Quran  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5320) you will digest have digested it you  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5323) would understood that that this ruling  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5325) is something else than what they  
[1:28:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5327) objected to alibner agreeing to have uh  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5330) arbitration it's not arbitration all the  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5332) Declaration was a political mistake and  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5334) Ali said if this is the trick but they  
[1:28:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5335) don't obey him okay fine but in the  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5337) village of that has nothing to do with  
[1:28:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5339) with the with violating it's ruling only  
[1:29:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5342) for Allah  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5347) a game  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5350) that we have to get to to write as men  
[1:29:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5353) who who make a ruling about what is the  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5356) equivalent animal animal of cattle or  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5358) the equivalent care expiration which we  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5360) discussed result in my area for example  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5365) for example  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5368) so it's a couple of observations  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5369) actually various two rulings to Allah  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5372) what is  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5375) they thought every ruling including the  
[1:29:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5377) arbitration  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5379) is is only for Allah no it's not true  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5381) Allah order to others  
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5384) so what is the ruling which is exclusive  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5386) for Allah that has to be said understand  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5388) our book of the year which is almost the  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5391) translation is almost finished I  
[1:29:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5393) understand  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5394) yeah yeah I think you are editing the  
[1:29:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5396) final version yeah  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5398) it's sorted out after a long deep  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5401) discussion invoking essentially a Quran  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5403) necessary reason we don't even use a  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5404) Hadith for that so if they have read the  
[1:30:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5407) Quran and digested it  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5410) they would have reached that conclusion  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5412) or a similar code maybe not as  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5414) sophisticated this one in our book is  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5416) sophisticated because I'm building on  
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5418) knowledge and discussion over 1400 years  
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5421) for God's sake that will make you more  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5423) sophisticated more advanced we develop  
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5425) things and let us say the 14th 15th  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5428) generation like a car of the first  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5430) International be most sophisticated and  
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5432) Polished than the illegals or go around  
[1:30:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5442) they don't get they got a pile of junk  
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5445) and in Detroit  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5448) themselves for the ummah and was able to  
[1:30:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5451) get away and I suspect that even more  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5453) how you penetrated them and instigated  
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5455) them and played with their work most  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5457) likely and they're very very many hints  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5459) indicating that he was playing the  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5460) string so bad the scene but that's not  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5462) our issue  
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5463) so part of that also because they think  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5466) they have with this blubbering and  
[1:31:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5468) reading just shallow reading they got  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5470) all their knowledge so they don't bother  
[1:31:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5473) about asking companies that asking other  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5475) scholar people so there's there seems to  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5478) be very close parallels in two respects  
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5480) with this individual and the wahhabi  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5482) movement so just to jump ahead slightly  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5484) exactly so for example the one thing is  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5486) you know you mentioned about the number  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5488) of Quran you see very clearly right now  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5491) in this current issue  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5493) what they do is they don't even  
[1:31:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5497) uh show all the Hadith related to a  
[1:31:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5499) given subject matter so for example they  
[1:31:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5502) build we're obviously going to cover  
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5503) this in a few minutes but they build a  
[1:31:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5505) they build a narrative about de facto  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5508) default position everyone agrees that  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5510) you can't rebel against a ruler you  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5512) can't say anything against the ruler and  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5514) then they build this narrative  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5516) while ignoring all the Hadith which talk  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5520) about when you turn the Quran before  
[1:32:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5521) that  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5523) the Quran before that because the Quran  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5525) where weather will admission the Quran  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5528) in only two places one place is the eye  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5531) of famous eye of buildings  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5532) so obey Allah  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5535) and obey his messenger with the  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5537) repeating the word obey because the  
[1:32:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5538) obedient messenger is separate and  
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5540) additional why because of Allah because  
[1:32:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5545) the machine is unvaluable we know the  
[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5547) message is not Allah he's a human being  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5550) he's not eternal  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5552) he's a female  
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5554) it will be recircuited for eternity the  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5556) hopefully all of us in Paradise but he  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5558) is not by his own essential being a  
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5561) necessary being so his obedience is  
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5564) essentially because he's reporting Alpha  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5566) life from Allah so this is like obeying  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5568) Allah obey obedience is saved clearly so  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5571) nobody is at Liberty when you see when  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5573) he receives the Hadith proved to be  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5575) authentic but possible to say no I'm not  
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5578) going to obey because it's not a Quran  
[1:33:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5580) no we are not that Liberty you become  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5581) Catholic this way  
[1:33:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5584) by this position the studies in the  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5586) Quran the extreme Quran you say the  
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5588) Sunnah by itself is not is not binding  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5593) yeah this is meaning if I hear it even  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5596) from the messenger  
[1:33:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5598) I'm not going to obey I obey on the  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5599) otherwise  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5609) without the word obey again meaning it  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5612) is a minor level it is just an appendix  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5615) and then after that the addition where  
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5617) they stop most of the time they don't  
[1:33:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5636) most likely from the from the context he  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5639) means mainly the dispute between you and  
[1:34:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5641) the rulers but also between you and  
[1:34:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5643) others is it loaded but the dispute here  
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5646) is focused morally not excluded but not  
[1:34:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5649) worth it so if you have this filter the  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5650) rulers  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5657) his messenger  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5659) if you believe in Allah of judgment  
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5661) that's the only way to go and this will  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5664) have the final conclusion the better  
[1:34:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5665) result another place where the other  
[1:34:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5667) upcoming is that  
[1:34:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5669) rebuilding and those those are those  
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5672) rumor mangas and so on by the way  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5676) if they receive any news about which  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5679) related to security and fear and War War  
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5682) and Peace like for example someone  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5684) coming from in the time past no nowadays  
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5687) impossible to happen almost likely but  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5690) in time past you may have you may  
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5692) expecting a caravan to come from champ  
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5694) for example for the goods you have and  
[1:34:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5696) you go outside maybe longing to meet a  
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5699) caravan outside Medina  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5703) we saw in the whole Horizon a gathering  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5706) of One Tribe or something with arms and  
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5708) so on with gear which shows it's maybe  
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5710) you were and they look they're advancing  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5711) it looks like they're advancing to  
[1:35:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5713) Medina so there may be a danger  
[1:35:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5715) and you know about it these rumor  
[1:35:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5718) mongers and these they take that news  
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5721) they sit in the master say there may be  
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5723) an army coming to Medina I like this and  
[1:35:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5725) so on Allah rebuking them for that if  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5727) they receive such a news  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5730) they broadcasted everywhere to show that  
[1:35:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5733) I'm knowledgeable I know or with the  
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5735) intent to make a Believers afraid and  
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5737) shaking and Confused what's going on is  
[1:35:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5740) there's an army coming  
[1:35:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5741) what they should have done  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5744) they should have referred to Allah  
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5746) messenger and the one in charge  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5748) then the one in charge will know how to  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5752) analyze that and take our approach  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5754) action maybe the Army is going as well  
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5756) maybe it will need to do a preparation  
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5759) maybe you need to dig up ditch they will  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5761) make the decision because they were in  
[1:36:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5763) charge they are responsible for one at  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5764) peace  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5767) that's the second place mentioned so  
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5769) this is the obligation and this is a  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5771) poor and peace security you have to  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5773) repair  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5776) nowadays there's no compatible case  
[1:36:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5779) possible except maybe you see a bag in  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5780) another train station it looks  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5782) suspicious  
[1:36:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5783) then you go to the coffee shop so there  
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5785) is a bug here people run away  
[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5787) that's not the correct Behavior  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5788) correlation call the police there is a  
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5791) bug it's suspicious come check it  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5792) because they have the tools and the  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5794) vocabulary to do it don't go to the  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5796) coffee shop or say people there's about  
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5798) maybe the one blown away  
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5800) causing confusion  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5809) your Danger  
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5811) so it's not a correct way the people may  
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5814) panic and some fold their break his neck  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5816) and so on causing a catastrophe  
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5819) the correct way is calling the authority  
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5821) the one who responsible for for security  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5823) and so for example and more than that  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5825) could happen like that but in this not a  
[1:37:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5827) complete Army coming there's too many  
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5829) satellites and observation posts there  
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5832) to detect that but something like that  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5834) it should be with this category  
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5839) in addition  
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5841) so the the is really care said if you're  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5844) a dispute about single reflector it says  
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5847) they might be dispute it could be  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5848) dispute and it may be a legitimately  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5850) dispute and had to be settled by  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5851) reference to other messenger  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5853) which is very structured the need for  
[1:37:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5855) the discussion is in our book about  
[1:37:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5857) obedience what the meaning refer to our  
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5858) lives meaning referring to an authority  
[1:37:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5861) which can make a decision being referred  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5862) to something like a constitutional Court  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5865) that's hinted there and if you analyze  
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5867) it correctly you will do that but leave  
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5868) this very Advanced spot but it hence it  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5871) possible so you could very well dispute  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5873) with the ruler you may have a good  
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5875) reason you may not have a good reason  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5876) some other authority like a court will  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5878) arbitrate about that so let's not hold  
[1:38:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5880) on  
[1:38:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5885) only pulling the sword and starting  
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5887) killing the people that's all which  
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5889) disputing the ruler even going into  
[1:38:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5891) civilian Disobedience reviews that go to  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5893) work is not reached it's just this  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5896) obedience could be just the right  
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5898) continuous it has to be arbitrated  
[1:38:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5899) according to Allah said  
[1:38:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5902) but if the one in children ruler reached  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5906) a level of of making cover  
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5908) and attacking the Deen  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5911) foreign  
[1:38:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5919) because you have no Covenant this in the  
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5922) eye is  
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5927) of the college and so on indeed but it  
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5930) applies also to the domestic rulers  
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5933) if they do the same  
[1:38:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5935) if they break the Covenant yes because  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5937) the ruler could not become a ruler  
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5939) unless has given a covenant or an oath  
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5941) that he will attend to the public Affair  
[1:39:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5943) and protect uh people's wealth money  
[1:39:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5947) life and so on and do not do not attack  
[1:39:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5950) the religion or undermine the religion  
[1:39:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5952) or violate the well-established agreed  
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5955) upon rules  
[1:39:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5956) but like for some allow usually we'll  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5958) come to user in a minute  
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5960) if he doesn't do that  
[1:39:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5962) and attack the religion by allowing  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5963) usually or by permitting a giving by  
[1:39:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5966) giving licenses in the Islamic domain  
[1:39:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5968) not outside Islam to Two Brothers  
[1:39:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5971) that he's he's fulfilled the Ayah  
[1:39:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5974) they have to fight them  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5976) because they have no Covenant anymore  
[1:39:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5979) maybe if you fight them they will stop  
[1:39:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5981) that when they start the fight so you  
[1:39:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5983) are pulling the sword against them so  
[1:39:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5984) now it's becoming serious but step back  
[1:39:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5986) I'm sorry I'm correcting then we can  
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5988) negotiate and go from there and start  
[1:39:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5990) correcting that  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5992) but without showing such type of people  
[1:39:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5994) disorder they will not stop  
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=5998) that they may stop them  
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6001) the Quran it's enough you don't need to  
[1:40:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6003) go to Hadith about obedience and the  
[1:40:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6005) recoverable showing cover and those are  
[1:40:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6008) practicing Injustice  
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6011) and those who would violate the Sunnah  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6013) fundamentally and the behavior of a  
[1:40:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6015) proper Imam Etc there are many I had it  
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6017) about it  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6019) this I mentioned  
[1:40:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6022) this application to quraish can they  
[1:40:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6024) argue in the context of the Qureshi and  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6027) so on that's fine but but the reasoning  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6030) is mentioned there  
[1:40:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6035) that's the reason for fighting them and  
[1:40:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6037) declaring them to the leader of  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6039) that could be applied also to a Muslim  
[1:40:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6042) locally who broke his Covenant  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6048) and established Justice  
[1:40:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6051) if he breaks that  
[1:40:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6054) and attack the religion by permitting  
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6055) usually for example and so on  
[1:41:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6065) because usually is act of War  
[1:41:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6073) your religion is BS it's not worth  
[1:41:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6078) we have passed that stage we are now in  
[1:41:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6080) possible then time  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6082) plus exactly  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6086) who says it's only the Qureshi can  
[1:41:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6088) behave this way  
[1:41:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6092) anyone fit because the diet gives a  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6094) description the reason for that  
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6096) if they complete their covenants of the  
[1:41:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6099) Oaths  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6100) religion  
[1:41:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6105) or declare to be false and it's not  
[1:41:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6108) applicable  
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6111) there these these guys were listed they  
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6114) are the leaders of corporal  
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6116) I'm not even invoking the Hadith  
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6118) said this Ayah all those came in the  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6121) context of quraish the people which  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6123) should be fought in this Ayah they have  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6125) not come yet they will come down the  
[1:42:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6126) road  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6133) at face value  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6138) because of these two things  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6142) that was of comfort and make them liable  
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6146) of being fought  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6149) because they have no no Covenant no I  
[1:42:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6151) might they broke it already maybe they  
[1:42:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6153) stopped  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6154) give you also the wisdom of fighting if  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6156) you pull the sword in front of his  
[1:42:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6157) people say this is serious now  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6160) the whole people are rebelling with the  
[1:42:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6161) sword I have to step back  
[1:42:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6164) and take a breath at least or I have to  
[1:42:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6166) fight ultimate about one if if I survive  
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6168) them until you finish him  
[1:42:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6171) if he stops and says the mistake I'm  
[1:42:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6173) going to correct  
[1:42:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6174) show us  
[1:42:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6176) close these these brothers close this  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6178) you're in the Islamic domain outside the  
[1:42:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6179) Islamic domain which is very easy and so  
[1:43:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6181) on that's very visible under the  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6182) description  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6198) may Allah  
[1:43:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6214) to be correct say yeah they are right  
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6217) they're saying that correct things or  
[1:43:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6219) help them in the in their in their  
[1:43:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6221) transgressions  
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6222) has nothing to do with me and they have  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6224) nothing to them his relation is broken  
[1:43:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6227) of Allah  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6230) had this clearly the Hadith  
[1:43:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6233) about Quran so on this is a lot of  
[1:43:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6236) college the amounts would be information  
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6237) satellite Etc  
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6238) and then he said  
[1:44:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6243) as long as they will be the reason as  
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6246) long as they if they if they  
[1:44:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6249) if they when they when they ruled they  
[1:44:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6252) roll with Justice  
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6253) when they promised the effect of the  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6255) promise and where they asked for Mercy  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6257) they show Mercy when they asked they are  
[1:44:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6259) not obliged to do much to start with  
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6261) they may be rough and harsh okay fine  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6264) but if they ask for Mercy In a  
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6266) reasonable Justified way they should  
[1:44:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6268) show Mercy and who even know doesn't do  
[1:44:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6271) anything of that  
[1:44:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6272) of these events for sure any other Imam  
[1:44:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6275) after college has expired from Irma then  
[1:44:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6278) Allah scares the case of his angels and  
[1:44:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6281) the case of all people will be upon them  
[1:44:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6282) thus Hadith is  
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6286) after that  
[1:44:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6291) which comes from three channels  
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6294) one form for one one from uh  
[1:44:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6297) one from um  
[1:44:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6299) and one from  
[1:45:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6304) foreign  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6309) were almost excluded because they were  
[1:45:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6312) narrated it says  
[1:45:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6315) on them that's fine no we know that  
[1:45:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6317) about that value if they don't comply  
[1:45:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6319) with these for three conditions  
[1:45:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6321) then put your sword on your shoulders  
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6323) and exterminate them perish them don't  
[1:45:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6326) let them  
[1:45:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6327) otherwise the whole life will will  
[1:45:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6329) degenerate into into operation and you  
[1:45:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6331) will become you will become lowly  
[1:45:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6333) farmers who are living from from plowing  
[1:45:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6336) the ground slowly from I just flowing  
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6338) the ground having no dignity no no  
[1:45:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6340) character no standing  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6342) at that time Farmers regarded as Lord is  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6345) like self like in the time that I was a  
[1:45:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6347) funeral time it's not that farming is  
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6349) except but profession but farm at a time  
[1:45:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6352) were regarded as the law when the one  
[1:45:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6354) oppressed no one submissive to the few  
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6355) the Lords  
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6359) otherwise you'll be hapless farmer  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6364) the one who plowed the grounds who was  
[1:46:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6366) just surviving and eating from that what  
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6367) they pull out that's it  
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6370) the Lords and the Kings and so on are  
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6372) oppressing them on  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6374) providing them like donkeys then you  
[1:46:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6376) will be like that  
[1:46:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6377) this narrative that the Madras have  
[1:46:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6380) trying to make it almost like an ichima  
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6382) and they try to you know say it's some  
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6385) kind of a consensus some kind of  
[1:46:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6387) overwhelming  
[1:46:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6388) is it does it have any basis how did it  
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6392) there's this one or two  
[1:46:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6393) not probably analysis and neglecting it  
[1:46:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6396) is a Hadith because even the Hadith  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6398) about obedience  
[1:46:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6402) does not support them and that's the  
[1:46:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6405) reason they say oh there's no government  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6406) we don't see any coverage usually it's  
[1:46:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6408) just a sin it's not government no my  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6410) dear friend  
[1:46:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6415) and one  
[1:46:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6417) with the following characteristic  
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6419) clarification what cover worth of the  
[1:47:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6422) Lower Side will be saying  
[1:47:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6425) unless he command you with an obedience  
[1:47:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6428) this obedience to Allah or Haram

[1:47:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6434) that you stand there I don't believe in  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6436) a God or  
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6438) I have become a Buddhist now that's not  
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6441) the color boy this is by with his play  
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6443) with that field or he loses that  
[1:47:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6445) Authority no we know that a capital  
[1:47:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6447) control of the Muslim that's fine but  
[1:47:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6449) that's not what Hadith means  
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6450) because the other form of related from  
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6452) outside  
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6454) but same thing it's saying  
[1:47:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6459) unless he commands  
[1:47:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6462) with disobedience to Allah with a sin  
[1:47:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6464) publicly  
[1:47:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6468) now allowing your uh usually banking in  
[1:47:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6472) the Islamic is not allowed even in even  
[1:47:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6475) the Confederation demand even in the  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6477) medium is not allowed because of the  
[1:47:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6479) Nigerian treaty even that would allowed  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6481) there he allows that  
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6484) foreign  
[1:48:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6493) publicly  
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6495) ordering we will not attach these  
[1:48:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6497) resource  
[1:48:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6498) or not to sue them in court  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6504) but these people are Jokers these people  
[1:48:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6506) are that's just the last of it and  
[1:48:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6508) that's the reason they they they they  
[1:48:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6510) they they play games with the Quran and  
[1:48:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6512) Sunnah and they hide most of it exactly  
[1:48:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6514) like that when it's condemns  
[1:48:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6518) when asked the Jews who revealed when  
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6521) they denied say but when their argument  
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6523) with one of the sahab I think and then  
[1:48:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6525) one of them said  
[1:48:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6526) say you see that what has come to  
[1:48:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6528) Muhammad is similar to come to Musa he  
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6531) said who told you that Moses received  
[1:48:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6532) the Revelation all these are all the  
[1:48:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6534) myths  
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6536) so that how blessed you scholar escaped  
[1:48:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6539) through denying the Revelation and Allah  
[1:49:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6541) asked him then who revealed in the Torah  
[1:49:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6543) to Musa said no no Revelation has come  
[1:49:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6546) to anybody  
[1:49:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6548) brought down the Revelation to Musa well  
[1:49:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6551) she brought down the generation you show  
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6554) some part of it and the rest you are  
[1:49:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6555) hiding from the public  
[1:49:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6557) who did that who revealed it it's Allah  
[1:49:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6561) revealed it all your history is based on  
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6563) that that elevation came to Musa and he  
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6565) got you after Egypt with all these  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6567) Miracles all your history is defined  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6569) this way  
[1:49:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6570) and now we denying everything because  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6571) you don't want to accept Muhammad you're  
[1:49:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6573) not going to get away  
[1:49:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6576) exactly happened to us with some scholar  
[1:49:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6579) starting on the ancient before even  
[1:49:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6580) Madras  
[1:49:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6581) unfortunately some Hadith Scholars  
[1:49:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6585) unfortunately very unfortunate but this  
[1:49:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6588) has happened with this we will expose  
[1:49:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6590) that in various ways already I hate that  
[1:49:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6592) but it has to be sometimes you need to  
[1:49:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6594) go to history and clean the messages  
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6596) accumulated  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6598) I mean this whole mentality of building  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6600) almost like this absolute consensus it's  
[1:50:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6603) not based on anything I mean how do they  
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6605) get nothing give you an example  
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6609) in his deathbed or that his son Abdullah  
[1:50:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6612) to strike Hadith not saying this Hadith  
[1:50:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6614) is bad they're more attention so it's so  
[1:50:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6617) his reasoning the morteza use it as a  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6619) reasoning  
[1:50:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6620) for not attending Juma what's the  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6623) headache with structure which is struck  
[1:50:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6625) at this in the in the initially the one  
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6627) the narrator of the Muslim from the son  
[1:50:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6629) Abdullah said there was a line on the  
[1:50:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6631) top at that time they they cross out not  
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6633) by Crossing through because above that  
[1:50:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6636) was their Convention of Crossing out it  
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6637) was crossed out he said but it's not it  
[1:50:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6639) crossed out but not least still the  
[1:50:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6642) wedding is there that is the famous  
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6645) will be destroyed by this some some  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6648) subtypes of quraish  
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6650) or or uh stupid uh young people of  
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6654) course  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6658) and the people were shocked so what we  
[1:51:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6660) should do with them  
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6662) what can we do with them  
[1:51:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6664) said if the people would have Heritage  
[1:51:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6667) would avoid interacting with them avoid  
[1:51:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6670) obeying them do a civil disobedience  
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6672) essentially those generalists like  
[1:51:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6674) essentially but use that at the salon if  
[1:51:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6676) they will spare it from them even depart  
[1:51:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6679) from the country the country for them  
[1:51:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6681) then they will collapsulated they will  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6682) not be able to do anything if the people  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6684) depart  
[1:51:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6685) this is the right medicine for for  
[1:51:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6687) aggressive and satanic governments just  
[1:51:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6689) general strike stay home the regime will  
[1:51:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6691) collapse no regime can survive  
[1:51:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6693) but if all people comply unfortunately  
[1:51:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6696) people do not comply so the medicine is  
[1:51:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6697) not effective  
[1:51:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6699) he gives you a medicine if it should be  
[1:51:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6701) taken right those you don't take it  
[1:51:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6704) I understand  
[1:51:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6705) is is this I am very doubtful that is  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6709) really that's his real motivation  
[1:51:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6710) because there's water that I use that as  
[1:51:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6712) a reason not to attend Yuma because with  
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6714) these bad imams I don't think so I think  
[1:51:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6717) the reason is that Hadith talks about  
[1:51:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6718) some types of courageous meaning and his  
[1:52:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6721) beloved possibly but this is judging  
[1:52:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6724) intentions there are people who should  
[1:52:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6725) abstain from that with that could but we  
[1:52:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6728) in the case of because so many Hadith he  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6730) cut and mutilated just too expensive so  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6733) we have we have the right to doubt  
[1:52:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6735) really his intention but even the  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6737) argument he used is a faulty and so is  
[1:52:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6739) stupidity in the understanding even if  
[1:52:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6741) they're used to avoid Juma  
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6748) the Hadith  
[1:52:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6749) what's that mean you had if they use it  
[1:52:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6751) what's the problem and they called  
[1:52:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6752) Hadith a bad Hadith and evil Hadith  
[1:52:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6756) and that's not one of the best you can  
[1:52:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6758) find in the whole world  
[1:52:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6760) Hadith until now  
[1:52:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6763) it's famous  
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6768) himself  
[1:52:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6771) plenty  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6776) if he gets to hear them nobody he  
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6778) doesn't hear them and when any of his  
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6780) narrate these things he put cotton his  
[1:53:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6783) ears or he goes far away so he cannot  
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6784) take it and is narrated by several of  
[1:53:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6786) his students  
[1:53:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6788) they think it's a virtue by the way you  
[1:53:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6790) get so blinded and admiring you Sheikh  
[1:53:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6794) that his blatant Falls become a virtue  
[1:53:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6798) in your life that's how how how  
[1:53:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6801) the devil can blind you  
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6804) and how you could blind yourself by not  
[1:53:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6806) by choosing the right Imam you're right  
[1:53:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6809) Imam I write Imam should be the Quran  
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6811) that should be your Imam  
[1:53:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6815) not anybody in the world  
[1:53:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6819) that should be your email and that's  
[1:53:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6820) what the father told her today for let  
[1:53:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6822) me asking about the previous so  
[1:53:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6823) therefore the specialist whatever  
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6824) million is the specialist  
[1:53:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6827) yeah we know that he's The Specialist of  
[1:53:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6829) faithan so we asked about you said he  
[1:53:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6831) said to himself we will ask about us  
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6833) about goodness how to build good and  
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6835) they're asking about evil because they  
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6837) want to avoid it I know evil will come  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6838) fit and will come there's no way that we  
[1:54:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6840) will stay in the high level of the  
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6843) Prophet that's that's not the nature of  
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6845) the universe this is a testing Universe  
[1:54:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6847) remember again this is not a paradise  
[1:54:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6849) that's where you are tested  
[1:54:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6851) they said with the time of the Prophet  
[1:54:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6853) but let's take a double private maybe  
[1:54:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6855) relatively easy and simple because you  
[1:54:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6858) have the unfaluable one protecting you  
[1:54:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6859) there and doing the job for you but if  
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6862) he is gone there's nobody is there  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6864) so we're asking for this kind of  
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6866) interview and yeah he asked after after  
[1:54:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6869) this child will be here and after every  
[1:54:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6871) question he asked  
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6873) Davidson Allah saidifa is  
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6879) will not benefit you what benefit you  
[1:54:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6882) learn the book of Allah and apply it is  
[1:54:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6885) better for you  
[1:54:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6886) three times then he said there will be a  
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6889) filter like that we should face it  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6891) towards the time of backup that is then  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6893) he asked and after that there's a  
[1:54:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6894) fitness say yeah the heart will not be  
[1:54:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6896) as few as they were before  
[1:54:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6897) but before that he warned him three  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6899) times to learn the book of Allah and  
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6901) that he asked his case then he said  
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6902) something after that say yes  
[1:55:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6904) don't waste your time they'll be fitting  
[1:55:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6907) after Fitness  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6909) and apply it is better for you and then  
[1:55:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6912) he tells the next one  
[1:55:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6914) is insistent to get more knowledge about  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6917) the economic Fitness  
[1:55:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6919) is the fitness specialist but every time  
[1:55:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6921) he reminds him three times  
[1:55:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6923) don't waste your time with this this  
[1:55:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6925) will not benefit you benefit usual land  
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6927) the book of Allah and apply it Allah  
[1:55:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6932) is better for you than this question  
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6935) about Fitness so which will come because  
[1:55:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6937) the system of the world is going to work  
[1:55:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6938) like that going to grind everyone nobody  
[1:55:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6941) will escape  
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6943) nobody will escape that's it until the  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6945) Dunya ends with that reward and the  
[1:55:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6948) sorting out not engineer  
[1:55:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6950) foreign  
[1:55:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6955) the whole Quran  
[1:55:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6958) learn it  
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6959) and apply it will be better for you then  
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6962) you will see the way  
[1:56:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6964) you don't need to have it behind but  
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6969) you don't need anything  
[1:56:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6972) The Book of Life Is Enough  
[1:56:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6974) even in the miserable English  
[1:56:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6976) translations  
[1:56:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6978) even in that there's enough guidance  
[1:56:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6981) there to protect you all from utmost  
[1:56:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6983) extreme failure at least yeah maybe fine  
[1:56:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6986) issues of inheritance and things like  
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6988) that need the most sophisticated  
[1:56:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6989) scholarship and the Hadith but will not  
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6991) talk about that those are the major  
[1:56:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6993) things that we have today results in  
[1:56:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6996) cutting your neck and destroying your  
[1:56:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=6998) life that's what it's about the problem  
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7000) I have today is is because of Petro  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7002) dollars and building this kind of  
[1:56:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7004) narrative exactly yeah  
[1:56:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7006) let me just mention that I mentioned  
[1:56:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7010) to to give what has happened  
[1:56:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7014) we had a participated in the pilgrimage  
[1:56:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7017) I think in the year 91 or something in  
[1:56:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7019) 1991 or 90 or something like that  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7023) and that here's something characteristic  
[1:57:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7025) happened is that  
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7027) it was full  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7029) as usual in the recent 20 30 years the  
[1:57:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7031) places full  
[1:57:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7033) and then they have arranged things like  
[1:57:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7034) that and the police was blocking the way  
[1:57:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7036) inside Arafat  
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7038) okay  
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7039) some Turks you know the Turks are hot  
[1:57:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7041) blooded and stuff tough heads they came  
[1:57:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7043) and it was blocked  
[1:57:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7045) and I told the police we were to go in  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7047) Arafat and they stubborn they don't know  
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7049) that is full then you can extend outside  
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7052) because you have to have a festival for  
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7054) that okay fine  
[1:57:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7056) and they say it's Alpha is full they  
[1:57:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7058) don't know you are lying the Turks look  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7061) here there's guard there we can go there  
[1:57:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7063) ultimately  
[1:57:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7065) long talk short sense they came down  
[1:57:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7067) beat up the police remove the blocks and  
[1:57:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7070) entered  
[1:57:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7073) they get my military to do something so  
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7076) the police got beaten up nicely that  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7078) time police  
[1:58:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7080) after Hajj we hear that story is under  
[1:58:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7082) what without percussions at the  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7084) discussion about that we were in a  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7086) gathering after Hajj we were in normal  
[1:58:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7087) clothing and everything  
[1:58:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7089) and the people say that I mean is in  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7091) this house of seriously let's go and see  
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7093) what he said and he was talking about  
[1:58:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7096) various things trivia things the same  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7098) I'll call them stoning and so on before  
[1:58:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7101) you know the never-ending Australia I  
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7103) stoned before this I did and they  
[1:58:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7105) settled by the prophet long ago he said  
[1:58:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7107) someone said a stone before slow take  
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7109) say do no problem do no problem any  
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7110) orders okay  
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7114) so I want to say this is this is this  
[1:58:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7116) talk is is trivial  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7119) addressing  
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7124) what has happened now  
[1:58:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7128) first of all blocking like that is not  
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7130) appropriate there's no need to block if  
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7133) Alpha become full the buses and the cars  
[1:58:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7136) will be will be backing up backing up  
[1:58:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7138) until the border of Alpha and then you  
[1:58:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7139) come and see everything back up nothing  
[1:59:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7141) can be done you have to stand there but  
[1:59:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7144) most people are ignorant that in that  
[1:59:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7145) case Arafat actually is extended  
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7147) overflow  
[1:59:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7149) up to accommodating any number but the  
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7152) people need a structure people like you  
[1:59:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7155) a massage like you should issues that  
[1:59:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7157) fight or with authority to solve this  
[1:59:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7159) problem so we don't get police breathing  
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7160) or particular meeting and both of both  
[1:59:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7162) have lost their height the weight of  
[1:59:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7164) their Hajj by this violence is a  
[1:59:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7166) place who has a time of Peace not  
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7168) violence  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7171) and also maybe you should advise The  
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7174) Authority that they should disable the  
[1:59:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7175) police otherwise that's not problem to  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7177) treat like that when you say that  
[1:59:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7179) Authority a man I don't know him at that  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7182) time looks like  
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7184) a lot without any abuse like a lot  
[1:59:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7189) smaller  
[1:59:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7190) the first impression in my mind that is  
[1:59:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7192) the rat not a human being  
[1:59:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7195) someone was asking about that he's told  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7198) before and God went back to stoning  
[2:00:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7200) before after learning some trivial  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7201) questions  
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7203) that attention was diverted I heard you  
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7206) this is celebrity by their dismissal  
[2:00:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7208) with this rat so after we left  
[2:00:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7213) who came and spoiled a meaty discussion  
[2:00:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7216) this is a little bit more meaty than  
[2:00:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7218) discussing High politics this is how to  
[2:00:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7220) extend Alpha how to manage the huge  
[2:00:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7222) numbers which is more worthy than uh  
[2:00:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7225) stoning before or after and so Before  
[2:00:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7226) Sunset after Sunset and so on it's valid  
[2:00:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7229) invalid should we repeat  
[2:00:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7230) she didn't know this this what you call  
[2:00:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7233) that say no this is  
[2:00:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7236) I knew him from writing before when I  
[2:00:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7239) wrote  
[2:00:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7240) a pistol about the coming of the forces  
[2:00:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7244) and argue that it's eligible to call  
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7247) them for this collaboration of quit and  
[2:00:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7249) so on I had a result went around  
[2:00:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7251) at the time the regime was I think  
[2:00:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7253) that's the reason I think it was 91 or  
[2:00:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7255) 92 that that happened the regime was so  
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7258) weak and then the disgraced that they  
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7261) didn't dare defend anybody so I got away  
[2:01:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7262) with this  
[2:01:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7263) but he responded in his in he made the  
[2:01:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7266) writing say definitely  
[2:01:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7270) defending against the attack of muradin  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7273) of the atheist meaning it is and his  
[2:01:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7276) theory by invoking the help of mushriki  
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7280) that's his book and he says unless Ali  
[2:01:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7283) says as well we don't agree with him  
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7284) which is that this is like this that so  
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7286) he's mentioned by Crystal there so as  
[2:01:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7288) there was an interaction intellectually  
[2:01:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7289) before that and this was a that action  
[2:01:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7291) face to face  
[2:01:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7293) and after that nothing good we hear from  
[2:01:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7296) him  
[2:01:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7297) as a matter of fact there are very good  
[2:01:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7299) evidence I don't say it's an absolute  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7300) evidence only where I can't make an oath  
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7302) on it but it's very strong from various  
[2:01:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7303) sources that they saw his name in the  
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7306) so-called Messiah the list of salaries  
[2:01:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7309) issued monthly and he was listed I think  
[2:01:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7312) with the rhyme of uh major so on with  
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7315) this with that Crown this one star two  
[2:01:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7317) star three star on the club I think it's  
[2:01:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7319) major I think major Captain something  
[2:02:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7321) like that in in the second police  
[2:02:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7324) so a man allows him to work as a spy  
[2:02:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7328) in a religion respiring is absolutely  
[2:02:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7330) prohibited I Leave You judgment about  
[2:02:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7332) him and this is called Scola  
[2:02:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7338) but this the other one is based on a  
[2:02:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7339) witness for someone who saw the Messiah  
[2:02:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7341) and I think the witnesses feels worthy  
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7343) as well but I couldn't make an author of  
[2:02:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7345) that but the other things I have seen by  
[2:02:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7346) Android  
[2:02:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7349) the money says is  
[2:02:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7354) so it's paid by money  
[2:02:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7358) I can't I I cannot say anything at this  
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7362) time  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7365) with the discussion with it and  
[2:02:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7368) diverting the issue is clearly that the  
[2:02:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7371) whole Markov of 15 they attend to  
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7374) Scholars simple-minded or scale or or  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7376) coward scholar even if it means they're  
[2:02:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7378) covered he admitted himself publicly to  
[2:03:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7381) many people that is a God and he doesn't  
[2:03:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7383) that day something or even buzzer so  
[2:03:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7385) it's not a coward but it's weak it's  
[2:03:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7387) just a message  
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7395) they attend to these Scholars and either  
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7398) put stupid questions so they get all the  
[2:03:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7400) the session wasted for nonsensical  
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7402) questions or uh or uh or they if there's  
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7408) any immediate discussion happens then  
[2:03:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7410) they cross me with with the with the  
[2:03:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7412) nasty question to divert that attention  
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7414) I just then deliver it it's intelligent  
[2:03:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7416) service work does not scholarly work  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7418) that's not people who think that they  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7420) will meet it when they Allah might be  
[2:03:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7422) questioned it doesn't look like that so  
[2:03:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7424) what they what they do is they they it's  
[2:03:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7427) red herricks basically red herring is  
[2:03:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7428) something of that distraction so another  
[2:03:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7430) one for example this fixation on bidder  
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7433) this fixation on so for example Builders  
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7436) are an interesting one so by them making  
[2:03:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7438) better or more today or for example is  
[2:04:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7441) another big one in terms of  
[2:04:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7443) um  
[2:04:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7444) it's based on their own beta of  
[2:04:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7446) definition of of uh of uh definition of  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7450) illa this is beta it's not a definition  
[2:04:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7451) of the Quran so they invented the  
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7453) definition  
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7462) then it becomes itself  
[2:04:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7465) honestly I'm creating definition as  
[2:04:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7467) there you can as a mathematician  
[2:04:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7468) mathematical definition as even a  
[2:04:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7471) scholarship you can't define something  
[2:04:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7473) division you give the correct definition  
[2:04:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7475) and so on but if we make that definition  
[2:04:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7478) declare is the deal that's the only way  
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7480) to go  
[2:04:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7481) that's number one or  
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7484) you you you're based on it something  
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7486) within then this definition then become  
[2:04:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7488) a better  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7490) if if it's not a correct definition  
[2:04:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7492) according to the Quran it is then  
[2:04:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7494) created and then declared to be a dean  
[2:04:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7496) and worse if it is contradicts the Quran  
[2:04:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7498) like the illah is the God is that the  
[2:05:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7501) worship the deity is the things which is  
[2:05:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7504) worshiped  
[2:05:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7513) in chapter 7 8 9 and so on and uh that's  
[2:05:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7518) a clear heresy obviously a person can be  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7520) excused by ignorance or what it may be  
[2:05:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7521) so all of that is  
[2:05:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7523) declaring that touching the graves and  
[2:05:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7525) visiting the people in the grave and  
[2:05:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7527) asking them for this asking for them and  
[2:05:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7528) so on they claim that is  
[2:05:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7532) that that naming itself is because if if  
[2:05:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7536) that has any standing we would have a  
[2:05:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7538) Hadith or a Quran mentioning worshiping  
[2:05:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7540) a game anywhere there's none whatsoever  
[2:05:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7542) the only thing they are related on is  
[2:05:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7544) that a faulty narration in bukhari  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7546) allegedly  
[2:05:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7548) we have proven that is also but even if  
[2:05:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7551) it is not bus allegedly that a lot which  
[2:05:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7554) is mentioned  
[2:05:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7555) is a man who used to be doing elect  
[2:05:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7559) kneeing the door and making like like a  
[2:06:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7562) sweet or some dish and giving it to the  
[2:06:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7564) whole Jazz for free and then The Story  
[2:06:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7566) Goes that that after he died they  
[2:06:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7569) honored his grave  
[2:06:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7571) but according to the Quran  
[2:06:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7575) to say that even if it rabba said that  
[2:06:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7577) relying on some mythical stories of the  
[2:06:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7579) Arabic the Quran says clearly  
[2:06:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7585) from beginning with the end discuss  
[2:06:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7587) various issues and then comes to Allah  
[2:06:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7589) Allah are female deities and the Quran  
[2:06:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7593) is clearly from the beginning to end  
[2:06:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7595) nothing is female in that Surah  
[2:06:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7598) except Allah all these females and the  
[2:06:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7601) female deities clearly  
[2:06:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7604) and they are supposed to be the the  
[2:06:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7606) consort on the the the offsprings the  
[2:06:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7609) the daughters of Allah  
[2:06:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7611) ascribe daughters to Allah female why do  
[2:06:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7614) you don't like female girls  
[2:06:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7615) come why is Allah supposed to have  
[2:06:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7618) daughters and you are do not like  
[2:06:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7619) daughters  
[2:07:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7620) and the Quran rebook that in other  
[2:07:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7622) places but in this Surah Allah is  
[2:07:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7624) something female a female deity  
[2:07:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7627) so they took that 40 narration which is  
[2:07:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7629) not a Hadith from it who could being  
[2:07:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7632) wrong could believe this mythical  
[2:07:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7634) stories of the Allah  
[2:07:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7636) it's definitely fabricated against him  
[2:07:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7639) but assume is from him he took that and  
[2:07:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7642) structurally give the Quran Islam on the  
[2:07:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7644) face  
[2:07:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7649) taking even though that's the old thing  
[2:07:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7652) ever in that all Narrative of Quran and  
[2:07:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7654) Sunnah and narrative about the Arabs  
[2:07:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7656) behavior and so on which it talks about  
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7658) Graves and honorary grave all the  
[2:07:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7660) natives about honoring graves in the  
[2:07:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7663) Arabia area is only that the grave of  
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7667) tribal shifted is regarded as a refuge  
[2:07:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7669) if you go there then the sons of the  
[2:07:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7671) tribal shift 10 will protect you from  
[2:07:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7673) any prosecutor so it's like like a like  
[2:07:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7675) have a sanctuary has nothing to do with  
[2:07:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7677) anything worse with it  
[2:07:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7679) and even some people thought if we get  
[2:08:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7681) buried the prophet is not discuss how  
[2:08:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7683) we've created him outside in in bhakia  
[2:08:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7686) outside our control someone who have  
[2:08:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7688) committed a crime may come and said hold  
[2:08:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7690) in the grave say you cannot touch me I  
[2:08:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7692) mean Sanctuary so we bury him rather in  
[2:08:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7695) the machine which is continuously under  
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7696) our supervision that's one of the  
[2:08:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7698) discussion made in the death of his  
[2:08:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7701) death and was the reason they made it in  
[2:08:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7703) the Masjid or in the house of Aisha  
[2:08:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7705) which is next to the Massachusetts under  
[2:08:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7706) control nobody will will abuse it  
[2:08:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7708) because the house of action who can  
[2:08:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7709) enter is Haram to enter she's under  
[2:08:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7711) hijab so that that excluded so that's  
[2:08:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7714) the Habit that I don't know about grapes  
[2:08:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7716) and the famous gravey would you like  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7717) that the grave of tamim and maybe two or  
[2:08:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7720) three Graves were known to be Sanctuary  
[2:08:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7722) for someone running away taking  
[2:08:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7724) protection has nothing to worship  
[2:08:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7725) anything  
[2:08:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7726) someone taking just a sanctuary's  
[2:08:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7728) protection like nowadays some people run  
[2:08:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7730) in certain countries which have respect  
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7732) for the churches  
[2:08:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7734) there are in the church and at the  
[2:08:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7736) moment in the church nobody will pursue  
[2:08:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7737) him inside they're waiting for them  
[2:08:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7738) outside to come some countries still  
[2:09:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7740) have this tradition and some Muslim has  
[2:09:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7742) that for the Masjid  
[2:09:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7744) unfortunately it's not very common for  
[2:09:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7747) the Muslims for the holy Sanctuary  
[2:09:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7749) should be like that  
[2:09:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7750) by very prophetic injection  
[2:09:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7753) I think so this is true that's all  
[2:09:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7755) what's there about grapes so from this  
[2:09:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7757) from nothing exhale you they created  
[2:09:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7759) deity and worshiping Graves and  
[2:09:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7762) declaring 85 percent of Pakistani are  
[2:09:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7764) Railway and barely worship Graves and  
[2:09:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7766) their Muslim craft  
[2:09:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7769) for example to attack the Ottomans and  
[2:09:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7771) all this kind of stuff but partly  
[2:09:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7773) because of that yeah  
[2:09:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7775) also and the other thing is about um  
[2:09:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7777) using this issue of bid up maybe someone  
[2:09:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7780) looked at it it's also being used right  
[2:09:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7783) this moment in time to not discuss with  
[2:09:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7785) them so for example  
[2:09:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7787) um  
[2:09:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7788) this is an open forum and it's actually  
[2:09:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7790) open to anyone we've this anything that  
[2:09:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7794) comes out of this we are willing to have  
[2:09:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7796) open discussions on Zoom with anyone  
[2:09:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7799) everyone bring it on  
[2:10:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7800) they won't allow you in their forums  
[2:10:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7803) yeah but what I'm saying is establishes  
[2:10:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7806) following bid out again is that  
[2:10:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7807) listening to them study and the Deviant  
[2:10:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7809) may may spoil your heart and get you to  
[2:10:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7812) become whatever like him so the best  
[2:10:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7814) thing is to do like the people of new  
[2:10:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7816) when they treated no way put put plugs  
[2:10:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7819) in their ear and cover their clothes  
[2:10:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7821) like this  
[2:10:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7831) plug your ears under  
[2:10:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7834) which is the opposite of the Quran it  
[2:10:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7836) made an injunction to everyone  
[2:10:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7840) of understanding and insight they listen  
[2:10:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7843) to everything anyhold any statement  
[2:10:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7846) and they follow the best out of it they  
[2:10:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7848) recognize what is true what is good and  
[2:10:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7850) check the other one the only thing  
[2:10:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7852) prohibited is only one place and  
[2:10:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7855) reminded in Madina shows in accident  
[2:10:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7856) Mecca if you see they are sitting and  
[2:11:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7862) rejecting and mocking rejecting  
[2:11:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7865) the right way foreign  
[2:11:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7878) but not if the eyes of Allah and this  
[2:11:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7880) Revelation are being mocked  
[2:11:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7889) okay then we discussed with algorithm  
[2:11:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7892) but not very smokery then it has become  
[2:11:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7895) the the comedy session well  
[2:11:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7897) entertainment that's cannot be Quran and  
[2:11:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7899) Sunnah and Allah and his messenger are  
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7901) often with entertainment  
[2:11:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7902) absolutely what is that where did they  
[2:11:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7904) come up with this don't sit with them  
[2:11:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7906) all this I mean it's it's sustainable  
[2:11:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7908) scholarships that's what they're in the  
[2:11:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7910) Quran Quran says listen to every talk  
[2:11:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7913) if you are man of reason  
[2:11:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7914) or you say I am not having enough loop I  
[2:11:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7917) will not listen  
[2:11:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7918) I'm not able to select but saying is  
[2:12:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7920) prohibited you don't do don't sit with  
[2:12:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7922) that and they even this scholar said we  
[2:12:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7924) are not going for example  
[2:12:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7930) they said I'm not going to give him a  
[2:12:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7931) platform to spread his bit out to the  
[2:12:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7933) whole of the world  
[2:12:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7935) relying on what some scholar and time  
[2:12:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7937) passed Ahmad will happen so you don't  
[2:12:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7939) say to each other don't discuss with  
[2:12:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7940) them a reality he knows deep inside that  
[2:12:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7943) he will not be able to win any debate  
[2:12:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7944) with khaliliary from the debate  
[2:12:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7948) they invented that this is an invasion  
[2:12:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7950) invented I think one started inventing  
[2:12:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7953) this way way of thinking and this advice  
[2:12:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7955) is the second generation like people  
[2:12:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7958) like ayubus diani and so on  
[2:12:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7961) Hadith  
[2:12:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7968) to the tune that one of the students he  
[2:12:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7972) had heard that our one famous  
[2:12:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7975) full of Nations  
[2:13:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7981) from Amish which  
[2:13:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7984) is  
[2:13:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7986) so he went to Obama and I told him  
[2:13:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7988) listen I hear that you collected the  
[2:13:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7990) Hadith from  
[2:13:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7992) from Amish can I take a look to them so  
[2:13:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7994) you say yes and he took the Hadith and  
[2:13:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7996) follow them in the in the oven burning  
[2:13:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=7998) them what would you like to take  
[2:13:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8000) someone's work and burn it in the oven  
[2:13:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8002) and to add inside to injury  
[2:13:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8004) someone else  
[2:13:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8006) I'm not sure which one or both of them  
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8010) what they did who did that but I did is  
[2:13:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8013) the right or wrong says he did right you  
[2:13:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8016) should do the same  
[2:13:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8028) you are doing well so they encourage  
[2:13:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8031) people to take other people who are  
[2:13:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8032) writing and box and burn them  
[2:13:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8037) foreign  
[2:14:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8056) Ty that's that's his behavior a  
[2:14:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8060) narration is no doubt about that he is  
[2:14:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8062) but anything else  
[2:14:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8065) any reasonable point of view in a  
[2:14:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8067) rational discourse is nil  
[2:14:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8070) so you could be very well first class in  
[2:14:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8072) a narration and the exactness  
[2:14:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8075) until in any understanding  
[2:14:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8078) I'll give you a simple example  
[2:14:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8080) take a recording device MP3 recorder and  
[2:14:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8083) record our discussion it will recorded  
[2:14:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8084) more metically than bukhari or anybody  
[2:14:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8086) in the world but ask a device to give  
[2:14:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8088) you an advice about the medical issue it  
[2:14:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8090) can't has no mind  
[2:14:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8092) you're being an excellent recorder does  
[2:14:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8094) not mean that you have any might  
[2:14:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8096) but have confused I think those Hadith  
[2:14:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8098) recorder on imams of Hadith  
[2:15:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8101) no they are not  
[2:15:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8103) some of their blatantly deficient to the  
[2:15:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8106) level of experimental retirement  
[2:15:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8111) also in terms of the setup I mean if  
[2:15:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8114) it's more of a solid than ever been  
[2:15:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8116) handled yeah technically unless there  
[2:15:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8118) isn't all of them or these of this  
[2:15:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8119) category the attacker hanifa declared to  
[2:15:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8121) be in narration week and in matter of  
[2:15:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8124) piety and then to be either deviant or a  
[2:15:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8126) kaffir  
[2:15:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8128) many of them have declarative  
[2:15:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8131) is much more serious I think  
[2:15:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8144) or a guardian or a supporter Ali is also  
[2:15:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8149) a supporter he said don't ask about that  
[2:15:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8151) and don't mention it again  
[2:15:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8154) instead of explaining him what is the  
[2:15:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8156) meaning that's not what the meaning the  
[2:15:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8158) Shia thinks well she's well structure  
[2:16:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8160) all but you need to go to the Quran and  
[2:16:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8161) scan what the meaning of that mawla  
[2:16:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8164) there may be seven eight ten minutes and  
[2:16:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8166) you can't exclude one and one by one  
[2:16:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8168) with meticulous exacting World which I'm  
[2:16:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8170) doing now at the moment  
[2:16:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8171) the only one remaining is that anyone  
[2:16:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8173) worthy of support and can is is the  
[2:16:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8175) messenger of Allah is if anyone is  
[2:16:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8179) supportive and and willing to sacrifice  
[2:16:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8181) and support them Allah which every  
[2:16:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8183) believer should be then he should do the  
[2:16:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8185) same for Ali  
[2:16:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8186) we should do it for every believer  
[2:16:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8188) that's Allah Allah everyday but the  
[2:16:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8190) alliance of Ali is a higher rank the  
[2:16:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8192) same like Alliance of the product the  
[2:16:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8195) same with the other Hadith said that  
[2:16:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8196) whoever insults are insulting the  
[2:16:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8198) prophet if I insult you this is the sin  
[2:16:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8200) no doubt about that maybe a lie maybe a  
[2:16:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8203) public history about you I saw this guy  
[2:16:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8205) with a woman which is not his wife  
[2:16:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8208) that's that's book done  
[2:16:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8210) doesn't it take you a photo of them but  
[2:16:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8212) if you do something through the prophet  
[2:16:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8214) or Ari then you get also then you become  
[2:16:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8216) a catheter because I have the same  
[2:16:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8218) protection from from insult like the  
[2:17:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8220) prophet because of the Hadith and this  
[2:17:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8222) Hadith also for example he could have  
[2:17:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8225) answered that if he had any break  
[2:17:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8227) she's unable  
[2:17:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8229) and she said I don't understand the  
[2:17:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8230) meaning let's go and ask somebody  
[2:17:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8233) at that time no no no don't don't talk  
[2:17:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8237) about that don't ask about that  
[2:17:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8239) covering up  
[2:17:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8242) I I know it is very hard for many people  
[2:17:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8244) to be shocked to hear that today about  
[2:17:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8246) the scholars and Imam I just don't know  
[2:17:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8248) what Jamal Ahmed hamburger and things  
[2:17:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8251) like that be shocked  
[2:17:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8253) because you have to get out of this  
[2:17:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8255) mindset the alma is now buffed at the  
[2:17:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8257) decline and the complete defeat and  
[2:17:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8259) finishing of the khilafa on the ground  
[2:17:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8260) now now we have to build clean  
[2:17:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8263) look at the foundation the foundation  
[2:17:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8265) which we have received over the  
[2:17:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8267) generation is definitely rotten  
[2:17:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8269) otherwise the building would not have  
[2:17:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8270) collapsed  
[2:17:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8272) so we have to clean that Rod but  
[2:17:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8275) solid iron hard  
[2:17:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8278) Granite hot Foundation I built on it and  
[2:18:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8281) this cannot go on without digging a  
[2:18:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8283) little bit and getting the belt out even  
[2:18:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8285) if it's painful  
[2:18:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8288) even if it's painful there's no  
[2:18:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8290) freelance you have to do it  
[2:18:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8292) as I would be being circular anyway let  
[2:18:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8295) me tell me just summary about the  
[2:18:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8297) current monthly and salafi live in  
[2:18:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8299) alhamdulillah may be obsessed and maybe  
[2:18:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8301) you have some some positive aspects for  
[2:18:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8303) this video was extremely anti-change of  
[2:18:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8306) sharia and things like that no doubt  
[2:18:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8308) about that let's assume that but these  
[2:18:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8310) guys they are only  
[2:18:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8314) in the protection of the job they have  
[2:18:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8316) no other job  
[2:18:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8318) they will be extremely hard to do with  
[2:18:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8320) any small violation or that if I think a  
[2:18:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8322) violation and they will be extremely  
[2:18:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8324) lenient liberal with the with the rulers  
[2:18:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8328) and because they cannot run away from  
[2:18:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8329) issue of cover boy because the agreement  
[2:18:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8331) of all Muslims although they will become  
[2:18:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8332) clever blatantly they try to get their  
[2:18:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8335) Rolexes but if it does everything and  
[2:18:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8338) even the publicly publicly they say for  
[2:19:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8341) example this is recently said even if  
[2:19:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8343) you see him in television publicly  
[2:19:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8346) doing sodomy and fornication  
[2:19:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8349) you still have to obey him  
[2:19:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8354) holikoff  
[2:19:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8356) even when I came in or record not saying  
[2:19:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8358) that if you see conference only you  
[2:19:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8359) cannot Rebellion but he said in a  
[2:19:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8362) question  
[2:19:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8363) ing the algeena regime by the way  
[2:19:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8366) he said  
[2:19:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8368) let's assume  
[2:19:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8370) an assumption Which is far away but this  
[2:19:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8372) assume the following assumption let's  
[2:19:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8374) assume he's cut about the ruler usually  
[2:19:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8377) the discussion was about the question  
[2:19:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8379) was about a general rule as after the  
[2:19:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8381) coup d'etat in the 90s but it applies so  
[2:19:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8384) everyone else  
[2:19:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8386) then  
[2:19:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8390) charge the hearts against him  
[2:19:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8393) meaning you should not tell the people  
[2:19:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8395) he's the recovery you should hate him  
[2:19:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8397) you should reject him Etc not even that  
[2:20:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8400) he asked why  
[2:20:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8402) why  
[2:20:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8404) essentially saying just to let it cover  
[2:20:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8407) and close your eyes leave it don't get  
[2:20:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8409) involved with that  
[2:20:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8412) even the conspiracy undis available now  
[2:20:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8414) the record is available and the videos  
[2:20:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8415) just before we did this I probably made  
[2:20:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8418) a very good point he sent me a message  
[2:20:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8420) said we should start calling them  
[2:20:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8421) secular celebrities  
[2:20:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8424) secular selfies yeah essentially because  
[2:20:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8427) essential because basically there is  
[2:20:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8430) nothing you can do or they can legislate  
[2:20:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8433) or a power they are as deviant from from  
[2:20:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8437) Islam with basic Foundation as Paul is  
[2:20:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8440) deviant from true Christianity Paul was  
[2:20:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8443) also a selfie in that sense and the  
[2:20:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8445) magically in that sense because he told  
[2:20:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8446) the people uh arguing with Qatar now  
[2:20:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8449) they take the Escape Route of Qatar  
[2:20:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8451) arguing he said that you you should obey  
[2:20:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8455) the Emperor who was Pagan at the time he  
[2:20:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8457) doesn't want to have a conversation with  
[2:20:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8458) the government  
[2:20:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8459) because he could not become an emperor  
[2:21:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8462) without Allah permission this obviously  
[2:21:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8464) appearing for qataria  
[2:21:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8466) and he is needed to establish the safety  
[2:21:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8469) of the Roses exactly what I want to say  
[2:21:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8471) um I'm an amount of security and that's  
[2:21:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8473) all what counts and the kingdom of  
[2:21:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8477) Christ is Otherworld in the next life  
[2:21:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8479) not here there's no Kingdom of Christ  
[2:21:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8480) here  
[2:21:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8481) because Christ has has announced the  
[2:21:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8484) kingdom the whole book is about the  
[2:21:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8486) gospel is saying about announcing the  
[2:21:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8489) kingdom the kingdom is near and so on  
[2:21:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8491) and the interpreted kingdom is  
[2:21:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8492) Otherworld reality the kingdom let me  
[2:21:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8494) give you an interpretation and people  
[2:21:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8495) may think about it the other side issue  
[2:21:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8498) as an important issue the kingdom he's  
[2:21:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8500) announced is essentially announcing  
[2:21:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8501) Muhammad or the Sharia will be  
[2:21:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8503) established and we will have will have  
[2:21:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8505) systems  
[2:21:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8506) essentially so the kingdom of God will  
[2:21:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8509) be on earth  
[2:21:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8510) the kingdom of the other word is  
[2:21:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8512) something yes it's not this word  
[2:21:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8514) but anyways of that that's the sport so  
[2:21:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8517) there are probably in Muslims like like  
[2:22:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8520) a deviant and  
[2:22:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8522) Christianity which the only one survived  
[2:22:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8525) since the third century reportage is or  
[2:22:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8528) even second century is is utter  
[2:22:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8530) deviation  
[2:22:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8532) and that is connected with attributing  
[2:22:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8534) divinity to Christ and things like that  
[2:22:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8536) which attacks our people more attention  
[2:22:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8538) but the reality the catastrophe happens  
[2:22:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8539) with this statement  
[2:22:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8541) that the kingdom colleges otherworldly  
[2:22:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8543) that the emperor Rules by by Allah's  
[2:22:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8545) permission even is only the creative  
[2:22:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8547) permission nobody should Rebel you  
[2:22:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8549) should submit should obey and listen  
[2:22:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8551) that's exactly probably in Christianity  
[2:22:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8554) is just like an icing on the cake  
[2:22:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8557) actually  
[2:22:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8558) in that example you gave him Abdullah  
[2:22:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8560) when he uh had that interaction with  
[2:22:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8562) with Saud and he's and just the fact  
[2:22:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8566) that he was prepared to relegate issues  
[2:22:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8569) of a person legislate more oppressing or  
[2:22:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8572) taking tax and just considering it not a  
[2:22:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8574) big deal is another early indicator of  
[2:22:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8576) this kind of hierarchy that they said  
[2:22:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8578) the motivation is he said as long as you  
[2:23:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8582) support me for the for for tahit he was  
[2:23:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8585) so obsessed that he's blinded of that  
[2:23:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8587) that's not the same like  
[2:23:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8588) systematically and theoretically and  
[2:23:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8591) found it as a structured argument in  
[2:23:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8593) books and publications  
[2:23:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8595) they they are acting like the yahoots  
[2:23:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8597) they are clearly when you say the  
[2:23:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8599) evidence is completely blind say oh this  
[2:23:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8602) is the sin and so on okay and another  
[2:23:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8604) another  
[2:23:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8607) in the future you will be the taxes I  
[2:23:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8609) think it's fabricated this Edition but  
[2:23:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8611) maybe that's what he came in his mind  
[2:23:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8612) and the other writer  
[2:23:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8614) gets what is his mind whatever  
[2:23:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8616) justification is just because of the  
[2:23:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8618) blinding of opposition that's different  
[2:23:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8620) than astruction Theory represented for  
[2:23:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8625) example one recent guy of them  
[2:23:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8627) foreign  
[2:24:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8640) that's what the ruling is excluded to  
[2:24:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8642) Allah the fundamental initial definition  
[2:24:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8645) the formulation maybe is given to the  
[2:24:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8648) prophets the application in court  
[2:24:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8650) judicial is left to the judges  
[2:24:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8652) application in executive branch is left  
[2:24:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8655) to the executive branch that's a type of  
[2:24:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8656) ruling a judgment and so on that's just  
[2:24:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8658) to clarify what we said about the  
[2:24:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8660) stupidity about there's the only ruler  
[2:24:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8664) is Allah Only Rule in that sense okay  
[2:24:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8666) this this meaning Allah is Ultimate  
[2:24:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8669) which is a fundamental Muslims one is  
[2:24:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8671) essentially the meaning  
[2:24:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8675) foreign  
[2:24:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8685) to give you a message from him  
[2:24:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8687) do don't do  
[2:24:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8689) know me don't know me  
[2:24:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8691) avoid this to do this  
[2:24:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8694) or just even present him you must know  
[2:24:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8697) that I have these attributes even if he  
[2:24:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8698) doesn't have any injunction just telling  
[2:25:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8700) you about the Divine media Divine wants  
[2:25:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8703) you to believe in that and appreciate it  
[2:25:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8705) at least  
[2:25:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8706) foreign  
[2:25:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8742) do you know what the title of the book  
[2:25:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8743) says  
[2:25:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8749) something extra  
[2:25:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8753) like like if you say the peak of the  
[2:25:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8756) mountain no the the base of my team  
[2:25:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8758) first but ignore the peak the peak does  
[2:26:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8760) not need to considered as if the peak is  
[2:26:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8762) not resting on the base  
[2:26:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8765) is  
[2:26:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8772) coming from Hakimi not from from and we  
[2:26:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8776) have a unique case which is purely  
[2:26:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8778) Hakimi has nothing to do with other  
[2:26:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8779) deity in the classical sense the circle  
[2:26:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8782) of people  
[2:26:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8783) because they dead legislate for  
[2:26:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8785) themselves that that that  
[2:26:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8787) cohabiting with male is permissible  
[2:26:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8789) that's it if you check the Old Testament  
[2:26:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8792) did they have any Idols no Quran does  
[2:26:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8795) not mention any  
[2:26:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8797) story after a lot from the beginning of  
[2:26:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8799) the end of the Quran I was surprised  
[2:26:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8802) when I noticed this thing a few years  
[2:26:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8804) ago so I said maybe I'm mistaken so let  
[2:26:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8807) me say I had it nothing about the Hadith  
[2:26:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8809) story let me check the Old Testament it  
[2:26:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8813) may be part of it to be fabricated but  
[2:26:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8815) at least the core of the story may be  
[2:26:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8816) correct and the whole story of a lot and  
[2:27:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8820) the people of lot  
[2:27:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8821) no Idols nothing absolutely nothing only  
[2:27:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8824) legislating that's what they desire  
[2:27:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8826) undermining hakimia  
[2:27:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8829) and there we speak English and they have  
[2:27:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8831) punished one of the most civil  
[2:27:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8833) punishment in history by volcanic  
[2:27:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8835) eruption Stone from heaven  
[2:27:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8838) so we have this head all other  
[2:27:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8840) prophecies like that mostly it's  
[2:27:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8841) hakeemia  
[2:27:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8843) which people don't recognize  
[2:27:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8846) even if around  
[2:27:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8847) when he ultimately after a long  
[2:27:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8849) discussion tells Musa  
[2:27:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8852) if you adopt another day at himself me I  
[2:27:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8855) will put you in prison I am the deity  
[2:27:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8857) I am the ruler  
[2:27:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8859) I'm the king of Egypt and the son that  
[2:27:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8861) he's the son of the god of the sun god  
[2:27:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8864) that's fine that's something  
[2:27:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8865) metaphysical but the reality of the  
[2:27:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8867) discussion is I am the king here and I  
[2:27:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8870) am the deity Here I Am the ruler here  
[2:27:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8874) that's being founded on being the son of  
[2:27:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8876) the sun god I suggest metaphysical but a  
[2:27:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8879) reality  
[2:28:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8880) my ruling is final not your God  
[2:28:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8885) like most other musician if you analyze  
[2:28:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8887) it carefully is that  
[2:28:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8890) it's going to hackamia  
[2:28:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8892) not to have another day it is also they  
[2:28:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8895) have they have I'm not saying they don't  
[2:28:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8896) have but the real a lot they'll not have  
[2:28:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8898) a lot  
[2:28:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8899) and he's mentioned the same stream like  
[2:28:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8901) other progress the same general  
[2:28:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8903) statement  
[2:28:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8907) and so just at the recommend this guy I  
[2:28:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8909) don't remember his name I think he says  
[2:28:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8910) maybe  
[2:28:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8911) someone called the thrah maybe or  
[2:28:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8914) another guy from there from the this  
[2:28:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8916) cohort  
[2:28:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8917) they  
[2:28:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8919) he said  
[2:28:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8921) it must be established then we discuss  
[2:28:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8923) Hakeem  
[2:28:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8925) why  
[2:28:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8927) Festival is still enforce the opposition  
[2:28:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8929) possibly he has also a televisioned  
[2:28:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8932) meaning prevention Graves and leveling  
[2:28:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8934) them down things like that and then we  
[2:28:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8937) discuss hatimia  
[2:28:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8939) ignoring that Hakimi is the peak at the  
[2:29:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8941) the spinal cord of the heat the brain of  
[2:29:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8944) the Heat  
[2:29:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8950) and that's what the circular discipline  
[2:29:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8952) Distributing circularism  
[2:29:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8955) let's say guys I'm not discussing these  
[2:29:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8957) two deities or something or or something  
[2:29:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8959) with wings flying they're not bothered  
[2:29:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8961) about that they say maybe maybe not one  
[2:29:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8963) God because  
[2:29:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8969) declaring good and evil is for us  
[2:29:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8971) that's it we are the sovereign  
[2:29:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8985) it gets really ridiculous because even  
[2:29:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8987) for example I have no Bayer to Saudi  
[2:29:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8991) Saudi if me my family every single one  
[2:29:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8995) of us were to beg we can't become Saudi  
[2:29:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=8997) citizen yeah if I was to say my MBs is a  
[2:30:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9000)  it's a scumbag  
[2:30:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9003) apparently that's despite the fact he's  
[2:30:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9006) not even my ruler how can I have a Bayer  
[2:30:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9009) saying that if they're saying that  
[2:30:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9011) because they think they're there because  
[2:30:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9013) the only one ruling by Islam and the  
[2:30:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9015) automatic and everyone I don't know what  
[2:30:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9017) how they structure that I have no idea  
[2:30:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9019) how they structure  
[2:30:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9020) but definitely leave that that one in  
[2:30:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9023) Saudi Arabia and have have have  
[2:30:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9024) nationality and so on that's the  
[2:30:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9027) definition of follows is faulty it's  
[2:30:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9029) definitely faulty we have we have  
[2:30:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9031) decided what college is we mentioned the  
[2:30:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9032) story of this mysterious man we have  
[2:30:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9035) mentioned the well I mentioned Hadith  
[2:30:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9037) then we should only one of them actually  
[2:30:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9039) but there are tons of them all of them  
[2:30:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9041) said  
[2:30:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9042) they read the Quran they don't digest it  
[2:30:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9045) they  
[2:30:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9046) they accept the the the uh the community  
[2:30:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9051) or the dean it's your the word Dean is a  
[2:30:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9055) community it can be the Adidas could be  
[2:30:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9056) having several meaning the word Deen is  
[2:30:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9058) not only a religion or a Creed no like  
[2:31:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9061) like an arrow exiting the the bow  
[2:31:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9064) and they kill the Believers and leave  
[2:31:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9067) the pagans that's what the underwater  
[2:31:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9070) said if I reach him if I find them if I  
[2:31:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9073) meet them I will experiment the people  
[2:31:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9074) about  
[2:31:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9075) and he's saying commenting on July  
[2:31:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9078) another story of this message  
[2:31:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9081) will establish nobody arguing about his  
[2:31:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9084) establishment told him Muhammad your  
[2:31:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9086) unjust in distributing some some gold  
[2:31:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9095) prohibited him from killing him and then  
[2:31:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9097) he commented that that's it  
[2:31:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9101) when if if I catch them when they come  
[2:31:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9103) out there's one in front of you now  
[2:31:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9105) that's not coming out even a messenger  
[2:31:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9107) you are unjust  
[2:31:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9109) plain and clear cover is not  
[2:31:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9113) um  
[2:31:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9115) is blabbering nonsense  
[2:31:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9118) if I live until I see them  
[2:32:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9121) then I'll exterminate them it's one of  
[2:32:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9123) them no when they come out with a sword  
[2:32:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9129) so obvious  
[2:32:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9131) I'm so plain but these people are just  
[2:32:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9133) mockery of the same human being  
[2:32:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9136) of Quran  
[2:32:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9140) just to bring it back to the current  
[2:32:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9141) events as well  
[2:32:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9145) several of these statements are  
[2:32:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9147) statement of copper and himself but they  
[2:32:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9149) were not declared them covered because  
[2:32:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9151) that a statement of covert can be  
[2:32:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9153) uttered by someone who is blind  
[2:32:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9155) who is mentally deranged who does not  
[2:32:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9157) connect things properly but if you  
[2:32:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9159) connect verbally and persist that he  
[2:32:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9160) become a cafe in his individual capacity  
[2:32:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9165) but the statements are statement of  
[2:32:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9167) course  
[2:32:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9168) which specific statements or these  
[2:32:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9170) statement they say  
[2:32:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9172) that evening  
[2:33:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9183) so it's effectively if knowingly there  
[2:33:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9187) is Messenger  
[2:33:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9195) told you stated and fighting the  
[2:33:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9197) community is treated  
[2:33:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9202) the the punishment views of wage war I  
[2:33:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9205) guess Allah is messenger that's the one  
[2:33:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9206) who depart the community and fight  
[2:33:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9208) they're the one who will be killed  
[2:33:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9217) the word is very Central for Muslims and  
[2:33:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9220) wakes memories of people are fighting  
[2:33:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9222) Alibaba without him and they're killing  
[2:33:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9224) them they play this game making  
[2:33:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9226) Association  
[2:33:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9230) but this is a classical trick by all  
[2:33:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9232) deviants and by all people who want to  
[2:33:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9234) spread and  
[2:33:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9235) a Mischief like for example when when  
[2:33:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9239) people are discussing for example  
[2:34:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9241) punishment for uh let's say for  
[2:34:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9243) fornication say punishing love Is Just  
[2:34:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9246) rename fornication into love  
[2:34:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9249) foreign  
[2:34:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9279) foreign  
[2:34:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9297) specifically said it's really  
[2:35:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9300) Way Off the Mark he for example this  
[2:35:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9302) brother Riyad did this this  
[2:35:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9305) um video where he's talking about  
[2:35:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9306) somebody who's declaring allegiance to  
[2:35:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9308) King Charles  
[2:35:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9309) and he explained how that's you know  
[2:35:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9313) um Allah Hakim etc etc and then and he  
[2:35:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9317) made the false correlation with that and  
[2:35:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9320) uh this this person makes me quieter  
[2:35:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9323) just for having that mentality and then  
[2:35:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9324) his brother for example by extension  
[2:35:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9326) says but they've never advocated this  
[2:35:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9330) this one this one I think this one  
[2:35:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9331) there's nothing inside there inside the  
[2:35:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9333) flame of Islam because you cannot you  
[2:35:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9336) couldn't say anything  
[2:35:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9339) what can I say I have a cognitive  
[2:35:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9341) security with King Charles I'm living in  
[2:35:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9343) the domain oh that guy I don't attack  
[2:35:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9345) him I don't kill his population he  
[2:35:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9348) doesn't attack me he doesn't take my  
[2:35:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9350) money and we're already but I'm not  
[2:35:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9352) alleged to him in the sense that if he  
[2:35:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9354) calls me to join the Army and fight with  
[2:35:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9356) that I'm obliged to do that  
[2:35:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9359) I don't I cannot have Allegiance I have  
[2:36:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9362) only a limited governance of security  
[2:36:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9363) there's that you could call that some  
[2:36:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9365) part of our regions but because of you  
[2:36:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9367) you need it for yourself protection  
[2:36:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9369) according to the island but  
[2:36:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9372) you must technically call it Allegiance  
[2:36:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9375) because you behave as if you are the  
[2:36:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9377) citizen who have allegiance to a genuine  
[2:36:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9379) citizen who have allegiance to the king  
[2:36:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9380) for example  
[2:36:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9382) but only that says  
[2:36:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9384) the the word Allegiance  
[2:36:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9386) only that sense if it means more than  
[2:36:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9388) that like analysis to a Muslim ruler  
[2:36:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9392) or fighting him  
[2:36:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9394) whatever foreign  
[2:36:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9414) definitions you have to stick to them  
[2:36:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9416) you cannot mix the Sharia upside down  
[2:36:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9419) you think you'll get away  
[2:37:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9434) and fought against him and drained some  
[2:37:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9436) of his resources he would have finished  
[2:37:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9438) the the munafar cafe  
[2:37:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9441) that's what in people's minds generally  
[2:37:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9445) so it brings Association which is  
[2:37:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9446) extremely negative foreign  
[2:37:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9460) because they have the protection they  
[2:37:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9462) don't kill me I don't kill them they  
[2:37:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9463) don't attack me they start to attack  
[2:37:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9465) them  
[2:37:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9467) just to clarify this video so this video  
[2:37:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9469) originally this brother was commenting  
[2:37:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9470) on a person who's an MP and he's making  
[2:37:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9473) the oath of Allegiance and then the  
[2:37:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9475) contention was about his use of the word  
[2:37:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9477) of translations  
[2:38:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9480) we have nothing to hide we have a  
[2:38:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9482) structural point of view with this  
[2:38:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9484) arguments  
[2:38:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9489) what you have here as a Muslim even if  
[2:38:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9493) you're born in Britain you don't have  
[2:38:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9495) you're not allowed as a Muslim to have  
[2:38:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9496) full Allegiance you have only a limited  
[2:38:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9498) one which is called the Covenant of  
[2:38:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9499) security  
[2:38:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9503) if you do them  
[2:38:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9505) you are breaking the Covenant of  
[2:38:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9507) security  
[2:38:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9509) that's not true  
[2:38:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9513) exiting from the ummah  
[2:38:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9516) I'm going back fighting it with the  
[2:38:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9518) sword that's exiting from not even even  
[2:38:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9522) not even fighting the ruler we have the  
[2:38:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9524) Hadith for example I'm saying Allah said  
[2:38:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9529) Allah said  
[2:39:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9541) and then he said except for three what I  
[2:39:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9544) said I knew that he must receive  
[2:39:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9545) Revelation remind him you have to  
[2:39:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9547) mention something  
[2:39:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9549) clarify  
[2:39:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9551) as accept naxos  
[2:39:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9558) foreign  
[2:39:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9564) foreign  
[2:39:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9588) and then you turn back and fight him  
[2:39:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9590) with your sword so even fighting with  
[2:39:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9591) the sword is not so God  
[2:39:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9592) okay  
[2:39:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9594) and then  
[2:39:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9596) that you exit the community and fight  
[2:39:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9599) the Muslim with your soul so even let's  
[2:40:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9600) talk Christiana  
[2:40:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9604) but not Nexus  
[2:40:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9606) so tell the people stop it your game is  
[2:40:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9609) over  
[2:40:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9610) it's exposed the Hadith are here and you  
[2:40:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9613) are working with them and will build all  
[2:40:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9614) their channels and all weddings and  
[2:40:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9616) exposing who played games with a Hadith  
[2:40:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9618) from the classical Scholars following  
[2:40:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9621) his either mischievously or stupidly or  
[2:40:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9623) being blinded by the ideology like Ahmed  
[2:40:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9628) militant having injunction about how to  
[2:40:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9631) confront bad rulers and so on they have  
[2:40:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9634) usually tell what to do when to fight  
[2:40:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9636) them or not that tale is usually cut and  
[2:40:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9638) then you find this in bukhari you find  
[2:40:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9640) the theory you find the theory find it  
[2:40:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9641) here but in the Muslims we'll exploit  
[2:40:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9644) that also  
[2:40:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9646) they remind me of the yehud you know  
[2:40:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9648) when they cover that exactly so they do  
[2:40:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9651) the following they will not work first  
[2:40:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9652) of all they write the book of uh books  
[2:40:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9655) with or writing and climates from Allah  
[2:40:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9658) so they they make definition and they  
[2:41:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9660) make a writing essentially and claim  
[2:41:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9662) that's exactly what what it is saying  
[2:41:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9666) we're just translating it is just in an  
[2:41:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9668) easy language for the people  
[2:41:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9670) essentially saying this is from Allah  
[2:41:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9672) essentially  
[2:41:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9680) in the appendix of it or the later part  
[2:41:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9683) of it it claims that after the Exile and  
[2:41:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9685) after the punishment Allah will make a  
[2:41:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9687) covenant would stay forever for Israel  
[2:41:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9688) everyone will be having we know this is  
[2:41:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9690) a fabrication  
[2:41:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9692) Covenant was not renewed and they never  
[2:41:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9694) stayed happy and the Roman came and  
[2:41:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9696) kicked their butt we know that so it's a  
[2:41:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9698) fabrication  
[2:41:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9701) so this is genuinely attributed to  
[2:41:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9703) Jeremiah  
[2:41:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9704) to that level is not possible in Islam  
[2:41:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9706) because Quran is protected and soon  
[2:41:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9708) enter that is protected but still some  
[2:41:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9710) of the fabricata had it  
[2:41:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9713) one of the publication we usually shami  
[2:41:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9715) follower of and so on an Antarctic  
[2:41:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9718) Hadith reported the decides for one day  
[2:41:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9719) shall we analyze it and present it to  
[2:42:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9721) everyone he says  
[2:42:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9728) audacity with the one who fabricated  
[2:42:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9730) this Hadith because  
[2:42:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9732) you meet Allah  
[2:42:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9735) you meet Allah and you see  
[2:42:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9738) our Lord  
[2:42:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9739) no injustices  
[2:42:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9742) told us that we should obey  
[2:42:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9746) we have the benefit and the reward for  
[2:42:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9748) obedience and the ruler will have the  
[2:42:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9750) punishment for their misdeed you say  
[2:42:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9752) they are right I'm going to do that  
[2:42:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9755) that's a blatant cover the fabrication  
[2:42:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9759) so we have that also because if you say  
[2:42:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9761) it Hadith is from Allah  
[2:42:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9766) did not list that David and they don't  
[2:42:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9768) know everything that had it out trust me  
[2:42:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9770) we're still better than some of the  
[2:42:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9772) scholars in time but you might yeah  
[2:42:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9776) secondly  
[2:42:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9778) taking things out of context  
[2:43:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9781) if you take things out of cutest then  
[2:43:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9783) you twist the word from its meaning  
[2:43:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9785) because in the context shows demeanic  
[2:43:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9787) if you take them out  
[2:43:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9790) or cut part of the context then you have  
[2:43:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9793) Twisted the meaning  
[2:43:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9804) both even in simple verbs and sentences  
[2:43:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9806) and in structured information by taking  
[2:43:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9809) something also contest and change the  
[2:43:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9811) wording  
[2:43:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9812) give me things that that's the declaring  
[2:43:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9814) these things which are not maybe they  
[2:43:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9816) are serious I'm not saying they're not  
[2:43:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9818) serious but they're not it's not the  
[2:43:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9820) word which is not for that  
[2:43:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9823) foreign  
[2:43:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9834) will become will become a salad  
[2:43:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9839) and then cover will enter  
[2:44:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9840) particular welcome donkeys will come  
[2:44:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9843) pigs will come everyone enter it will  
[2:44:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9845) come an urban Garden everyone can graze  
[2:44:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9847) there  
[2:44:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9848) Nicki Minaj will come which is happening  
[2:44:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9850) now Halloween exactly  
[2:44:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9852) exactly so  
[2:44:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9854) so that's that's they have this we have  
[2:44:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9856) these all these characters  
[2:44:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9858) from that  
[2:44:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9860) he won't you never films that Hadith you  
[2:44:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9862) will follow the the methods of the  
[2:44:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9864) previous people even if they go in the  
[2:44:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9866) lizard hall and then another narration  
[2:44:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9868) is nice reminisce by the way  
[2:44:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9872) another one even if one of them have  
[2:44:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9874) ornicated his mother publicly you  
[2:44:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9877) someone of you will be doing that so  
[2:44:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9879) mention  
[2:44:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9880) the extent but he mentioned  
[2:44:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9883) is Visual and extreme so that everyone  
[2:44:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9885) understand even the symbols between they  
[2:44:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9887) would not have said if they would have  
[2:44:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9889) changed the Quran or changed words and  
[2:44:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9891) so on That's So too sophisticated but  
[2:44:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9893) there's example is clear if someone even  
[2:44:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9896) committed Zina with his mother publicly  
[2:44:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9899) someone of you will do the same you will  
[2:45:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9900) follow them  
[2:45:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9902) say yes in another narration he  
[2:45:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9905) mentioned president and the Romans most  
[2:45:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9907) like in matter of statecraft are running  
[2:45:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9909) the state  
[2:45:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9911) just to tell the future no to warn  
[2:45:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9915) blade don't follow their ways  
[2:45:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9918) keep distance keep  
[2:45:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9921) watching cautiously and ridiculously  
[2:45:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9924) don't fall in these traps  
[2:45:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9926) but the people decided to not listen  
[2:45:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9930) unfortunately because this is a domain  
[2:45:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9933) of testing  
[2:45:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9935) but does not justify that even instant  
[2:45:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9939) we ought not have done that and you will  
[2:45:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9941) be asked for that and you'll be  
[2:45:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9942) accounted for that  
[2:45:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9946) so it's really almost like the Jews and  
[2:45:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9948) also in other aspect like faculty  
[2:45:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9951) going extreme and piety abstaining upon  
[2:45:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9954) things which is just fearful and so on  
[2:45:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9958) creating things without evidence and so  
[2:46:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9960) on calling it being prior to you  
[2:46:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9964) avoid this this is suspicious this is  
[2:46:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9966) suspicion yes if you don't know about  
[2:46:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9967) something that's suspicious  
[2:46:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9969) but you have no certitude yes but in  
[2:46:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9972) itself there's nothing an unknown  
[2:46:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9978) maybe for an individual like the Hadith  
[2:46:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9980) famous Hadith  
[2:46:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9981) and this is between things which may be  
[2:46:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9984) confusing for certain people if it's  
[2:46:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9986) conclusion for you then avoid it but  
[2:46:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9990) for Scholars should not be should be  
[2:46:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9992) able to sort the confusion and then  
[2:46:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9994) guide the general public about the  
[2:46:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9995) confusion not the opposite I'd add  
[2:46:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=9997) confusion to them to misguide them and  
[2:46:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10000) to benefit their oldest  
[2:46:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10002) my my statement is the most leader of  
[2:46:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10004) the Madrid are most likely monastic out  
[2:46:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10008) of the world of Islam unfortunately I  
[2:46:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10010) have to say that the followers are blind  
[2:46:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10012) idiots  
[2:46:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10014) the Sebastian can say about them  
[2:46:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10016) otherwise they will be covered  
[2:46:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10017) no it's better to be an idiot I don't  
[2:46:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10019) care that to be a couple in my  
[2:47:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10021) perception at least I don't know what  
[2:47:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10023) you'll taste in that but everywhere  
[2:47:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10025) thousand to be a donkey and to be  
[2:47:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10026) approved  
[2:47:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10029) a supposedly a stupid innocent animal  
[2:47:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10034) s  
[2:47:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10036) having read um gone to two-thirds of it  
[2:47:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10039) it destroys all of this honestly it's in  
[2:47:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10043) Arabic and Sergeant Libman  
[2:47:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10045) yeah  
[2:47:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10049) just a footnote and clarification  
[2:47:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10053) because I must have Hadith in that area  
[2:47:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10055) most not all are ahead  
[2:47:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10057) and I wouldn't go and say something  
[2:47:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10059) fundamental just when I had although  
[2:47:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10062) some of them are really the level of  
[2:47:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10063) motivated  
[2:47:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10067) and the reasoning is profound I saw the  
[2:47:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10069) all the all the all the discussions  
[2:47:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10073) please uh you and the other shabab  
[2:47:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10075) should uh accelerate and can completing  
[2:47:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10077) the review of that translation  
[2:48:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10080) and hopefully this will be because I  
[2:48:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10082) think the English reading public is is  
[2:48:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10084) more more sophisticated and more willing  
[2:48:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10086) to read than the Arabic public  
[2:48:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10087) unfortunately we have our book of  
[2:48:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10089) hakimiya in the market now  
[2:48:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10092) I would have an edited version coming a  
[2:48:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10094) more polished one inshallah but the one  
[2:48:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10095) is for 20 years  
[2:48:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10097) it doesn't seem to have anybody bothered  
[2:48:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10099) about really reading it or rebutting it  
[2:48:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10101) or or advising us about errors in it and  
[2:48:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10105) so on nobody unfortunately which is very  
[2:48:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10107) unfortunate so the at least the Arabic  
[2:48:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10110) section of the ummah is is  
[2:48:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10112) seemed to be in general in deep in deep  
[2:48:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10114) sleep snorling  
[2:48:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10118) they are like that mysterious man who  
[2:48:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10120) just say Sal hello and then proceed he  
[2:48:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10123) doesn't need to sit in a halaka he  
[2:48:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10124) doesn't need to make a book of massage  
[2:48:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10125) we have everything we have we have we  
[2:48:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10129) have us as the the people of Makkah say  
[2:48:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10131) we got the the wolf from its there why  
[2:48:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10133) we should model about something else and  
[2:48:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10136) this is the way of the downhill  
[2:48:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10139) the studies in many times I hear someone  
[2:49:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10141) wrote a book or something new in that  
[2:49:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10143) area I try to upload it and see it maybe  
[2:49:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10145) I did a new angle maybe he detected some  
[2:49:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10148) mistake in our link or something which  
[2:49:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10150) we will have overlooked and we have  
[2:49:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10152) corrected many things you see some of  
[2:49:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10153) our recent writing correct many other  
[2:49:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10155) all the mistakes which we were doing for  
[2:49:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10157) 25 30 years thrusting some old driving  
[2:49:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10160) but then fine there's evidence  
[2:49:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10162) compelling evidence that it was wrong  
[2:49:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10164) and we corrected it  
[2:49:26](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10166) safely  
[2:49:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10170) most most significant one is that you  
[2:49:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10172) just mentioned that and then we will  
[2:49:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10173) conclude because I think we took a very  
[2:49:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10175) long time  
[2:49:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10176) most significant is the issue with when  
[2:49:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10178) where we're going today but the dash die  
[2:49:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10181) the Islamic State of your life before it  
[2:49:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10183) became Islamic State of Arkansas so it  
[2:49:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10184) was that he before it became daesh  
[2:49:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10187) that they can established state by  
[2:49:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10189) forceful and Foster People and buy and  
[2:49:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10191) all these things which is obviously  
[2:49:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10192) about it the principle of Surah the  
[2:49:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10194) principle of the authority of the ummah  
[2:49:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10198) they claim that we established the state  
[2:50:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10201) that the domain is empty so since we  
[2:50:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10203) established it we are the one who  
[2:50:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10204) created it we have to enforce it we  
[2:50:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10207) should have an Islamic State that's the  
[2:50:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10208) claim sounds very logical but that's not  
[2:50:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10211) the way I thought at the time that the  
[2:50:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10213) messenger established Islamic State and  
[2:50:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10215) the usual argument is  
[2:50:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10220) to show that he insisted that whoever  
[2:50:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10223) give him nusra  
[2:50:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10225) is is and people who have sufficient  
[2:50:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10228) Authority and self-protection like he  
[2:50:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10230) rejected those novels  
[2:50:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10232) because  
[2:50:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10235) although he has a high mountain and  
[2:50:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10237) massive fortification but his own people  
[2:50:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10240) do not seem to be giving support so if  
[2:50:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10242) you don't have support you don't have no  
[2:50:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10244) Surah your own people must must accept  
[2:50:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10247) that must be standing behind you and  
[2:50:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10248) behind me otherwise it's not so you  
[2:50:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10250) cannot enforce yourself from the people  
[2:50:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10252) and then during that study I noticed  
[2:50:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10256) that our perception is the stage as  
[2:50:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10259) healthy said of establishing state is  
[2:51:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10261) actually mistaken he was looking for  
[2:51:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10264) Nostra he was not looking for for  
[2:51:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10265) leadership and the Bay Area  
[2:51:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10268) the famous buyer which contained that  
[2:51:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10270) freso cover boy  
[2:51:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10273) actually enshrines that he is not a head  
[2:51:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10275) of state  
[2:51:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10276) and this is  
[2:51:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10278) established later as we have shown  
[2:51:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10281) inside Mr Medina  
[2:51:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10282) so he recognized this and they said  
[2:51:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10285) we were mistaken as that he was mistaken  
[2:51:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10288) the his thought was wrong we have to  
[2:51:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10289) collect it evidence is here  
[2:51:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10293) that's the reason if anyone writing  
[2:51:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10294) something in these areas  
[2:51:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10296) I tried to get the book  
[2:51:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10300) I'm trying to go through it as quickly  
[2:51:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10302) as possible maybe there's something new  
[2:51:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10304) maybe there's a new twist maybe there's  
[2:51:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10306) some deepening of a point  
[2:51:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10308) but these people are deciding no no no  
[2:51:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10310) no this is what they're there don't  
[2:51:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10312) treat them  
[2:51:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10313) they will never achieve anything okay  
[2:51:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10315) show us your reading of the Quran that  
[2:51:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10317) you have any depth  
[2:51:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10319) is completely  
[2:52:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10323) zero zilch nothing  
[2:52:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10328) I think we should conclude that but talk  
[2:52:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10330) about my manifestation is that  
[2:52:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10333) multiple people now according with the  
[2:52:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10335) party of the government or the  
[2:52:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10337) government party  
[2:52:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10344) and so on and these are people we know  
[2:52:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10347) there's intelligent Service agents these  
[2:52:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10349) are they are Traders and most likely I'm  
[2:52:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10351) sorry to say that but my personal I hate  
[2:52:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10353) use that term but for Ruby and this help  
[2:52:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10356) I doubt that they are in the fall of  
[2:52:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10358) Islam I think they are monarchy  
[2:52:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10360) the follower as I said again I still  
[2:52:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10363) think they are just blind  
[2:52:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10365) brainwashed idiots luckily so they are  
[2:52:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10368) not  
[2:52:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10369) but they're they're what they adopted  
[2:52:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10371) they think it's a statement of and they  
[2:52:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10373) should depart from that they should  
[2:52:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10375) study it and get rid of it  
[2:52:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10377) does not accelerate them that they are  
[2:52:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10379) stupid and because they're still having  
[2:53:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10381) enough human brain unless they don't  
[2:53:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10383) have a brain and they should they belong  
[2:53:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10385) with the mental institution not in the  
[2:53:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10387) YouTube I'm discussing with other people  
[2:53:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10389) if you are able to discuss with other  
[2:53:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10391) people you should be able to contribute  
[2:53:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10392) these things and go a little bit more  
[2:53:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10394) thoroughly than this rubbish  
[2:53:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10398) briefly so this was considered to be an  
[2:53:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10401) opening Salvo to people of uh Saudi ilk  
[2:53:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10405) and to assist people like brother rohaji  
[2:53:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10408) uh Mohammed hijab to basically destroy  
[2:53:32](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10412) this narrative and and give them a  
[2:53:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10415) better angle we said some of them are  
[2:53:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10416) still having some stains from the  
[2:53:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10419) wahhabi and madhali without they  
[2:53:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10421) noticing I made a commentary said yes  
[2:53:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10423) let me conclude that because they say we  
[2:53:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10424) conclude that just the final and we even  
[2:53:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10426) stop I I noticed uh that even they  
[2:53:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10430) translate there's no deity but Allah  
[2:53:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10432) there's no deity worth of Russia but  
[2:53:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10435) Allah and they made a comment in a video  
[2:53:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10436) of brother Muhammad hijab says stop this  
[2:53:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10439) translation because this transition go  
[2:54:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10441) to the falsehood that worship is  
[2:54:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10444) independently defined from deity no  
[2:54:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10447) worship is in his essential meaning as  
[2:54:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10449) we argue in the book to read even with  
[2:54:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10451) with Precision of mathematical equations  
[2:54:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10453) in chapter 7 I think we have the  
[2:54:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10455) discussed another informal mathematical  
[2:54:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10456) equations  
[2:54:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10458) to that level of sophistication  
[2:54:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10461) with the exact level of of work  
[2:54:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10464) is that worship meaning attributing  
[2:54:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10467) Divinity to something  
[2:54:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10468) its attribution of wind is worship it's  
[2:54:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10470) not standing or were lighting candles or  
[2:54:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10473) charity or Salah and so on you could  
[2:54:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10476) glean that if there's someone a little  
[2:54:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10477) bit of brain and go deeper and the  
[2:54:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10479) statement Allah said about the long  
[2:54:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10481) discussion which is depicted in the Old  
[2:54:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10483) Testament between Allah and Musa it's  
[2:54:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10485) summarizing the Quran very precisely  
[2:54:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10487) because there's no need for that long  
[2:54:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10489) discussion at that time it was needed  
[2:54:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10491) because even a Divine known was not  
[2:54:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10493) established yet and he mentioned what  
[2:54:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10495) the name used by Ibrahim and so on  
[2:54:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10497) that's all go and see it and then I  
[2:54:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10499) summarized that actually in the book of  
[2:55:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10501) David in the Quran summary  
[2:55:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10507) I am Allah now we have a Divine name so  
[2:55:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10510) no need to go about why h w what it  
[2:55:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10513) means Jehovah I am the one who is Ever  
[2:55:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10515) or things like that is all that Allah  
[2:55:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10517) going to contain all of that there's no  
[2:55:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10519) deity beside me  
[2:55:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10521) so what is worship  
[2:55:29](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10529) but we will usually as a player as  
[2:55:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10531) worship no  
[2:55:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10533) is All To Worship  
[2:55:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10535) meaning attribute all Divinity to me  
[2:55:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10537) there is no other deity just they  
[2:55:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10539) enforcing the word  
[2:55:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10541) this is a statement of fact  
[2:55:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10543) how it's reflects on your side does it  
[2:55:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10546) affect independent over here even if  
[2:55:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10548) Musa doesn't exist the holy resident  
[2:55:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10550) said there is no idea to beside Allah  
[2:55:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10552) but there is Hermosa  
[2:55:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10554) finite being with brain with  
[2:55:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10556) capabilities with understanding how  
[2:55:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10559) should he his his response to this fact  
[2:56:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10562) that there's only one deity is  
[2:56:04](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10564) acknowledging it and attributing the  
[2:56:06](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10566) deity only to Allah and rejecting  
[2:56:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10568) attribute to anybody else that's worship  
[2:56:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10580) The Human Side  
[2:56:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10582) worship only Allah it's the same thing  
[2:56:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10584) but seeing from the you see what I mean  
[2:56:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10587) from two sides  
[2:56:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10591) the side of the fact itself and how to  
[2:56:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10594) responds and deal with the fact  
[2:56:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10596) that's it Salah is certain acts in the  
[2:56:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10599) case of Musa is not like our accent  
[2:56:41](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10601) maybe we're like ours may be different  
[2:56:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10602) that's not a lot of the Jews maybe the  
[2:56:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10604) one we should have adopted Mouse I don't  
[2:56:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10606) know is standing in front of of  
[2:56:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10609) something and doing the famous movements  
[2:56:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10612) certain movies was the purpose of it is  
[2:56:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10615) it worship no  
[2:56:57](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10617) it is just to internalize and and  
[2:57:00](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10620) remember Allah because our mind cannot  
[2:57:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10623) be present by having Allah continuous  
[2:57:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10625) Impressions so you have to have certain  
[2:57:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10627) time in the day three times five times  
[2:57:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10629) no should  
[2:57:10](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10630) connect with him  
[2:57:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10632) to get the spiritual healing a spiritual  
[2:57:14](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10634) boost that's it so it's an enactment of  
[2:57:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10637) the command of the day Divine is  
[2:57:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10638) enactment that the the worship aspect of  
[2:57:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10641) the Salah is that you you do the Salah  
[2:57:23](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10643) the way you are ordered to do  
[2:57:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10645) Pleasant example  
[2:57:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10648) when Adam was created  
[2:57:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10651) He was ordered go in the world permitted  
[2:57:33](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10653) to do whatever he wants in the parade is  
[2:57:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10655) everything but do everything go naked no  
[2:57:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10657) no nothing like that only one command  
[2:57:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10660) don't touch this three  
[2:57:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10662) was he not Toshiba did not fulfill the  
[2:57:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10664) Pacific he didn't finish it  
[2:57:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10671) that's all that he and this is enough  
[2:57:53](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10673) that's a complete thing at the time  
[2:57:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10675) even  
[2:58:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10683) nothing at all except this one and still  
[2:58:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10685) he's a complete worshiper  
[2:58:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10687) and even a strongest point of view that  
[2:58:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10689) he was even a prophet  
[2:58:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10695) but he viewed that there's no date  
[2:58:16](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10696) except Allah he knew it and the  
[2:58:19](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10699) attributed all divisions to Allah  
[2:58:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10701) even in a simple way  
[2:58:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10702) like a great spirit of like the we see  
[2:58:25](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10705) by the Native Americans the great spirit  
[2:58:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10707) or by the native the native uh the  
[2:58:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10711) natives of Australia or the some Western  
[2:58:34](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10714) People claimed they don't have the  
[2:58:36](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10716) concept of God because the rest of you  
[2:58:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10718) are stupid they know they themselves  
[2:58:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10720) they have they have but they connect  
[2:58:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10723) with them through dreams and the  
[2:58:44](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10724) previous generations through mental  
[2:58:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10726) media experience but there's some some  
[2:58:48](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10728) overwhelming Universal spirit  
[2:58:50](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10730) and there's no other one that's it  
[2:58:52](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10732) that's all the way and they attribute  
[2:58:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10734) that to him that's the worship October  
[2:58:55](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10735) so he's perfectly washable  
[2:58:59](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10739) and has no other acts to do except that  
[2:59:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10742) one  
[2:59:02](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10742) that's all that ini has at this time  
[2:59:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10745) okay I think we overloaded that is none  
[2:59:08](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10748) and then we'll come back shall see what  
[2:59:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10749) people will come with and I hope we'll  
[2:59:12](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10752) see what will be the reaction which  
[2:59:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10753) questions will come and we address them  
[2:59:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10757) and that was supposedly you will have  
[2:59:18](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10758) done based on the question if we get  
[2:59:20](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10760) them early enough with what then I can't  
[2:59:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10762) give him Hadith about how to deal with  
[2:59:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10764) the rulers and so on like in the Arabic  
[2:59:27](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10767) version of black Arctic the rulers we  
[2:59:28](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10768) don't have it in English yet I think  
[2:59:30](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10770) said we did not start a translation  
[2:59:31](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10771) unfortunately I can summarize some of  
[2:59:35](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10775) them and give you how many it's not are  
[2:59:37](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10777) there just this number I will not read  
[2:59:39](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10779) that because this will be volume this  
[2:59:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10780) will feel easily a a reasonable size  
[2:59:43](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10783) volume I'll just give you that as a  
[2:59:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10785) complete is it is there is your draft  
[2:59:47](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10787) complete now  
[2:59:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10789) my husband will come  
[2:59:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10791) the old version is excellent but I'm  
[2:59:54](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10794) improving it and updating it  
[2:59:56](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10796) yeah there's no there's no translations  
[2:59:58](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10798) for that at the moment I said to the  
[3:00:01](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10801) translate to hold back because I think  
[3:00:03](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10803) we can do more substantial rearrangement  
[3:00:05](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10805) and Improvement and better study  
[3:00:07](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10807) obviousness  
[3:00:09](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10809) because that's why you know 20 years ago  
[3:00:11](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10811) she was very good by the way it's  
[3:00:13](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10813) relatively simple-minded it takes many a  
[3:00:15](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10815) Hadith at face value without discussing  
[3:00:17](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10817) their wedding more thoroughly was enough  
[3:00:21](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10821) but we discussed more slowly Things  
[3:00:22](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10822) become much sharper and would be more  
[3:00:24](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10824) damaging and destroying foreign  
[3:00:38](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10838) it undermined the meaning of Islam  
[3:00:40](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10840) you have it here folks  
[3:00:42](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10842) open discussions can be facilitated yeah  
[3:00:45](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10845) don't sit on this  
[3:00:46](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10846) Anytime Anyplace anywhere  
[3:00:49](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10849) it's on the ball's in your court  
[3:00:51](https://youtu.be/cRawmTCJeh0?t=10851) we will respond meaning
