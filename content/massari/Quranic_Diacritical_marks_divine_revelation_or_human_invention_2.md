It also points out that Hebrew letters do not have any dots, and that this is why the Qur'an does not use the same diacritical marks as Hebrew.  concludes by discussing the possible meaning of the first food in the Qur'an, and whether or not it has any significance.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=300)* Discusses the history of diacritical marks in the Arabic language, and how they were likely invented by scribes trying to ensure the correct pronunciation of the Quran. According to the video, the use of diacritical marks began in the second or first century after Christ, and was almost perfected by the time Islam came into existence. However, even though the use of diacritical marks is permissible, some Muslims choose to eschew them in order to emphasize their Islamic identity.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=600)** The transcript excerpt discusses the development of the Arabic script, and how it came to be written with intrinsic dots (or harakat). Later on, the transcript discusses how the use of harakat may have led to the use of dots instead of harakat, which in turn led to the development of the modern Arabic script.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=900)* Discusses the different readings of the Qur'an, which can be based on linguistic variations or additional narrations. The standard reading, which punishes the punishment of no one, is the most accurate reading.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=1200)** discusses how Quranic diacritical marks (masks) can be divinely intended or human invention.  cites a classical scholar who concludes that a reading must be fitting with the rothmana script, even if it is only a possibility. If it is not reported, it is called a singular reading and is not the quran. Another historic case is of a man who read surah Yusuf using swords, despite the brothers' protests. He argued that he did not "discovered" the diacritical marks, but rather derived them from the quran itself.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=1500)** discusses the different ways in which the Quran can be read, and how some may go overboard with their readings. He believes that it is important to be careful with how one reads the Quran, as it can get excessive. He also points out that there are different ways in which the Quran can be read, and that each person may have their own preference.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=1800)** discusses the variations of Quranic reading, with the presenter stating that whatever has come from variation or we can construct which fits all three principles it has to it has to fit the writing, even with it with a probability.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VUEi_us-c&t=2100) Discusses the possible origins of diacritical marks found in the Quran. They discuss the possibility that some of these marks were intended by God, while others may have been added by human beings. also discusses the possibility that some of these marks may have been used to deceive people.

[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=25) all in a place where it shows you here  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=26) you may doubt if so if that caligra is  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=28) not good they're writing you may say  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=29) it's malu whatever after that  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=31) it comes you are just a human like us  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=35) doesn't make any sense malu will incline  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=37) no no they said kalu it must be kalu you  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=40) see what i mean but if you do it in one  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=42) by one  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=44) is unstable so those who doubted or  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=47) regarded as a doubtful point i would say  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=49) look at it from both angles  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=52) or all angles you will see it is more  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=54) supportive for the divine origin or  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=56) maybe a corroborated much more than from  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=58) the other side for the other side from  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=60) muhammad or from the subconscious or  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=62) from the devil does not make any sense  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=66) does not make any any any sense because  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=68) of these entities they're not capable of  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=71) having all of these capabilities by  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=72) necessity by definition otherwise unless  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=75) we unless we can ask by the way this is  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=77) a theory that is a is a degradation by  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=79) the devil is widespread in some  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=81) christian scholar and is very famously  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=83) attributed in recent times to the  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=85) grandfather of the bush  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=87) i said if but if the devil is capable of  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=90) such such a thing that he has divine  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=92) powers then we are back to the uh to the  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=95) marconi or marshawn and heresy that that  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=99) god has has to appease the devil by  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=101) sacrifices on sun is an equal power to  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=103) god well we are out of monetism into  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=105) dualism and then we have to refute that  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=107) obviously on absolutely national russian  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=109) grounds so it it leads to its  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=111) contradiction and never-ending problems  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=114) you so you try to solve the problem  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=115) muhammad  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=116) for the grandfather of bush by going and  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=119) making a problem for the whole  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=121) reality and existence but by making a  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=124) devil which is equal in power to allah  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=128) manifestly observed  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=129) which has been obviously designed by  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=131) christians since every time she consists  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=133) rationally impossible cannot be  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=134) conceived  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=136) and that's the reason they gave up the  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=138) theory for that and  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=139) they claimed that because of divine  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=141) justice they said there's a necessity to  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=143) shed blood to forgive the uh  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=145) and to overcome adaptation  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=147) not not because to obviously penetrate  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=149) the devil and each other all this is all  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=151) these inner views have been abolished  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=153) and gone because they are impossible  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=154) they are actually very contradictory  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=157) so i'm not arguing now for the divine  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=160) origin for not even  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=162) giving one hypothesis and the result and  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=163) they said feedback of the hypothesis to  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=165) the result and see if it works  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=168) in a coherent way so that is  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=170) the dotting of the letters  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=173) now  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=174) what what makes sense about these  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=176) various narratives say the first word  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=179) etc  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=183) and it seems to be from the context  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=186) it seems to be they mean tashkir  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=191) the reason for that most likely and  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=193) there's even a narration but i have to  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=195) verify it i did not study that issue at  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=197) that point specifically in much more  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=199) detail  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=203) but people who are concerned with these  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=205) studies should go back to it some  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=207) there's even some narration if i'm not  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=209) mistaken if i'm political i know don't  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=211) take me on that and that even obeying  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=213) the cow started doting the poor eye  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=216) what is the origin of that nothing  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=219) so again  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=221) there's no doubt  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=224) so we excluded the dots of the of the  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=226) letters we know what is that  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=229) so what's the meaning of the first food  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=230) in the quran  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=231) and possibly away in the club  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=235) i think people have overlooked  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=238) the following facts first of all  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=241) hebrew the letters do not have any dots  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=243) for their own they say so  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=245) so but they don't have tashki because  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=247) they don't have the small the short  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=249) vowels they have the long words like  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=250) arabic alif wow yeah the long ones  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=254) so you have mal but you have don't have  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=256) mal so if what you write in english m a  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=259) a l or a with a with a cross on top of  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=262) it in the case of phonetic writing  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=264) along a  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=265) the short a is not it's  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=278) we don't know what's it  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=282) and hebrew was protected over the  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=284) tradition already over centuries and  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=286) millennia  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=288) hopefully quite well and there's no  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=290) reason to doubt that has been protected  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=291) reasonably way over history but then  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=295) after the catastrophe over there being  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=297) expelled from palestine after the  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=299) rebellion of the balka and the time of  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=301) hadrian specifically but before that  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=303) especially in that one  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=307) they felt the need  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=309) even the catastrophe really in time of  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=311) the mukha nasa was not that because many  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=313) people remained in palestine and the one  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=315) went to and then uh taken by the boko  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=317) haram  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=318) sufficiently in number that they could  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=320) even keep the language and keep the  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=322) pronunciation correctly over time  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=324) but that one the scattering from the  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=326) destruction of from hadrian was so  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=328) massive and also the times have changed  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=331) so much and the overwhelming power of  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=333) the roman empire and also the spreading  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=336) of christianity all of these things in a  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=338) complicated way  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=340) is  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=341) move the the scribes to  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=344) try to invent something  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=346) to  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=348) to make sure that the pronunciation is  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=350) correct  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=351) and then they did that that skill was  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=353) done in form of dots you can check now  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=355) any any old testament  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=357) uh heavy old testament  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=359) and you will see beside the the known  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=362) hebrew letters we can check in the  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=364) internet how their shape  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=366) their appearance they have dots on top  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=368) of them and bottom of them etcetera two  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=370) dots one dot three dots up down in the  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=372) triangular form and so on  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=374) these are the tashkeel so that skill was  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=377) dotting  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=379) that if he was nothing  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=383) my hypothesis now which has to be enough  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=385) to do some historical scrutiny if the  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=388) narration that obamacare is the one who  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=390) first taught them was five  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=393) even if that's not the case  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=398) in the case of being the first to  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=400) dramatically some subject some cream  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=404) and there are some some stories about  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=405) the the forms of dragon from kabu she's  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=408) having this daughting and so on  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=411) away in the quran before he became  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=413) muslim he became after battle he did not  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=415) catch mother but he became muslim before  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=418) and became the my main quran  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=423) was a jewish scholar and he was a high  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=425) level of scholarship  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=430) at that time already the thing by the  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=432) way the the jews i just mentioned a few  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=434) minutes ago  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=435) started like say in the  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=437) second maybe first century after  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=439) christ's second century and was almost  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=442) perfected maybe 200 300 after christ so  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=445) when islam came it was perfect it was  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=448) established technology  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=451) and almost certainly  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=454) did  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=456) they they did master that like any other  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=459) uh or went through the jewish madras and  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=462) he definitely went through the joke with  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=463) us there's no doubt that he went through  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=465) that even as she delivered scholarship  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=467) there's no doubt  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=471) so if he is the one who started that  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=473) then he must have said oh  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=476) there may be some people who are not as  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=478) good in arabic and under and then the  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=480) probable pronunciation let me not at  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=482) least my copy so it is the proper  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=484) conversation as i heard and i received  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=486) from  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=487) and repeated to him  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=489) or at least the version i repeated him  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=491) so he dotted it in that sense  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=493) meaning tashkeen using dots  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=496) the hebrew styles  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=499) some people say you know it is actually  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=500) later  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=501) and also we have the problems that later  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=504) maybe  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=512) some people  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=513) obviously they're trying to attribute  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=515) some some  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=516) some virtues or judge who doesn't  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=518) deserve maybe he he tried to  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=522) to make his his  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=523) his image nicer by claiming  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=526) as we know all tires like look at that  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=528) time  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=529) attire  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=530) and that and the enemy of islam and  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=532) muslim like  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=533) establishing the  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=534) king fahad  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=536) quran center in madina which produces  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=538) and prince  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=540) the most marvelous and beautifully  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=541) printed quran  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=543) that does not mean  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=544) believes in the quran  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=550) you have to present yourself to the  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=552) public as a pious one answer and give  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=554) yourself some some some islamic color  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=557) even if you are a tyrant  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=559) yeah it's not to be excluded i wouldn't  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=561) regard it as a really a world shuttling  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=563) uh problem if the hajjaj also the one  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=566) who was started or tried to  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=568) to make doting universal  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=571) so what is meaning from that time  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=574) who died in the late time of mine like a  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=576) year 32 until the time this happened  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=579) after hajjaj like the year hundreds of  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=581) the 70 years what is the doting mean i  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=584) would say most likely it meaning dotting  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=586) tashkeel in form of dots most likely in  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=588) in imported from the jews which is  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=590) perfectly fine people have perfected a  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=593) technique  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=594) and the language is similar to arabic  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=595) and they don't have they have they have  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=597) the usual harakat or arabic they have  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=600) them  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=602) unfortunately or maybe fortunately they  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=604) don't have these uh these uh these uh  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=607) that that's essentially what we have in  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=609) english uh we have in english a little  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=611) bit more we have the light a  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=613) men  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=614) we have men we have men we have man we  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=616) have one  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=630) may have something like that but anyway  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=632) at that time  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=633) they have  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=634) essentially the same tashkeep  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=636) either  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=639) the main castle although some  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=641) pronunciation and some tribes sometimes  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=643) make a difference between the main  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=645) customer and the half kaswa like men and  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=647) men or something like that but this is a  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=649) minor value and this is you see also in  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=651) the quran reading in the alif we have  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=654) for example uh  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=656) you have in the reading of verse you  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=657) have for example you have for example uh  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=660) in places uh you say for example  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=663) and have some reading about things  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=665) somebody somebody didn't go over the  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=667) quran say  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=668) with an inclination to move to the  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=671) something like that but this is mine  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=673) obviously i guess it's just minor  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=675) phonetical pronunciation the main  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=677) phonetic one in arabic essentially  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=682) that's it and the same in hebrew so it  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=685) is reasonable to import that and use it  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=687) but then  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=688) there's a problem with the arabic  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=690) writing with the dots the intrinsic dots  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=692) of this called the intrinsic dots of the  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=695) of the characters  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=699) it could mix up with these dots so what  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=701) to do what to do  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=706) people later i don't know how the  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=708) transition happened we have i don't  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=710) think there's any historical things  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=711) about that mostly they say okay  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=713) this will confuse you the daughter in  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=715) the heart so what to do instead of two  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=717) dots on top of something we connect the  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=719) two dots and they're like a slash that's  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=721) what we've had  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=722) and three dots which will move with a  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=724) bomb we make it like a like a uh  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=727) like a hat or then turn it later into a  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=730) wall and so on so they change the form  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=732) from the dots into the harakat we have  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=735) now  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=736) and possibly made they abolish the three  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=738) dots and they instead substituted a wall  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=740) for a small wall and things like that  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=743) that was a transition later because it  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=745) turns out to be it is for  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=748) you for remember that in the uh starting  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=750) the year 60 70 80 most muslims are now  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=753) known arabs and they are in arabic a  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=755) second language  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=756) and uh and uh even the muslims of the  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=759) north outside arabia are nabat and  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=761) nabata having actually even before  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=763) before islam yeah  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=765) a dialect which is not really high  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=767) arabic zero arabic and so on so you  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=770) cannot rely on on on the people's sense  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=773) and  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=774) and uh and the  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=776) mastery of arabic from birth on uh to  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=778) distinguish these things so you have you  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=780) have to adjust to this reality so i  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=782) think that's what the terms of these the  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=784) so the nothing mentioned  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=786) later i think it's the  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=789) most probable not with attitude but with  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=791) highest probability  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=793) that later dotting is almost certainly  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=797) related to tashkeel and the word dotting  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=799) is used because it was originally  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=801) imported  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=802) uh from hebrew  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=804) which has developed that into a high  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=806) level of sophistication which is no  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=807) problem  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=811) from people  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=812) who have  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=830) and that place is not the high arabic  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=831) place  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=833) the  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=834) more high arabic would have been south  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=836) arabia  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=837) the so-called muslim  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=840) script i can't put you down with some  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=842) some examples  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=843) which has nothing to do with no shame  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=845) you cannot recognize because most of you  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=847) have studied quran in madras and so on  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=850) you recognize the arabic shape these are  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=852) completely different shapes a similar  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=854) movement for ethiopian and and african  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=856) shapes and things like that but that  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=859) they did not for reason allah knows  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=861) better maybe part of the miracle in the  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=863) quran they did not import although there  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=865) is a closure to be hacked to the higher  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=867) arabic although it's another variation  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=872) but somehow  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=875) and syriac although it is far away from  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=877) arabic than the south arabic  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=880) of hemia and so on yes the old arabic  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=882) mohamed may be far away but  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=884) at the time before like the same time or  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=886) the arabic script was developed like  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=888) let's say three centuries two centuries  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=890) four centuries before islam  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=893) the south was speaking essentially the  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=894) arabic of the north with some variation  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=897) and  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=898) a and modification like instead of  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=900) bakara they say  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=901) things like that but there's very little  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=903) modification  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=905) and we don't have any report that the  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=907) sahaba there were other people going to  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=909) the yemen or the people coming from  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=910) yemen to madina and going to sham for  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=912) fighting had any difficulty  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=914) communicating with the people of the  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=915) north of any significance yeah there  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=917) were variations and variations of of  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=921) of of  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=922) the alex and so on but not to the  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=924) extreme i think the variation with here  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=926) and about is bigger  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=928) so somehow  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=930) the script of hera is the one who was  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=932) imported to makkah and the one which is  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=934) the quran came down with it not the one  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=938) for wisdom of allah we don't know maybe  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=940) something miraculous behind the scene  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=942) something metaphysical which we we  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=944) we can only see the physical side of it  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=946) in the development  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=948) if you look at the muslims maybe it's  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=949) not it does not  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=952) adjust very well for the quranic  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=954) revolution we don't know this is purely  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=956) speculative  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=957) but here i think adjust very nicely  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=959) especially with this the intrinsic  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=961) dotting of the letters and the lack of  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=963) test  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=965) now  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=969) is the problem  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=970) but this again is really not a problem  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=973) it may be a problem which comes to the  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=975) arab to the end of the words  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=977) internally the internal part of the  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=979) world is not a problem like for example  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=981) uh let's say florida well fajr while  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=984) they are in asheville  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=986) you can read and water while winter  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=989) water with fatiha or winter it's too  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=991) very linguistic variation of water  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=993) meaning  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=994) odd instead of odan even or waiter is  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=996) odd or single and the uh and even is  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1000) whatever shepherd  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1002) is is  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1003) uh  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1004) is even  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1009) okay so what our winter doesn't make any  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1012) difference the question is that at the  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1014) end of the words it may affect  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1017) the alap  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1019) is it is it an is it an is it is it is  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1023) it nominative is it accusative is it  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1025) that if it is degenerative and may  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1027) affect the meaning  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1029) but look at it in all places the quran  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1031) the various places of possibility  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1035) the same life with the influencing  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1037) daughter if you go there and change the  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1038) air up  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1039) either you get utter nonsense or you get  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1042) another variation of the meaning which  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1043) may make sense let me give you another  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1045) aspect  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1046) and who said that the the if the quran  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1049) is a revelation that allah is not  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1050) capable of allowing these two readings  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1052) so you have two possible readings  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1055) and also possible meanings  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1058) so one  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1060) one apparently sentence  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1062) gives you two aspects of a certain more  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1064) complex reality yeah wouldn't that be by  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1067) the water  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1068) the additional narrations or the  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1070) additional um  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1072) recitations wouldn't they be  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1074) transmitted through the water  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1077) leave the and now i'm just saying  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1078) if it is exist let's just just make it  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1081) purely if it exists it exists we have we  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1084) have various readers for example certain  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1086) places where they have variation they  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1087) can water all winter this is narrated  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1091) but all of them say one week  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1105) and interestingly  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1106) another  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1118) the other reading possible reading  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1119) linguistically by another tashkeel is  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1121) that  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1124) as in apostle nobody will be punished as  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1126) his punishment  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1128) meaning the kafir and the general  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1130) reading of all the readers  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1134) nobody  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1142) the other one  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1144) nobody will be punished like his  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1145) punishment for the one who is being  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1146) punished  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1147) the second one has been narrated by  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1149) nobody said it could have made a perfect  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1152) meaning but i will never read with that  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1154) because i have not don't receive it from  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1156) and nobody has read with that because  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1158) quran is being by narration not by by  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1161) just linguistic possibility  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1163) that's what i said  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1166) in that case the first reading which is  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1168) the standard reading  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1174) will punish punishment which nobody  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1176) can't punish like him it's clear they  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1178) correctly benefit the reason nobody  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1179) can't punish cycle of iran and nobody  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1181) can tie down like a lot  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1184) the other reading does not does not add  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1187) any really  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1189) so nobody narrated it for example but  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1194) if you if you read it or you by mistake  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1197) you read it and so on you still haven't  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1199) have a good meaning for it  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1201) that the kafir would be punished the  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1202) punishment which nobody would vanish  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1204) like him yeah because the one who  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1205) punishing him is the one who punishes  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1207) the punishment nobody will be able to  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1208) punish but it is it doesn't add anything  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1211) significant  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1212) so we'll come to tawata now so even in  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1216) that  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1219) there's  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1220) little doubt  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1222) that even a variation there  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1224) if it makes good sense and give another  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1226) aspect of the meaning  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1228) is  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1231) can be assumed to be divinely intended  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1236) okay  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1237) so it is through the claim it is not  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1239) called honor it is not the reveal it's a  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1240) mistake it's to start with from  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1242) philosophical and fundamental point of  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1244) view  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1246) now  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1247) the other question that should i read  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1249) that way should i use such a reading is  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1252) that is that permissible from you such a  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1254) reading  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1255) and  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1256) and uh  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1257) and uh  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1258) attributed to a quran  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1260) i would i would uh hold the whole this  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1263) time because they the classical scholar  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1265) said for a reading to be a permissible  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1267) or acceptable as a quran is that it has  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1269) to be  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1270) fitting with the rothmania script even  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1274) if only in a possibility like foreign  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1288) say because the mad the the soft letters  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1291) in arabic matters  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1293) you you can be  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1295) easily ignored or this is clear even in  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1298) the writing  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1300) is i think as a rahman and nobody is a  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1302) rahman  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1316) is  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1322) so the scholars conclude from that by  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1324) necessity that  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1325) you can add them and distract them if  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1328) narrated they come and they will come to  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1329) the second condition  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1330) without uh  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1332) being uh going out of south side of the  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1334) quran  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1335) that's what they mean  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1337) there's a possibility that it fits the  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1338) script because the script is having the  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1340) possibility of against the destruction  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1342) of the intrinsic dotting and the  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1344) possibility of adding and substracting  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1346) alif wow and yeah  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1349) the the the soft ones the extension ones  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1352) [Music]  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1355) all right yeah there's no health there's  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1357) nothing  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1358) no rahim  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1362) and so on  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1364) so so that's the first condition second  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1366) condition it has to be uh narrated  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1369) it has been reported  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1372) with a connected reliable it's not it is  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1375) it has to it has to go all the way to  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1377) the raft outside  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1379) these are the condition for that for  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1381) that  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1382) so if it is not reported even if it fits  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1384) throughout many uh  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1387) uthmani uh writing  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1390) alan  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1391) then uh it is called singular reading  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1393) and uh they regard it it's not the quran  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1396) that's that's what they concluded and we  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1398) have a historic case that in the in the  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1401) fourth century a man called evil  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1404) famous leader  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1406) chose to read the surah in swords yusuf  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1409) when the brothers reviews have left him  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1411) and the quran says for namaste whether  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1414) he come when he gave up that they would  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1415) listen to them because they said please  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1417) take one of us instead of you instead of  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1419) beijing  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1420) i mean take a take someone of us his  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1423) father is an old man he will collapse he  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1425) knows this girls this young boy is gone  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1427) take one of us and said say how can i  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1429) take anyone for they don't commit any  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1431) crime you know that plot of you sir no  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1433) no no there's no way and they tried  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1435) every way of thick in the book there's  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1436) no way to persuade yousef to to let  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1440) me lose most likely  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1442) must have been laughing at that time  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1444) because he was he knows about the plot  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1446) with you  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1447) and then who they gave up and then they  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1449) they they left  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1452) talking to each other  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1453) [Music]  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1469) this this invention booth  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1474) was a great arabic  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1477) specialist and have an enormous arabic  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1479) taste and such a style almost close to  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1481) the quran beauty  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1483) because he just derived from the quran  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1485) the beauty of expression  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1487) he said this idiot does all that he said  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1489) he did not say discover  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1491) insisted  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1493) you can't because if you remove the dots  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1498) they are very young  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1502) what's  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1503) look at this  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1504) look at this idiot  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1506) what is the benefit of knowing that they  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1508) started to talk to each other and say  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1511) what they should we say to our father  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1512) about this calamity while they're  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1514) writing them it doesn't add anything to  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1516) the story why najib makes sense  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1520) now we are stuck and the oldest one said  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1522) no no no i'm not going to go back go to  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1524) your father say your son  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1525) and ask verify as witnesses what i'm  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1528) saying here until he gives me send me a  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1529) permission to go back but i'm not going  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1531) to go back that makes sense make much  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1533) better sense  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1534) so this idiot i'll say this i wouldn't  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1536) say this catherine this time  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1539) they made their  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1541) a session of a court session for him and  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1544) forced him to  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1546) to recount and repent otherwise they  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1548) declare him catholic anyway i wouldn't  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1550) go to this extreme  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1552) i said did you see him  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1556) i'll let you save him  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1558) because there's no good reason for that  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1560) it doesn't add anything to the problem  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1562) but doesn't mutilate the quran either  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1569) so i would say  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1570) this issue  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1573) i think some you can't blow it out of  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1575) proportion you can get it lesser than  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1578) its proportion  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1581) i wouldn't go overboard with it i would  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1583) say  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1584) it is  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1586) all these are uh  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1588) are intended or may be intended and one  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1591) one good verification a way to say which  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1592) one are intended is that how much or  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1594) what which one is is being is being  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1597) narrated  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1599) what has been narrated  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1601) now the question of narration there's  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1602) also a general fiction that these days  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1604) seven readings or the 10 reasons  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1609) the problem  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1610) is  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1612) from whom this reading has been taken  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1615) now the imam himself  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1616) has been taken from various mushrooms  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1620) we don't know about his methodology did  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1622) he show us from the show or did they  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1624) agree on certain because every imam  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1627) they agree almost every in the quran let  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1629) us face it they claim that their  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1631) variation has reading  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1634) let me just that's just aberration  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1635) reading first  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1636) let me address that most validation  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1638) readings  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1642) the way you do it musically  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1644) like  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1645) how long you stretch an a  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1647) what about  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1649) lean six  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1651) six finger movements or four and so on i  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1653) would discount i don't i wouldn't  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1655) frankly i wouldn't bother about that  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1657) this adds to the beauty of that although  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1660) the scholars of the reading claim that  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1662) is this is important for beauty of the  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1664) quran it's revealed like that i would  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1666) say this is going to extreme it the  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1668) revelation contains that allows that i  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1670) don't think it's a compulsory in the  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1672) sense that you are sinful or a criminal  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1674) or by writing in the quran  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1679) and some people criticize washington  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1682) making long long extension longer than  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1684) this  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1689) that's ada most of it said that but  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1691) there are differences in far surf  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1708) from various from various statements of  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1710) him  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1712) specifically we know that he said here  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1714) is only what he has heard from so many  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1716) people that has started for him  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1722) is um  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1728) yeah i think he's  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1730) or he's a junior tabi so he met  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1733) i'm not sure if he met some sahaba  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1737) but he met numerous people  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1739) who themselves have taken voyeur  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1741) standards  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1742) so someone could say  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1744) as like i i i was like a measuring stick  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1747) because he said clearly he will never  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1749) read except what he has not heard from  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1751) al-qaeda  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1753) from everyone although he has in mataram  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1755) ada  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1757) thinks which differentiator for example  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1760) he has the code that  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1762) is that  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1764) put into letters and merging them  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1766) together even if they are separated with  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1767) hawaii we know that  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1769) the usual israel like for example um  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1772) [Music]  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1775) we have a scramble we don't have this  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1776) camera example  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1793) a super and the next letter of the first  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1795) letter of the next word is the same  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1796) letter so you can put them together and  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1798) make sure that in pronunciation  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1804) i know no examples coming from my mind  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1817) even if the end letter of one word is  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1818) having  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1820) and the next  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1823) nobody will do islam usually in the most  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1825) arabic conversation  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1828) to drop that haraka and merge the two  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1830) gem and make shadda  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1833) it doesn't know  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1842) and the second letter is having haraka  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1845) but that the first letter  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1846) is is is  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1849) and the second letter is the same letter  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1851) with another haragawa what is it there  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1853) nobody does  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1854) because it is  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1856) plenty of that is unlikely that he took  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1858) that from torah so he regarded that as  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1861) a matter of beautiful pronunciation or a  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1863) matter of musical is regarded as as  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1866) musically acceptable or something like  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1868) that and he may have heard some arabs so  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1870) he regarded us as permissible  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1872) ah that's at that condition for reading  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1874) it should be acceptable as an arabic  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1876) possible reading allowed by the arabic  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1878) language  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1879) at least even if it's one it's a one one  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1882) of its acceptable dialects one is the  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1884) fossil dialects  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1887) so uh  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1888) so even abu lada but as in ada as  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1904) attributing their punishment to allah or  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1907) their passive reform attributed  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1908) eventually to the punished one  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1911) that uh that he  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1912) pronounced clearly that he will never  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1914) read anything which he did not take from  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1915) from the majority of the old from the  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1918) calf or from the  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1919) public from everyone  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1921) we can't take him in virtual roof we  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1923) can't take him as a measure what is  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1925) really by toronto but it's not  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1927) necessarily really that every every  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1929) single reading from the seven every bit  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1932) there and every one piece of partial  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1934) roof is going through the water it may  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1936) be going to one year to one or two  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1937) channels of narration there is no  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1939) necessity no it's not  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1942) no no no reason to believe that because  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1944) we don't know if the imam  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1946) insisted on the water or not we know for  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1949) example that  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1950) which is a master madani reading had at  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1953) least four or five shaykhs  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1956) is that toronto and we don't know if he  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1958) insisted to take only what they agreed  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1961) upon maybe he issues from one of them  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1965) his methodology is not very clear  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1967) as far as i know  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1969) according to my limited knowledge there  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1970) i'm not specialist of reading but  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1973) it's not clear that  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1975) they said he read on this on this on  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1977) this on this  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1980) we found we find for example uh like the  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1983) illegals say this one reader that on  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1985) this and this and yesterday for example  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1987) this one has that  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1993) from these four for example  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1995) and another people took us from these  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1996) four and others for example another  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1998) other mix usually they take for more  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=1999) than four usually have more than sheikh  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2002) and they see the other either they have  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2003) variations so where the variation comes  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2006) from  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2007) maybe the variation is from these four  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2009) original  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2012) so to summarize  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2014) i would not bother about this variation  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2016) very much i would say whatever has come  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2018) from variation or we can construct which  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2020) fits all these three principles it has  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2022) to it has to fit the writing  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2026) even with it with a probability meaning  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2029) if if we  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2030) if we remove the intrinsic dots and put  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2033) intrinsic dots number one secondly if we  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2035) allow us to remove or add the soft  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2037) letters  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2040) which is evidenced by necessity by  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2041) rahman rahman etc  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2051) actually we should have been reading  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2053) rahman but because all  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2055) reader without exception  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2058) would  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2063) we have to comply and add that alif  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2066) uh mentally report in pronunciation  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2069) while marik the majority read malik not  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2071) malik so the reading of house is  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2074) is  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2075) is alice this uh as i discussed either  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2078) if you remember we discussed in the in  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2080) the beginning  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2082) i prefer ma malik definitely  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2085) because marik will will  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2092) which is uh  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2093) fit through the principles of general  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2094) readings does not give so much extra  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2097) meaning like marik because malik is  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2114) the king and the ruler in addition to be  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2116) just the owner  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2118) which is malik for example  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2121) so  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2122) i would i would put the general  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2123) hypothesis all of these variations and  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2126) as far as they are valid  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2128) and cannot be rejected on on compelling  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2132) ground  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2135) we can assume that they are intended in  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2136) generation  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2138) if someone came otherwise  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2140) they are village they are quran they  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2141) entered the revolution  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2142) otherwise he has to bring the evidence  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2144) like in the case of uh  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2146) image from booth  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2148) when the guy gave up they they moved  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2151) they they they got they got away juno  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2154) won  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2156) uh  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2157) nojobian instead of uh najib instead of  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2160) the discussing with each other which is  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2161) clearly uh indicated by the next ayah uh  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2164) najib one riding their their comments  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2168) yeah maybe they were maybe they were  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2170) adding their donkeys  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2171) that doesn't give us any any relevant on  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2174) it so could say we should reject that  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2176) one as a singular reading  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2179) but declare him to be a kafir and may  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2181) make a a causation to try him and and  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2184) threaten him with execution if he  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2186) doesn't listen i wouldn't go that far  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2189) but at that time the people were  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2191) was stuck-minded in these things you  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2193) kind of cannot believe that because the  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2195) quran has such holiness and protection  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2197) nobody want to approach but but i think  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2200) it's an extreme  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2202) it could be maybe  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2204) maybe it is it's one of the possibility  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2206) of intended by the quran and unless we  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2209) find for example an initial parchment in  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2212) which we found the space specifically or  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2214) this ayah and it is dotted as najib only  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2218) but maybe not in that place maybe it's  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2219) physically not telling us don't read it  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2222) otherwise otherwise  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2224) i would declare mr vision as maybe as an  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2227) idiot but not as a cuffs  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2232) [Music]  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2241) [Music]

[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/V5VUEi_us-c?t=2285) so
