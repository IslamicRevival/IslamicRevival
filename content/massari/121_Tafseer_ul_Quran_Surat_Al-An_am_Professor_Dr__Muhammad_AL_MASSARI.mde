He notes that, if the Divine being necessarily exists, then it must know everything. He goes on to explain that, even though the things of the future do not yet exist, they will exist at some point in eternity.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=300)* Discusses the various contradictions found in pantheism. It points out that pantheism is an atheism based on the assumption that everything exists without God's intervention.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=600)* Discusses the various dangers of discussing matters related to the future, or qadar, without first understanding the meaning of fundamental qadar.

He explains that in sleep, you are basically half-dead, whereas in death, you are truly dead. He also discusses the miraculous nature of death, which is not nearly as devastating as people might think.

Dr. Massari explains that Allah sends people up "in the day" when they are asleep, meaning He receives them then. He also explains that some people believe that Allah's decrees are already fixed at the beginning of the universe, but this is not the case. Everything is constantly being recalculated and advanced according to Allah's will.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=1500)** , which is a lecture by Dr. Muhammad Al Massari, discusses the meaning of Surat Al-An'am and what to expect during the final days. Dr. Massari explains that while death is definitely real, it is not the final end. He goes on to discuss the significance of charity and how it can help extend lives. Finally, he addresses the issue of false belief in divine beings, noting that it is impossible for such beings to exist.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=1800)**  presents a lecture on Surat al-An'am by Islamic scholar Dr. Muhammad al Massari.

* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=2100)* Discusses the idea that after death, the souls of believers go to Heaven or Hell. Angels play a significant role in this process, and some angels are considered to be ugly.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=2400)** discusses the role of Allah in saving humans from danger, and how those who call on Him in humility and secrecy can be grateful. He also reminds the listener that even if someone denies the existence of God, Allah can still help in times of need.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=2700)* Discusses accidents and records of people screaming during them. It goes on to talk about a recent record of a mental patient crashing a laboratory in Germany and how the recordings show that people were screaming.  concludes by saying that only God can save someone in such a situation and that attributing Divinity to others besides Him is a form of shirk (paganism).
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=3000)* Discusses the Islamic concept of qisas, or "retribution," and how it relates to the three punishments mentioned in the Quran: suffering from above, from below, and between people. It also mentions a narration which states that Allah made it easier for believers to avoid being split into groups by preventing Muhammad from saying all the way "chica," or "if he ever said."
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=3300)** The Ayah in question is about how Allah will not punish a people for their wrong actions if they have accepted His revelation. This is in contrast to how people will continue to be punished for their wrong actions even if they have accepted the revelation.


Dr. Muhammad Al Massari explains that this is because people are only able to understand the consequences of their actions after they have experienced them first-hand. Once people have experienced the consequences of their actions, they will be more inclined to repent.

* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=3900)* Discusses the prohibition against making fun of or mocking Allah or His messenger. It clarifies that this prohibition is particularly relevant in Medina and Madina, where Muhammad and his companions were more likely to be exposed to such mockery. If someone does make fun of Allah or His messenger, he is told to stand up and leave.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=4200)* Discusses the importance of admonishing wrongdoers so that they may become conscious of God. It explains that this is a duty that is not limited to those who are responsible for what others do, but is a reminder to all. It also points out that this can have a positive effect, and that it is important to continue doing this even if it is a small reminder.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=4500)** 
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=4800)**  a professor discusses the Ayah in Surat Al-An'am which states that if someone mocks the Prophet (PBUH), they should leave Medina and object to that mockery from afar. He goes on to say that this Ayah does not mean that the Prophet (PBUH) wanted anyone to personally mock him. Instead, he wanted people to leave Medina and object to any mockery that took place there. The professor also discusses the Hadith in which the Prophet (PBUH) is said to have killed a woman who was insulting him. However, it is unclear whether he ordered her death or if someone helped him do so.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=5100)* Discusses how Islam has been forgotten and nobody ever bothered to discuss it's place in society, nationalism, socialism, and capitalism. It goes on to say that this has resulted in general discord and wars, and that this is because the way Professor Dr. Muhammad AL MASSARI formulated his argument was to incite war against Muslims and against Iran. He argues that he didn't read the argument in its entirety, but that it is still in support of active war.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=5400)** discusses some of the theological schools of thought that have views similar to their own on the matter of NADA (No God allowed). also comments on the fact that the earlier interpretations of these schools were not always precise.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=5700)** discusses a Hadith in which the Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who wants to come to power legitimately should first seek approval from Allah. He goes on to say that this issue has never been discussed except among "respectable" people, and that the disease of rebellion has begun with this misunderstanding.
* **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=6000)* Discusses a Hadith in which the Prophet Muhammad said that the most destroyed of people are those who reject the truth. It then goes on to discuss the etiquettes around discussing this Hadith with people.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=6300)* Discusses the difference between what Muhammad al-Massari says when he is not debating, and when he is debating. al-Massari argues that when one is not debating, they are simply attacking their opponents, which is wrong.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=6600)**  Professor Dr. Muhammad al Massari discusses the difference between mockery and criticism. He says that mockery is less serious than criticism, and that it is important to be sincere and truthful when engaging in debate. He explains that the definition of mockery is more specific than the definition of criticism, and that it is clear from the Qur'an what it means to mock someone. He concludes by saying that being sincere and truthful are the two important factors in any debate.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opiqJ46CVg&t=6900)* Discusses the difference between mockery and criticism, and argues that mockery is not appropriate when discussing the Divine. then goes on to explain that if one drops the assumption that Jesus is Divine, then there is no need for the acrobatic claims made about Him in the Bible.

In this lecture, Dr. Muhammad AL MASSARI discusses the 121 Tafseer ul Quran Surat Al-An'am. He covers the meaning and significance of the Surat, as well as its implications for modern day debates.

He goes on to say that when debating with others, it is important to be truthful and sincere, avoiding insult and abusive language. Tamia is using abusive language and argumentation to put her opponents in the corner, while Al Massari has a double standard, insulting his opponents while insisting they are having a "session of enjoyment." This is not debating, but rather abusing the other side.

[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=120) this is the year has to be mentioned  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=121) anyway uh we we should quickly visit the  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=125) eye of last time which is an important  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=127) one about the keys of the Unseen when  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=129) the festival is  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=139) a quick comment and continue  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=142) but for with him are the keys to the  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=144) things that are beyond the reach of  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=145) created beings perception none knows him  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=148) but he and he knows all that is on the  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=150) land on land and in the sea and not only  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=153) Falls but he knows it and neither is  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=155) there a grain in the earth deep Darkness  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=157) nor anything living or dead but is  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=159) recorded in his clear decree  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=162) a translation he holds the keys to the  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=163) unknown no one knows these keys but him  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=166) he knows all that is on land and in the  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=168) sea and lots of leaf rules without him  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=170) knowing about it there is not a grain in  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=173) the earth's deep Darkness or anything  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=175) living or dead that is not written in a  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=177) clear record  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=179) so this is a clarifies as we said as I  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=182) said as I'm glad as many issues of  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=183) so-called Divine foreign  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=189) if we talk about absolute time which is  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=192) essentially nothing they can accept the  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=193) expression of the Divine activity  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=196) according to the Hadith which as I said  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=198) is a miraculous Hadith because nobody at  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=201) the time or before has ever exists  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=204) something like that that I am the time  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=206) either 10 day and night by my command  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=208) this definition of time is this  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=210) completely alien to all human beings at  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=212) that time that couldn't be Possible's  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=215) mind on on kind of be from the people of  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=218) the book because it's not to take things  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=220) from the people of the book but this is  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=222) very clearly it's not on this type  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=223) because the beginning of starts quite  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=225) innocently it says  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=228) um the son of Adam hears me or insults  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=231) me by saying what a miserable time  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=233) down with the time things like that  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=236) failure over the time and things like  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=238) that and this is insulting me because I  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=240) am the type and that the escalation come  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=242) which is all bothering with the  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=244) miraculous I am the time  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=246) because the meaning of that I attend day  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=248) and night they are nice office in the  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=250) way we count time so this is mentioned  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=252) such an event it couldn't have said that  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=254) how how electrons surround the atom that  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=257) nobody has concept of that so the  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=259) simplest thing should be what I did to  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=261) time and time healing is there an  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=263) entertaining of the earth that's the  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=265) best gaming device we have until now by  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=267) the way  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=268) even better than atomic clocks  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=272) my activity by commanding and they said  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=276) with so many scores and questions that  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=277) relations of divine phone knowledge  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=280) because somehow before that some people  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=282) because if the Divine being because  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=285) necessarily existing has knowledge then  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=287) he must know everything and they thought  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=289) everything extends also the things of  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=290) the future but the things do not exist  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=293) yet  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=293) until Allah desired them to create them  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=297) but in eternity when zero obsolete  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=300) existence  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=302) the vision was not yet made what should  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=304) we have created which Universe should be  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=306) created and when the university created  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=307) was created by structure by smackadir so  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=310) there is individual events could vary  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=312) depending upon conditions and point  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=314) three words of certain actions and also  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=316) Allah's Free Will so if things in the  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=318) future is always fixed or eternity which  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=320) is amazingly observed meaning these  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=322) things somehow exist without Allah's  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=324) interaction or allowed to so there are  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=327) some things recently existing that's  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=329) what led some people to argue for  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=331) pantheism like for example I didn't  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=333) mention last time the community they  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=335) could not have an Arabi uh  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=339) who is actually  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=341) amazingly but these issues he's gone far  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=345) away of tangent he says things are well  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=349) established in Adam in nothingness  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=351) what's meaning things  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=353) and then later on Allah ordered them to  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=356) come to exist so they exist if they will  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=358) establishing nothing it is which is  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=360) obviously contradiction the statement  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=362) that's one example there's a good  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=364) example of the stated which  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=365) linguistically have no problem there's  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=367) acquisitive adaptive negative and so on  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=369) but the reality refers to nothing is  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=372) absolutely nonsensical  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=375) and then I'll let them give them  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=376) existence or they'll establish nothing  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=378) that don't exist how they they are known  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=380) all these contradictions come under  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=382) because of that and everything is  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=384) essentially the divine presence the  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=386) Divine entity the whole universe is  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=387) Allah and Allah is the universe are not  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=390) events and develop further into  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=392) pantheism so Allah is the universe Allah  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=394) I say  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=396) Etc which is  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=399) fundamentally distinct and made by Allah  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=402) could have could have been made  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=404) differently so it's created existing so  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=408) this Divine foreign Village will dictate  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=410) that everything exists really  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=413) present or established in nothingness  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=415) according to analogy just  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=418) flood flood develop the existence on  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=421) them so they are essentially part of the  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=423) Divine being but in that case  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=426) we don't need to talk about Divine  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=427) knowledge there's no full knowledge  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=428) everything is established we just it  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=430) flows from him so it's a mechanism it's  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=433) a nature so pantheism  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=435) is another version of atheism and that's  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=439) the reason Lydia said we discussed about  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=442) them say it's what a kind of a religious  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=445) version of atheism on materialism it's  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=448) just giving it a spiritual by calling  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=450) nature or metal god that's it but it's  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=453) nothing any God anymore because God is  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=455) something else God is by definition is a  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=458) free agent he's an active entity it is  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=461) the one who does whatever he wants and  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=464) he could forsake doing and do something  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=466) else and can make a decision and can  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=468) even abrogate his previous decisions  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=470) unless he has committed himself like 37  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=473) announcing a future event through his  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=475) Prophet no way the prophet would be  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=477) Aliah so that's an obligation a lot of  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=480) infinite there's no way also promises in  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=482) the future for rewarding the Believers  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=483) Allah will not fear his promise but he  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=485) got very well forsake his punishment  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=487) orders Etc then we mentioned that  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=490) casually so that's a different Divine  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=492) being and a free agent will absolutely  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=495) energy  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=496) which make him in not knowing the future  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=499) but in control of the he makes the  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=500) future  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=502) and if he makes it he knows it  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=504) but making Fast not knowing and not the  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=507) opposite otherwise you'll create  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=508) contradiction that he becomes that  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=510) notary agent and this and this and has  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=513) been noticeable with some other with  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=514) some Muslim Theologian in time past and  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=517) they mentioned that arazi came to this  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=520) point  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=521) in discussing uh  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=524) uh one of the most Academy and I think  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=526) which is called by by by Sunni the devil  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=531) of the attack of the Wyndham because he  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=532) used to be said in a window and  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=533) discussed with the persons but I think  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=535) theological things maybe that's the  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=537) reason I don't know if that's the reason  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=538) and the fear I call him movement attack  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=540) the believer of the window  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=542) because it was CA anyway it was  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=545) discussing that to Sean he said clearly  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=546) if we assume that all future events are  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=549) known as events in advance that Allah  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=551) has no frequent and his abacanism by  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=553) necessity and arazi mentioned this point  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=555) of view and say he didn't have an answer  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=557) to it any structured that's what he said  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=559) but we say what the majority they almost  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=561) say that Allah knows things in advance  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=563) and this is does not make him a  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=565) mechanism but is giving you a structured  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=567) argument that really do  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=570) compelling an unavoidable and structured  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=573) argument which some within a theologian  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=575) in the western philosopher have  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=577) recognized that is absolutely it's an  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=578) absolute argument there's no way to  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=580) defeat that argument so that's that's  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=582) that one is that is all these issues in  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=584) one goal completely essentially with  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=587) other eyes obviously we don't talk so  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=589) many villages in the world when I will  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=591) never sit in such a deep complex issue  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=592) but it gives you some aspects because  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=595) it's like a complex  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=596) multi-faceted uh uh figure and it gives  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=601) you quite a number of facets of these  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=603) figures and the other ones have to be  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=605) accepted from other places until you get  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=607) the picture in full and the main problem  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=609) with past Theologian and focus  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=611) unfortunately was that they did never  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=613) really kept the Quran in its totality  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=617) still respect they're focus on few eyes  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=619) and neglect others and this is condemned  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=622) as making the Quran taking make the  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=624) Quran lean making them pots but like  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=628) like an organism and dividing it in  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=630) parts and taking some parts and growing  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=633) other parts which with the result  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=635) it will lead to contradiction  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=638) and it will lead obviously to  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=640) misunderstanding the Quran and then  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=642) easily you can construct that  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=643) contraction then prove that color is not  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=645) from Allah but that's not the way it  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=647) works the Allah says  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=651) if it had been from from anybody else  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=654) except Allah there would be  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=655) contradiction there but that's what only  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=657) if you take it from A to Z press I to  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=660) the last I and see if you cannot  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=662) construct any control addiction  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=664) and that's what nobody ever succeeded  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=668) they can probably if you for the follow  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=669) what most Focus  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=671) Theologian and Thai bus have done then  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=674) you will ease the kosa consequential  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=676) elections unfortunately so we have to  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=679) avoid the strap of taking the Quran  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=681) earlier and we're trying in that of  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=682) series you see that we don't stick and  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=685) then even worse it goes to the extreme  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=688) that's sometimes the same Ayah or the  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=689) same context some sentences are taken  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=692) out of context  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=693) with a catastrophic result in various  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=695) places and we mentioned examine that by  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=697) verse and more examples can be the  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=699) future  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=700) okay so that's just a reminder of that  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=702) one which is the utmost importance and  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=705) then we have the writing about these  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=706) things we're developing it because this  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=708) is just such a  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=709) um a Minefield it has to be developed so  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=713) meticulously in all details are  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=714) discussing all the Hadith which  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=717) distinguish between  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=719) and realize all these are Hadith get all  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=722) the eyes on board and get all the issues  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=724) dictated by necessity of Visa like the  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=726) discussion I just said and others got  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=729) all of that and then to show the picture  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=731) in a clear and precise way inshallah and  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=734) this the writing is ongoing for that and  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=736) putting everything together is ongoing  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=738) but we're doing it as meticulous as  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=740) possible because this is really one of  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=741) the most  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=743) dangerous minefields you could walk if  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=746) you don't work properly there you will  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=747) be in trouble  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=748) foreign  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=753) discussing issues like that and he his  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=756) face was red as if he of his uh as if  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=760) smashed in his face and said is that  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=762) what you created for it don't strike  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=765) that I have come out against each other  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=766) whatever you know  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=768) and then say it what you don't know  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=769) refer it to other one who knows it and  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=772) London and he would make that rejection  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=773) don't discuss qadar  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=777) avoid discussion because anyone  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=778) discussing Qatar if he will be asked  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=781) about Yama  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=782) if you answered correctly then he  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=784) escapes you that's how strongly he will  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=786) be will be in trouble but if someone  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=788) does not discuss that and avoid it then  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=790) he will but obviously you have to know  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=792) the meaning of fundamentally as it's a  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=794) core and the core meaning is example the  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=796) prophet that you know what has happened  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=798) in the past could not have not happened  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=799) because Allah made the decision and this  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=802) is absolute and nothing Capital but  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=804) that's the meaning of God  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=806) about the future it doesn't relate to  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=809) that that's the reason the P1 I'll get  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=811) getting messing up of say through  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=812) believing  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=814) the Hadith of Amen is that you believe  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=817) in Allah his angels his Messengers his  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=820) books their judgment and  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=822) that all things which has happened and  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=825) happening now and in the past good or  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=827) evil depending on Independence of what's  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=829) good and evil is in your point of view  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=831) which may be deficient or is  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=832) fundamentally good and even in Allah  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=834) could not have happened without Allah's  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=837) permission that's it about the future  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=838) doesn't say anything  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=840) accept that because of the Divine  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=842) absolute dominance and absolute power  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=844) the future is under unlock control  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=847) he creates the future  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=850) and sometimes he postpone the creation  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=852) that is unknown until it's created and  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=855) this is clearly when you go there an  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=858) example of things have been postponed  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=860) Allah the capability to postpone a  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=862) decision even and decide later I'll keep  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=866) it open this is within within the Divine  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=868) dominance and absolute power  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=870) the resident Divine dominance the Divine  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=873) control of the future absolutely  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=874) dominance and making delusion and he  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=876) gave us the ability to make part of our  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=878) future at least our destiny we can make  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=881) our own history it's not really distant  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=883) literally is not fully distant that's  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=886) your choice that's your work  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=887) are you capable of doing that  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=890) and you'll be accounted for that and you  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=892) will not be escaped  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=893) he will show you the evidences that you  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=896) were mistaken if you refer things talk  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=898) about is not true  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=900) so now next is  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=904) foreign  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=919) and he  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=925) brings you back to life each days in  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=928) order that a term set by him be  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=930) fulfilled in the end unto him you must  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=933) return and then he will make you  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=935) understand all that you are doing  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=937) this translation it is he who calls your  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=940) soul back by night and knows what you  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=943) have done by day and he brings you back  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=945) to life each day until your fixed term  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=948) is fulfilled in the end you must return  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=951) to him and then he will make you  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=953) understand all that you were doing in  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=955) life and it'd be at the beginning of the  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=956) second translation what did he say about  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=958) the word falcon  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=959) it is he it is he who calls your souls  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=963) back by night and knows what you have  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=965) done by day and he brings you back to  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=968) life each day until your fixed term is  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=970) fulfilled  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=971) okay so they are struggling with a  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=974) little vacuum uh the second one is  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=977) closer to the meaning because they're  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=979) using some other place in the Quran  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=980) which is explain what is the welfare  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=982) means receiving  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=988) if you say I go to this guy I have a  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=991) this guy I owes me money I'm going to go  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=994) and receive the money from guys I'm  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=996) going to the receipt is is being praised  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=999) that he is he fulfilled all what he was  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1002) supposed to be doing he delivered  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1004) everything so delivering his wife is  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1006) receiving so rafaya  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1013) he receives you  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1016) at night the other is in other places  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1026) obviously the Consciousness he received  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1029) it in in time of death and thus was the  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1032) one who are not dying he also received  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1035) in some sense different than the  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1037) receiving in the case of that in the  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1038) case of sleep  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1040) you know in the case of sleep you are  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1042) like half dead you're not conscious  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1043) about to think about that you can you  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1046) may sleep 100 years  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1047) we have the example of the people in the  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1049) cave who slept with 100 years and they  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1051) thought they slept only for one day  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1053) because usual habit you sleep for one  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1055) day on a few are over exhausted after a  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1057) big strong struggle or a Escape maybe  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1059) escaming an enemy and running maybe for  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1062) one or two days without sleep then you  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1063) may assume okay I have slept maybe half  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1066) a day or a day and a half because of the  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1068) exhaustion but it will never come to New  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1070) senses that you have maybe been hundreds  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1073) of years in sleep  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1075) and the people like hey we don't know  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1077) that they die really or they were  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1079) sleeping only  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1081) as simply they were sleeping but in a  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1083) deep sleep like a coma in such a way  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1086) possibly all their life functions were  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1087) so far down  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1090) I'm still most miraculous  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1092) it's miraculous it's not almost as  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1093) devastating miraculous because you  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1095) cannot that's always you know you can't  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1096) slow processes so down  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1099) that it goes for 300 years you may slow  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1103) it down so that cost me a few several  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1104) months like some some Hindu yoga  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1107) specialist and so on Extreme by extreme  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1110) trading and so on they can they have  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1112) been locked in Graves and so on  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1114) obviously under supervision medical and  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1116) the scholars over vision for months  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1118) without food and so on and by putting  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1120) themselves in something like a deep  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1122) sleep until the heartbeat was measured  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1124) and through 2020 I think that one  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1126) heartbeat every every minute instead of  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1128) 60 and so on so instead of sleeping one  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1130) day you can sleep 60 days everything is  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1133) stitched all biological processes are  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1134) slowed down but I'm doubtful that yeah  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1138) that you can do it actually if I'm not  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1141) mistaken some bacteria  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1143) have been found which have been  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1144) encapsulated  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1146) by a last design obviously to keep it  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1148) forward so we can detect it today  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1150) encapsulated in in certain uh in such a  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1154) way in Iraq on with it were taken out  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1156) for 200 billion years because the rock  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1159) age can be determined by and the  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1161) surrounding area can be determined but  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1163) it was done so gently obviously it was  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1165) not obviously a subject total to  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1167) volcanic activity or any other activity  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1169) but just sedimentary activity  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1171) sedimentation and hardening and that one  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1173) was not crushed like in a bubble of  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1176) water or something like that and then  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1178) the bacteria went almost like dead  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1181) but when they opened it came again to  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1184) life they would divide 200 million years  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1186) if I'm not mistaken one of the bacterias  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1189) which we have in the gut for example  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1190) that was what happened if I'm not  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1192) mistaken so it is very well possible  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1194) that even it goes like that so the  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1197) borderline between sleep and death is  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1200) at least for simple organisms is almost  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1203) fluent almost there's no demarcation  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1206) line but anyway for us  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1209) Allah said I receive you at night  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1211) meaning when you're asleep obviously  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1214) like a day  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1218) so he's the one who received this now I  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1219) know what you are doing that day  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1225) and here they select you in the day from  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1227) the sleep it is bad it's like the  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1228) resurrection he wakes you up he gets you  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1231) up but the meaning uh is is uh is uh  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1236) about ascending send you up  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1239) his bath is not resurrection and  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1241) detecting consists like after being  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1244) disintegrated no but it can be very like  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1246) for example uh say this man was was  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1249) sitting calmly I came up with with the  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1252) news and he was so excited that he  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1254) jumped on us  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1256) he he raised up he  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1260) standing because of the news the bad  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1263) news are good news some bad so bad  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1265) meaningless getting out of a situation  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1267) into another more exciting story that's  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1269) it so he selected you or is you up in in  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1273) the day fee in it meaning in the day  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1276) until an appointed date is is no that's  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1279) also a place where people stumble they  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1281) appointed data they call  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1284) your death date is pretty determined and  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1287) then they go overboard and say it's very  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1289) determined in eternity before the  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1290) creation of the universe no it's not  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1291) true it may be vegetarian but it  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1293) delivered yesterday  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1295) but it is known that you have a fixed  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1297) day and it means the fixing may be  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1300) changing continuously for example  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1302) by Dua or by being good to your next of  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1305) kin  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1306) understand what the address I said who  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1307) overwhelms his agile to be extended  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1312) then he should be charitable to his next  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1315) of  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1315) kinase  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1318) so it can be and we have a Hadith for  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1321) example  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1323) some people are written to be dying this  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1326) year and they still after after Ramadan  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1329) they get married and some things they  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1330) have a long life of afford to them but  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1332) they are but maybe this one does a great  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1335) charitable there or make a good Dua or  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1337) somebody for him and then this what is  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1339) written in that Ramadan  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1341) wait we determined that's what I'm done  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1343) is just shifted it was it was written  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1345) that he will die for example like three  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1347) months later on on the other side of a  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1349) heart attack  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1350) and then certain things develop in  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1351) between then he said Allah will make it  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1353) shift and so but in the case the agent  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1355) is fix it the sixth moment the moment so  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1357) again Osama there's nothing being fixed  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1359) at the beginning of our universe no not  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1361) necessary  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1362) something may be effectively going to be  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1364) an invest like the end of this universe  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1365) Maybe  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1366) is already fixed I don't know but that's  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1369) for human beings is fixed from time to  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1371) time as it needs and may be extended  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1374) all the time Allah is know this one is  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1377) now if nothing develops in the future  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1379) counteracting that is that or if he  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1382) already have given news about someone  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1384) will die a certain day that is not a  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1386) certain way that's not Escape it's going  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1387) to happen like that like for example  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1391) uh let me give another interesting  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1392) example I've never thought it was  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1394) visiting his his Landing in what is NATO  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1397) Medina this is the positive and then he  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1399) was stuck with a certain disease  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1401) so badly he was in bed that his  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1404) companions and his friends he was  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1406) attending to some real estate that he  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1408) has really stayed there real estate in  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1409) franagan best places and they told him  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1412) just in a gentle way it seems we are  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1414) gone it's finished  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1416) foreign  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1425) because I'm not dying from this disease  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1427) the messenger Allah said I will die only  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1429) someone striking this let's fall ahead  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1431) so that this one his beard will be  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1435) will be will be drowned in Blood and  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1438) this is not this this was in his belly  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1440) it's not the one which will get blood  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1442) from my head down that's a man who will  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1444) be striking that told me he's one of the  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1446) most evil of this umber he will strike  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1448) you in head and the bleeding  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1460) so he was excited about that because  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1463) he's family but Muhammad he knows I mean  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1465) Allah is telling the truth and if he  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1468) said something in the future it's going  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1469) to happen  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1470) by Allah making it to happen not because  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1472) it's happening against the will of Allah  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1474) they are being determined at the  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1476) beginning when there's no that's all  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1478) that's all imagination of people of kada  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1480) jumping over the world no that's that's  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1483) an example  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1484) every moment is very very recalculated  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1487) and advanced it's in a dynamical way but  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1489) it's not Allah everyone should know if  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1492) nothing happens  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1494) a otherwise in the future they said like  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1496) if then else then that then it will be  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1500) that means it will be that day but  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1501) something may happen some development  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1503) some great Charities some great deed  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1505) happens some issues happen and that is  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1507) recalculated again and shifted that's  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1509) all in the power of Allah you have the  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1511) absolute dominance of the future he  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1512) makes the future  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1514) and what he has made  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1517) is that what will happen unless he  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1519) changed it unless he has committed  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1521) himself not to change because it's a  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1523) message to a message to a prophet or a  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1526) promise of of of a reward which he will  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1529) never forsake so again repeating that  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1532) again in that sense  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1537) um  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1543) and then he will inform you what you  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1546) have been doing all of that is on record  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1550) that's when death really comes that's it  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1552) don't come back to life until  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1555) then it says that for example the man  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1557) sorted who died for 100 Years A matter  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1560) they were dead it was dead and he  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1562) disintegrated  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1563) and his donkey disintegrated so it's  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1566) genuinely dead the usual dead although I  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1569) knew at that moment  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1571) that is not a final death  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1573) he will he decided he will rejected  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1575) about a hundred years Allah deliberately  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1578) did that to make America for the for  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1579) various reasons very complicated reason  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1581) which we don't know one of it is that  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1583) some story claimed this man was a  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1585) memorizer of the ancient books and most  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1587) ancient books were lost underwent by the  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1589) by the Rebellion when they invaded  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1591) Palestine and destroyed the temple so  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1594) this man  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1596) ought to survive for these hundred years  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1597) so that he can redictate from his memory  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1600) but he was noted  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1602) 100 years and when he woke up  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1606) one narration claimed that he was only  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1608) his head was awake I think this is  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1609) exaggerated but I don't know some not  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1612) well established narration and he was  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1613) looking at his restaurant but he's just  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1615) skeleton and he was shown how how bones  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1618) are covered anyway he was seeing it in  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1620) his donkey anyway the donkey with  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1621) divided he wants and he saw how the  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1623) bones are lifted up put together exactly  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1626) like they do in the museum and then  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1628) their belly are a very terrifying vision  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1630) and he saw that with his own eyes  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1633) not only one in history maybe you have  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1635) seen that  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1638) so that was not a financial login with  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1640) this notified that's not the final death  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1643) some life after they'll come and some  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1646) Deeds to be recorded and then he will  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1648) tell him what is  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1650) the hundred years will be a gap nothing  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1652) to be told you were you were you were  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1655) dead in that hundred years you didn't  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1656) when I think I was doing whatever  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1657) necessity you did nothing at the time  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1662) so this is all these amazing things but  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1664) if you look at this Division and the  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1666) meaning of Qatar probably then things  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1668) Enlighten your mind and you understand  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1671) the meaning of that he said who wants  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1673) his life to be extended then he should  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1675) be charitable to his next opinion and  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1677) the image of various other things to  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1678) extend lives  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1680) and other of his sins and so on would  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1682) show the life  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1684) that's none he knows that from from Ripe  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1687) from metaphysics and this means these  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1690) actions of Charity these kinds of Dua  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1692) they are capable of changing color and  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1696) the threes that had he says  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1698) are fighting between Heaven and Earth  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1700) forever  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1702) sometimes kada comes down in this case  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1705) inevitable for some reason Allah has  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1707) decided before or sometimes the Dua is  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1709) stronger and pushed Allah back but they  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1712) are fighting with Heavenly death  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1714) they give you obviously a visual picture  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1716) imaginary you are going up like a rocket  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1718) coming like a bump or like a stone and  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1721) they're fighting in between let's give  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1724) you a nice picture to imagine we know  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1725) it's not like that physically  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1727) well maybe it's like that physically we  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1729) don't know  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1731) but that's it  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1737) the drive of the oppressed even if he's  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1739) a catheter  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1740) Allah lifted up Say by my majesty and by  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1744) my exaltation I am going to respond to  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1746) you but into your course because the  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1749) spirit of the investors are not adapters  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1750) what now I will respond later maybe 50  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1753) years later maybe 30 years later but I  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1755) would respond  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1757) so that has to be you have to look at  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1759) that Dynamic and the other it will get  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1761) stuck into  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1762) the nonsensicality and making Allah  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1765) ultimately a dead  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1767) blind deaf nature which is not a Divine  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1770) being  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1771) which is impossible cannot exist  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1773) something can't exist really generally  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1775) can't exist so that's that's we have to  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1777) be very cautious about that people think  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1779) that they are somehow they are saving  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1781) our Perfection and comprehensive  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1782) knowledge  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1785) exactly a type of connection similar to  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1788) the conviction it is  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1791) so heavy that he himself got uplifted up  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1794) obviously contradictory because that's  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1796) an entity  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1797) can be referenced linguistically but  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1799) it's a null point or the pointer to  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1801) Absolute nothingness cannot be it's not  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1803) creatable it's not possible or Canal  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1805) create another device  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1806) all of these are nonsense nonsensical  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1809) questions  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1811) they look very nice linguistically but  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1813) they they're fair to nothing to absorb  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1815) the thing  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1817) next is  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1825) foreign  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1834) over his servants and he sends forth  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1837) Heavenly forces to watch over you until  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1840) when death approaches any of you our  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1842) messages our Messengers cause him to die  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1845) and they do not Overlook anyone next  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1848) translation he is the Supreme Master  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1850) over his worshipers he sends out  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1852) Heavenly forces to watch over you until  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1854) when death approaches you approaches any  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1857) of you those sent by us take his soul  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1860) they don't overlook anyone  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1863) yeah so  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1867) here is the hey there  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1870) is really the Supreme of the forceful  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1874) enforcer if you wish to say the one who  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1877) has absolute compelling Force that's  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1879) again because you're absolute dominance  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1880) above all his creation  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1888) but this has been withdrawn from the  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1891) from the decision of Iman and cover  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1893) because he gave the people the shows and  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1895) the account of that although he could  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1897) theoretically you could have enforced  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1899) that and he said if Allah wanted he  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1901) would make everyone available or even on  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1903) this video he did not want that the  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1905) decision made at the beginning of the  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1906) creation and Allah committed to himself  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1908) to that absolutely not going to change  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1912) in any other respect the universal  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1914) scheme he is the absolutely dominant  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1916) Force  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1917) above all his creation  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1920) and he sent guardians or sword receiver  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1926) and win the moment of death cups  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1928) which has  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1930) been which have been pretty distant  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1931) before cannot happen without Allah  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1933) permission I'll do a lot of fixing of it  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1935) that's the meaning  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1937) then our Messengers  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1939) will receive his soul and they don't  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1941) miss anyone they they will do the job  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1943) completely perfectly they will have a  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1945) complete assumption meaning the soul  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1947) with all what belongs to it information  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1950) database everything assuming the soul is  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1952) some kind of a program they will just  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1954) just to give a model of to make a sense  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1957) of the Soul it is not only copied the  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1960) program the program the program and the  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1962) database completely so it can be  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1964) reinstated  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1965) completely it's like having like a few  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1968) like if you have for example Windows you  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1969) have this programs who who make a  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1971) complete image of the windows so you can  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1974) format and so on and reinstate it again  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1976) and this is free of nothing has happened  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1980) that's something like that completely  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1982) effort and they don't they don't miss  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1984) anything they don't know they miss  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1985) anyone nobody escapes but also in  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1988) everyone nothing is being being forsaken  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1991) or left behind everything of relevance  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1993) which Define your identity yours  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1996) character your mind your history is  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=1998) there all your history all your  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2000) background all your ini files everything  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2004) is mistake  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2007) of a program with database and so on  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2010) complete nothing is missed so it can be  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2013) instated another computer completely  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2017) the miraculous nature of the the that  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2020) nature of this supreme program is that  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2022) it can be stated in actually no they  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2025) don't need to have similar Hardware you  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2026) can't have but this is even in computer  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2028) programming is possible now if it's  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2030) another Hardware you just need for  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2031) example like like a like a virtual  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2033) machine in between or something like  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2035) that then you can install this no  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2037) problem so even the hardware you just  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2039) have the virtual machine will  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2041) represented in the case of humans we  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2045) don't know if there's a need or  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2046) something like that but Allah says here  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2047) and he will create and something which  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2049) you don't know and another body is  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2051) another structure maybe in another  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2052) Universe altogether is capable of that  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2055) and that's what when when issues with  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2058) the atheists then we had you know simply  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2061) unable to comprehend they're because  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2063) they they missed the starting point that  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2065) he created the universal of the  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2066) beginning actually according to his uh  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2069) to his desire until he kind of decided  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2071) elsewhere and they can copy things from  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2073) here to the other one and so on that's  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2075) all accessible to his power it's all  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2077) contingent all possibilities  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2079) and the model of the program gives an  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2081) example  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2083) although we do it obviously with  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2085) intermediary like virtual machine and  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2086) things like that if necessary we may not  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2088) need that  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2092) for that  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2098) so everyone is received completely and  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2101) nobody escaped and everyone received in  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2103) for all his database all his information  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2105) all his soul and wishes  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2110) weaknesses and so on all of its article  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2112) that may be changed then and erased like  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2115) foreign for example the believer  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2118) when the enthal paradise many of them  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2121) have dry garages with others they have  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2123) conflicts you know you may what they  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2125) have a problem with your old brother  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2126) disputing about inheritance and then it  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2129) comes to a level that you despite being  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2131) both of your believer that become that  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2133) you hate each other  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2134) you have hatred to each other you have  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2137) even separated which is not obviously  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2138) the proper situation should be legally  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2140) but it could happen under motivated by  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2143) all these Dunya issues and so on until  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2145) they enter Paradise will be there any  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2148) God just know that garages will be  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2149) rearrated from their heart so the  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2151) program will be adjusted it's gone  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2162) so they will after everyone has been  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2164) received Allah  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2173) and they who have died are upon  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2176) are thereupon brought before God their  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2179) true Lord Supreme  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2181) overly his alone is all judgment and he  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2184) is a Swiss Swift swiftest of all  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2186) reckoners it's translation then they  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2189) will be bought before God their true  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2191) Lord judgment is truly his alone he is  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2194) the swiftest in taking accounts yeah no  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2196) so sensation is very clear so they will  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2198) be that after them these Messengers  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2201) whatever the messenger we don't know  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2202) these kind of angels what are they are  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2204) their programs are they conscious being  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2205) or half conscious or just mechanism we  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2208) don't know it's not good to speak a bit  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2210) about that it's completely wrong because  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2212) they're very serious about angels itself  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2214) some some of the self some of the sahaba  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2216) believe that angels are like like a  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2218) force says that like it's wind they're  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2221) not really conscious being so the humans  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2224) believe that this man is so nice like  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2226) the Angels they are mistaken they just  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2227) nicer known as they are created like  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2229) that they could not be otherwise so  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2231) you've got to embrace them for being  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2233) nice or not nice some of them are very  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2235) ugly like the guardian of the Hellfire  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2237) the version so the Gathering  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2239) Malik which is mentioned the name in  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2242) another data the Quran and the show saw  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2244) him representing the dream is going  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2248) around the will of fire and he said he  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2250) is the most ugly man you could ever  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2252) imagine  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2254) he represented him as extremely ugly  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2257) okay it's really be fitting to be a  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2259) guardian of the Hellfire he will not put  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2261) someone looking if you have seen some  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2263) pictures the Christians usually draw  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2265) angels with very nice faces and  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2267) beautiful ones  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2268) Etc  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2270) this would be as ugly as you the ugliest  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2273) man you could ever imagine  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2275) foreign  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2279) this is Malik  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2281) says alarm to him and say before he says  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2284) salaam to me he was ahead of me with  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2286) saying well this is also symbolic value  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2288) meaning Muhammad you are safe from  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2290) Hellfire and you want your nation are  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2292) essentially safe from Hell Fire I am  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2294) starting with the Salam you are safe  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2295) from me you don't need to start with  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2296) this I don't need you  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2299) I am the punishment I agree what from  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2303) the ugly one you have the Salah you are  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2305) safe  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2307) so  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2311) what we're standing yes so  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2314) we don't know what these these entities  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2316) but anyway whatever they receive it's a  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2318) present dollars foreign  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2352) foreign  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2425) so if you get it no it is not the most  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2429) polished the most nice one we will  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2430) polish it so he has but only the rule  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2434) English for him and this context clearly  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2435) the focus is  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2438) only one judge  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2441) and one King all these apparent Kings  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2445) and judges and Sony Dunya have  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2446) disappeared none have any decision or  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2449) anything to say  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2450) foreign  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2476) but most other really rulings and  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2479) judgments are formatted by the prophets  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2480) with their words  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2481) and then we have the scholars  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2484) formulating valuably but at the best of  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2487) it if they are sincere obviously at the  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2489) best they can that's also  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2491) but the essential and the call is coming  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2494) for Allah and they're trying to ruble it  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2496) as we said they can hopefully without  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2498) betrayal or Treasury  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2502) and he is the fastest welcome there are  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2504) many people who can do accounts but  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2506) nobody is faster and more accurate  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2508) obviously what is this is a matter of  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2509) the he has the stressor that the account  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2511) could be fast don't think Allah will get  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2514) stuck because you have such a long life  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2516) or because uh you have to account like  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2519) for example us now we are coming after  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2521) Adam most likely Adam is 250 000 years  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2524) before so many generations the accounts  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2526) that starts with Adam then generation  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2528) after generation to settle this course  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2530) all accounts not only relation to Allah  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2533) relation to humans and so on because  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2535) many other activities are the condition  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2537) and depending on the activities of our  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2539) fathers in the previous generation so  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2540) that has to be settled first and then we  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2543) have to reject how much we are  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2545) responsible for that how much we have  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2546) inherited and cannot do anything about  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2547) it that has been sorted out and taken  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2549) out all of that has to be done so it has  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2551) done so don't think because it takes  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2553) such a long time at the sort of 50 000  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2556) years or something like that that Allah  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2559) is not far quicker he's in the corner he  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2561) will get through that don't worry and  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2562) the fastest possible way without  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2564) coordinating the principle of stick and  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2567) meticulous accounting so that no no even  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2569) atom weight or a mustard weight can be  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2572) forsaken still he's the fastest nobody  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2575) can be faster than him but the fastness  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2577) does not negate that it has to be the  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2579) meticulously missing nothing or who  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2581) assault has to be  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2584) um  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2589) [Music]

[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2631) when you humbly and secretly call upon  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2633) him and say if he will save us from this  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2635) distress we will be among the grateful  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2638) I just need to look at yourself for this  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2640) I'm saying the second Calamity what you

[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2646) that but the forget will come later  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2648) about it  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2649) so when  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2651) who is the one who really saved and you  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2653) respond to these these calls especially  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2655) in dire needs especially with calling  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2657) extremely dire needs in the darkness of  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2659) the of the land when you are lost in the  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2661) desert or in the action of the sea  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2663) because the sea is is definitely not the  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2665) place three months you usually live they  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2668) are on ship they are at best on ship or  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2671) a raft  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2672) and in Elements which is another  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2674) elements because they land animals land  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2676) creatures and they're just in a hostile  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2678) environment and if it is then thundering  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2680) and stormy and the waves are like  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2682) mountains then you'll have a surface do  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2684) you think it's finished that's going  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2685) away it's gone I'm gone on the in this  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2688) situation everyone even an atheist one  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2691) God if you exist help me or even forget  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2694) about that he denies oh God help me oh  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2696) God help me  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2697) or for example in accident sometimes we  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2700) have records of accidents like like a  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2702) plane falling and so on and we have  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2704) inter somebody called the answer  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2706) and then you see the people screaming  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2707) got calling for help from Allah we have  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2710) to serve that we have a thing a recent  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2712) record  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2714) when uh when this this mental guy in  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2717) Germany uh crashed up in the laboratory  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2720) coming back from this one to Germany and  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2722) the way through there he made a test but  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2724) nobody noticed it was seen later in the  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2726) record in the so-called black box so she  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2728) had a yellow box but the black box and  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2730) then in the way back  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2733) how it works  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2735) and then when he decided to do that he  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2738) locks the door while taking an  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2740) opportunity where the captain was going  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2742) for the rule or something lock the door  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2744) and then  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2745) when Derek says mountain and the people  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2747) saw that the plane is going down and  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2749) there was creaming some of the screaming  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2751) is recorded they don't give us a record  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2752) but most seriously oh God oh God most  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2754) likely no doubt about that and the pilot  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2757) and the uh and the steward Steward and  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2759) see what this is where hammering with  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2761) the door open for God's sake Robin  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2763) until it crashed that's all record  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2766) Ed him inside he don't say anything  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2768) element height looking this in the eye  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2772) so the people are most likely screaming  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2773) they don't tell us what they're  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2774) screaming  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2775) I am 100 sure if it is it must be on  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2779) record it must be said oh God oh God  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2781) that's that's all what I was claiming if  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2783) it is on record if it is penetrated but  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2786) most likely penetrated to the recording  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2788) device and some of it but definitely the  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2790) the pilot is saying uh the captain  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2793) himself is saying for God's sake Auburn  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2796) oh God for that sake of  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2799) God  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2805) someone who says at first sometimes  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2808) even in even Hinduism they were called  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2811) bhagwan they don't call the specific  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2813) deity  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2814) just Channel  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2815) Christians sometimes they call Jesus but  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2817) because Jesus from his God or some kind  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2819) of a personality of God so it's got just  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2822) one and in fact has got just giving you  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2824) another name so the only one is called  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2827) this one not any deity which people  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2829) believe it's communities about it  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2830) they're called the Supreme one that's  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2832) the Supreme one and they look to the  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2834) heaven and things like that  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2837) and usually they will say if you say  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2839) from us we'll be very thankful  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2841) we'll appreciate that I'll just just  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2843) save us from that it will be very  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2845) thankful we'll express our thank you in  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2847) various ways do they fulfill that no  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2850) Jacob  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2853) um  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2859) God Alone can save you from this and  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2862) from every distress and still you  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2864) describe Divinity to other powers beside  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2867) him next translation say God Alone can  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2870) save you from this and from every  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2872) distress and still you attribute  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2873) Divinity to Divinity to others beside  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2876) him the Calamity and the distress is  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2878) over especially at Sea when they Outland  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2881) they say you know now we're in safety  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2883) and the qurana does that in other places  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2885) but are you sure that you are at London  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2888) safety maybe I can send you a wind with  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2890) stones flying around this is like a  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2893) hurricane which would destroy you also  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2894) at London that you are safe at land  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2897) think about that and then they go to  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2900) their shirt there's not a city that they  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2902) go to another just they maybe then they  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2905) just submit to other Masters they  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2906) attributed the right realization to  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2908) themselves oh No actually that's it we  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2911) have the lie too so they defined for  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2913) ourselves what's good and even the silk  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2915) awesome  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2918) it says we have the right to have uh to  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2920) begin we have the right to do without  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2923) any there is a sensible cause to change  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2926) gender all of these things change the  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2928) creation of Allah with no sense of a  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2929) reason there's some sense of reasons  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2930) which is  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2933) so we are free we are on ourselves our  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2937) our bodies Our Own ownership  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2940) we reject about our own advantages  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2945) they say oh now we've called for Shiva  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2948) or we call for no no that's the most  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2951) this time is happy like that now this  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2953) this is gone this is all right  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2955) well they're actually just lit okay  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2958) usually Banking and then the interest no  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2960) it makes sense who said that that  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2963) usually is bad user is good it says that  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2965) is the rental of the money for God's  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2967) sake or you come with the world with  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2969) your ideology is the claim coming from  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2970) over seven heavens we have judged that  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2973) it talks are good the user is like like  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2975) what's the difference between selling on  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2977) bike or renting a house we didn't think  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2979) about anything money we have to pay a  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2980) rent that's it  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2984) minded way then people say that when  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2986) they come to the land they start then  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2988) calling uh  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2990) other deities and so on no no mostly it  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2993) will be this type of shirk we are the  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2995) master of a destiny we are the Lords of  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2997) the of our  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=2999) Behavior we enact close as we wish we do  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3003) whatever we want we are the Masters we  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3006) don't listen to these Professor listen  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3007) to Revelation that's all all that that's  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3010) that maybe have been maybe that oh yeah  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3012) this is for early generation people were  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3015) very backward and simple-minded and they  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3017) needed these house regulations now we  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3019) have advanced we have drugs and  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3021) technology advanced insurance we  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3022) understand how the universe works that's  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3024) going to comply with that or you would  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3026) have to do a new registration that is  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3027) just enough acceptable with all kinds of  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3029) arguments is the shark is being  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3031) propagated just listen around see what  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3033) the second  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3034) is exactly that  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3036) exactly that on this most of it for the  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3039) for the for the Arabs that's also a  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3041) considerable part of it some people  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3043) think it says the woman they escaped and  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3045) land for example after the sea because  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3047) the sea is the most terrifying one  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3048) situation I see with storms and so on  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3051) which looks like last finish deadly or  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3053) gone there's no way you can escape then  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3054) you escape by plant  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3056) the develops had other deities and so on  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3059) they may start calling them and so on in  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3061) there that is just to appease these  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3064) deities most likely because the Adidas  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3065) are their sons and the offsprings of God  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3067) and God will be pleased for calling them  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3069) that's what their argument and so on so  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3071) but their main shark is really that we  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3074) register for ourselves  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3076) that's it  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3078) we need to fix things according to our  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3081) needs and our desires not according with  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3083) Allah commands  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3084) came to give by our finally the only  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3087) questions said listen we travel in  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3090) business for long times and we cannot we  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3092) cannot avoid going through prostitutes  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3094) give us something say there's no way I  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3096) can allow people yes they want they want  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3100) to have their prostitution trouble  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3101) because we travel and we stay very long  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3104) far away  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3106) no that's not that way we are not  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3108) allowed to approach issue if you're  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3110) staying long away then take one one will  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3114) arrive by costing Lots or all your  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3115) rights with you or don't have it  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3118) probably just got shot adjust your life  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3120) to the Divine commands not the Divine  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3121) commands according to your liking that's  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3123) helpful question  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3124) but they want it I know that and so on  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3127) and they kept negot to say about you as  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3128) they say we heard that you pull  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3129) everything is forget about that and so  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3133) on  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3134) so don't think they were worried and  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3137) even about  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3139) so it has to be demolished they were not  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3142) demolishing about ourselves say okay I  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3144) can't accommodate for that feeling now  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3145) you're still connected with this Idol I  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3148) will send someone else to demolition but  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3150) it will be the best  
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3151) foreign  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3158) for them those who escaped them from the  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3161) Calamity and they think they are they're  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3162) now safe no  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3164) so  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3169) um  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3181) say it is he alone who has the power to  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3184) let loose upon you suffering from above  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3186) you or from beneath your feet or to  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3188) confound you with mutual Discord and let  
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3190) you taste the fear of one another  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3193) behold how many facets we give to these  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3196) messages so that they might understand  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3198) the truth this translation say it is he  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3201) alone who has the power to afflict you  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3203) with suffering from above or from  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3205) beneath your feet or to divide you to or  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3208) to divide you into design divisive  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3210) factions and let you taste the fear of  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3213) one another  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3214) see how we explain these messages so  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3216) that they might understand yeah so  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3218) there's there's a narration that talks  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3220) on here in media that received this eye  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3222) already there say I say  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3225) but they can't send the punishment from  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3227) above you that means something like like  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3229) lightning strike like like parts of the  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3232) heaven like comets or of materialize  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3234) falling on you there's nothing coming  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3235) that this is smashing absolutely  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3237) smashing I would watch it I take a  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3240) future Allah from this all from position  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3242) from below your feet by the earth going  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3244) subduction that's the worst thing could  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3247) happen to anyone suddenly the Earth is  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3249) giving away and you're falling in it in  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3251) a will or something like that that's  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3253) nothing can be done that this is  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3255) absolutely  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3256) and then the third one  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3258) that he he divide you in in groups and  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3262) which are fighting each other and we're  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3264) treating each other harshly and so on so  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3266) we suffer on each other hands and we say  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3268) Allah said by obviously Bye Bye Bye by  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3271) Allah's design by Allah protecting him  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3273) from he did not against that because it  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3275) this will will happen until there's no  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3278) way to avoid that that's the type of  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3280) punishment which is  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3282) nowhere to avoid that  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3284) even for believers sometimes  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3286) and they said this is easier  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3289) he did not say all the way chica if he  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3292) ever said he may his right may have been  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3293) accepted but Allah prevented him to make  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3296) that dwell by saying this is easier that  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3299) being split in groups and so on was  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3301) likely  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3303) I would say it is by Allah's instigation  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3305) that he did not make Dua for this  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3306) because Allah would say no actually  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3309) another occasion concerning myself he  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3312) asked that they should not be suffering  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3314) this and I'll say there's no way to to  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3316) fulfill that  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3317) because if they start if the the if if  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3322) they start doing that and it will happen  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3324) or evidently because people with dispute  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3326) that happens because of transgression  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3328) because people forsaking some of the  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3330) scripture  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3331) and leave it at another I think I  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3334) remember you passed that I have said uh  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3336) was that we took Covenant from the  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3337) people of uh those who said we are  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3340) Christian  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3341) and they forgot or they forsaken some of  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3343) that what we have instructed to them and  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3346) the result of that I think we helped us  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3349) anyway if you have not first welcome in  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3351) the future but let's mention it now  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3353) because of that if you forsake some of  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3355) that what Allah giving it as  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3356) instructions  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3369) left behind and forsaken  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3373) is essential  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3376) it's not just the etiquettes and so on  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3377) is essential and it's completely lost  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3379) it's not anywhere there to be find in  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3381) the description with the result that it  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3384) will be dispute between them over and  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3386) hatred and factionalize factualization  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3389) until the end of time it's not going to  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3391) end because it's nowhere to recover  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3396) recovery by going back in the Quran and  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3398) going security soon again like  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3400) alhamdulillah we hopefully shall doing  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3402) at the moment  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3403) that's the way to go  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3405) so it can't be corrected but there it is  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3407) incorrectable and the result is is a  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3409) dispute and hatred by necessity the same  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3412) would happen with the ummah if they  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3414) forsake some of the scripture some of  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3416) that they give you the Quran neglect  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3417) some of the Quran that actually take  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3419) some of it which fits their desire on  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3421) board then they will be between them  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3423) enmity and head because other other  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3424) group will see you have forsaken that  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3426) you are real you are covered and they  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3429) start having dispute and fight between  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3430) them until they come to the fundamental  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3433) common tab is that take all the Quran  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3436) on board and all the verified and  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3439) discultization that's the only way  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3441) starting with the whole and fast we do  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3443) that then there will be no reason for  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3445) any fundamental and deadly disputes I'll  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3448) be small disagreements that is not  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3449) totally it's not parties and probably  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3452) differences they had which people would  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3454) understand it's never understood is not  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3456) a problem but will be nothing  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3457) fundamental which leads to Warfare and  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3459) confrontation  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3462) so that's that's exactly what really  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3464) will happen for for this ummah but if  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3466) it's um a collection is available  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3467) because the liquor is protected  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3469) for the children question it would it  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3471) will never happen because their headache  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3474) is not protected and they are supposed  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3475) to disappear and join the final  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3477) messenger they didn't join so they are  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3478) stuck in there in their ways and there's  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3480) no way unless they join become Muslim  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3482) there's no way they can't get out of  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3484) this factionalization and hate it  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3489) so Allah tell them don't they think that  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3491) if you have escaped because I say that  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3494) after they have been saved they are  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3496) unthankful  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3498) but don't don't be complacent don't  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3500) think that he is not capable of  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3501) punishing or even at any other situation  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3503) like bring you some some kind of a of a  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3507) punishment or or  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3510) a Calamity from above you from heaven  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3514) or from below your feet  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3517) or the head one is instigate hatred and  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3520) conflicts between each other so that you  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3523) taste each other  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3525) evil action and so on  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3527) so see how many eyes and went away we  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3530) present them the reality of the universe  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3532) that they may become understanding that  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3534) they may have deep understanding of  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3536) death cone so that may be they deeply  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3538) understand because it's a  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3539) straightforward selfish understanding is  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3541) not enough you have to go deeper in that  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3543) you have to have a deeper understanding  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3546) connecting things together and connected  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3548) to its rules and to General General  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3549) principle to the actual cases that's  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3551) fact  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3552) so they may have something  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3556) we will give them various facets of the  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3558) complex reality so that they may have  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3564) okay  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3567) in  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3570) most  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3576) and yet to all this thy peoples have  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3579) given the light although it is the truth  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3581) say then I am not responsible for your  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3584) conduct next translation  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3586) yet your people feel rejected even  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3588) though it is the truth say I am not your  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3591) keeper  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3592) actually the the Ayah here is that the  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3595) next eye is part of this  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3597) okay let's have this part the meaning is  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3599) clear but with despite of all this  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3601) explanation the system was very deep  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3603) let's actually show Divine knowledge and  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3605) some of it is relatively simple  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3607) not that deep it's not it's not that  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3609) shadow but it's not that deep like the  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3611) issues of punishment and saving God who  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3613) saves in the darkness of the of the land  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3616) of the sea Etc and who is capable of  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3618) visiting you with other calamities in  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3621) the future don't think they have escaped  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3622) and he's not have no control on you and  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3624) he has only control at sea or  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3626) controlling the darkness of the land he  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3628) has controlled everywhere at each time  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3634) they have declared that to be Ally and  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3637) they have rejected it  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3638) although it's the truth nothing can be  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3641) said after after you have explained the  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3642) truth about all the evidences and give  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3644) examples that elaborated things I just I  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3647) am not called yet I am not your key but

[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3652) representative telling you what's what  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3653) he has revealed to me I have no power  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3655) over here  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3658) you could be okay for someone  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3660) that's meaning representative  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3665) I have no dominance for you Allah  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3669) and then the next I wish I read already  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3671) in  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3677) a house reading here  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3680) okay every Tiding from God has a term  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3682) set for its fulfillment fulfillment and  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3686) in time you will come to know the truth  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3687) next translation every news from God has  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3691) a fixed time to be fulfilled and in time  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3693) you will come to realize the truth  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3695) and this is just a hello hinting that  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3698) this this truth will prevail and thus  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3701) the the mechan will be ultimately  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3702) defeated because that already already  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3704) announced by Allah in Mount  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3708) and also in the bishop to Ibrahim that  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3711) this Friday or this Messenger will be  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3714) the one who will be dominant and also in  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3715) in Isaiah in the book of Isaiah there's  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3719) hint that he will come and conquer the  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3721) city with ten thousand of the holy men  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3723) Etc thus hinting to the conquest of  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3725) Mecca most likely because no one in  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3728) history ever conquered his enemies with  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3730) ten thousand men and and established  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3733) himself that's very clear  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3737) with the holy man that's also an Isaiah  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3739) others already announced that it must be  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3741) fulfilled but it will take its time and  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3743) to to and when it comes you will see it  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3745) until not and most of that you see we're  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3747) still alive some of them perished  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3749) obviously has Catherines  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3755) Etc but the rest have survived and saw  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3758) the defeat the defeated in battle they  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3761) saw the partial victory in Ohio they saw  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3764) their attempt to get to to succeed in in  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3767) the siege of Madina and  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3769) that they saw their final defeat in in  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3772) the conquest of Mecca so they they came  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3775) to know that's all it has been preferred  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3777) it's already that's it Mecca telling me  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3779) you would know and they knew we know  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3781) from history  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3785) another important instruction about what  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3787) how to deal with people who are mocking  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3790) and and  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3791) not discussing or  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3793) indulging in a proper dialogue but in  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3796) just a smokery and then playing games  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3798) and uh with the Revelation and so on how  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3801) to behave with them that's a very  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3802) important Ayah whether it is  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3809) foreign  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3815) now whenever thou meets such as such as  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3819) indulging Blasphemous talk about our  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3821) messages  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3822) turn thy back upon them until they begin  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3824) to talk about other things and if Satan  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3826) should ever call thee to forget thyself  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3828) remain not after recollection in the  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3832) company of such evil doing folk sure  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3834) yeah and the translation yeah  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3838) whenever you encounter those who speak  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3840) with disrespect about our Revelations  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3842) turn away from them until they moved on  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3845) to another topic and if Satan should  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3847) ever cause you to forget them  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3850) do not remain with those unjust people  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3852) after realizing what they are doing yeah  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3855) so that's that's that's a that's what  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3857) some some maybe some some so-called  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3860) salafi invokers and so on but it's it's  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3863) counter to them what is there you say is  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3865) that if you see those who are waiting  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3867) they say hold is like waiting in the  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3868) water it's not it's not uh if if you  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3872) feel like like like water you can walk  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3875) in a tourism and you can't be just  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3876) waiting by moving your foot right and  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3878) let's just play playful this just  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3880) messing with the eyes mocking them  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3882) playing with them instead of discussing  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3884) that for example we discussed it it  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3887) means this it doesn't mean this if you  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3888) are discussing and say we don't believe  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3890) this point exfoliant to us okay we are  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3893) this way but there's a this is the joke  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3895) you must be joking gear and so on that's  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3897) how that's not a debate that's not a  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3899) discussion which leads to any Etc that's  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3901) just a mockery at making it like making  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3904) a joke if it made the joke it's a hard  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3906) it is just waiting around playing around  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3908) with the usually disrespect and or  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3912) making jokes and things like that  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3914) in our revelation  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3916) then turn away from them and if you are  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3918) sitting with them stand up and go  
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3921) but if they stop that and then start  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3924) doing wedding in another something is  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3925) kept our ayat maybe you're talking about  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3927) Dunya talking about a woman talking  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3929) whatever thing which is not our is  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3932) okay to go back and sit with them that's  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3934) the point  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3935) only if they are waiting and mockering  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3937) and so on and this is clarified further  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3939) in Medina and Madina it says  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3943) it says to someone Afghanistan or I have  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3947) revealed already to the book that if you  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3948) see the eyes of Allah being mocked and  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3950) being had that's clarified there more  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3952) foreign  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3961) so that's that's injunction but my  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3963) friend we're not doing that they were  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3964) sitting with this one making say oh  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3966) there's just a theory we're just  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3967) attending like like a like an amusement  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3969) session it's a comedy just to relax and  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3972) is on our chest the burden of Life yeah  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3975) you can easily Reserve by making more  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3977) career about yourself maybe or even  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3979) about your parents which is bad but not  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3981) about our last Revelation that's of  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3983) limit Allah and his messenger are off  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3985) limit to be subject of mockery and jokes  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3988) and comedy that's it that's out you can  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3991) make more connect with everything else  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3992) go ahead it may be bad maybe not not a  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3996) proper etiquette making more care about  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=3998) your parents and so on but it's not that  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4000) what what is absolutely prohibit and  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4002) leading to government  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4003) under the Medina says if if you if you  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4007) do that then Allah will get the money  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4009) and the caffeine together in the  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4010) Hellfire so because the one who sit  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4012) there and continue is a monopoly cannot  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4014) a man should dictate that at least when  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4016) Allah's Revelation and Allah the  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4018) messenger name is mocked and made a  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4020) subject of jokes and so on  
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4023) that you stand abundant that's all you  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4026) don't kill them you don't want anything  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4027) with them people think that you have to  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4028) kill them no no stand up and lips this  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4031) is not this is not a a joking or a comic  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4035) session you just read oh they start  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4036) talking and they think as you can join  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4038) back  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4040) so you see clearly that it is not an  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4043) authority for the salary you don't  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4045) certainly help with that and discuss  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4046) with them or even have a debate with  
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4047) them that has nothing to do with that  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4049) that's that's the way they try to invest  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4052) the Aya in there in there if there's if  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4054) some of them try to make some sense of  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4055) their behavior don't say to them  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4057) otherwise maybe his argument may be  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4060) entered in your heart and so on meaning  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4062) that you your argument is 40. you have  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4064) some problem you have to go back in the  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4065) drawing board and study what we are  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4066) doing and analyze it and maybe he's  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4069) telling the truth we have to analyze it  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4071) that's the way debate the way it goes  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4073) maybe he's truthful maybe I'm truthful  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4075) then we have to analyze it  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4077) yeah you see the point so that's that's  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4079) what the scientific name and so on has  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4080) nothing to do with this Ayah the is that  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4082) only for those who are waiting and  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4084) making mockery and making like a like a  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4087) like a session of comedy and enjoyment  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4091) that's of limit anything else no problem

[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4100) problem if it happens that you have  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4102) forgotten that you are sitting there and  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4104) you do not know that you did not  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4105) remember the injection the moment you  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4106) remember because the devil may be able  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4108) to make you forget that there's an  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4110) injection like that the moment you  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4111) remember  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4112) then use to continue you see sitting and  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4114) you stand up or up and go  
[1:08:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4117) now it is off it's standing out into  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4120) into a comic session into a comedy  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4123) that's not a comedy Masala bye and you  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4125) go  
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4126) so if if you happen to forget on the  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4130) messenger could forget but also everyone  
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4131) else can forget so that this thing  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4132) through the messenger meaning it's good  
[1:08:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4134) you could forget this this issue because  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4137) this is uh some people say the message  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4139) is unfaliable in reporting from what I  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4142) cannot forget what supporting them Allah  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4143) but it's not about Allah this is just in  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4145) Lively introduction he could forget that  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4147) that he uh very easy that that he uh was  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4152) supposed to go to the market and buy  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4154) something can't happen to him  
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4155) Allah has nothing more reporting a  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4158) revelation that's just live introduction  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4160) and life interaction you can't forget  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4162) things yeah he can forget his keys at  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4164) home the time they didn't have key but I

[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4168) sometimes you forget keys on the outside  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4170) of the door which is rare but it's very  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4173) dangerous it happened to me where this  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4174) once in my life or twice  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4176) yeah  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4177) can't happen what can happen Euros  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4179) that's all possible  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4180) but if it happens you remember ah  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4184) stand up and walk away  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4187) I'll call my body mean  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4194) um

[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4206) from whom those who are comfortable from  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4210) whom those who are conscious of God are  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4211) in no wise accountable theirs however is  
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4215) a duty to admonish the Sinners but that  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4217) they might become conscious of God  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4219) next translation those who are mindful  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4221) of God are not accountable for the  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4223) wrongdoers however this is a reminder to  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4226) them so that they may become mindful of  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4228) God this this gives the heck of the The  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4231) Reason Not the the purpose of this  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4234) injunction the purpose is that it's not  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4237) that you are responsible for what people  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4238) are saying and doing no that's not the  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4240) purpose because certainly unders so you  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4244) could say I'm not a problem for them all  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4245) Koreans  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4246) yes but you making a stand at least it  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4251) gets through that level of mukhari  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4252) making a stand  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4255) by leaving the place that this the eye  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4258) of Allah Allah himself and his  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4260) Messengers are not subject of jokes and  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4262) so on and and mokary Etc and cannot be  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4265) subject of like movies which which are  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4268) comic of comic type and the demeaning  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4271) type or inserting type no never ever  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4275) if you stand up and leave or not attend  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4278) the movie and go to movie theater or  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4279) object to it or cut it from whatever  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4282) tools you can have in the case of movies  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4284) things like that  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4285) it is to remind the others  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4288) that they may hopefully by this they  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4290) would go ah this man is leaving I'm not  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4293) not participating in our joke and maybe  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4295) they are joking they are just  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4296) simple-minded they are idiots and many  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4298) of these disabilities are just idiotic  
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4300) they have they cannot make a distinction  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4302) between God and His messenger and other  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4303) things and they don't know how to  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4306) understand it's just a joke  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4307) some people here this is silly things  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4310) like that that's so simple-minded they  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4312) have they have not been brought up to  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4314) regard that God that his Messengers on  
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4316) this is Holy and this have a certain  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4318) sanctity because of the upbringing code  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4321) of the social situation the social  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4322) pressure back in the west now you see  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4325) for example you don't see except that  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4327) some devoted Christian object into some  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4329) movies which depicted his and his  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4331) decibels as gay or for example  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4334) historical security whatever or making  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4337) making jokes about him or representing  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4340) them informal informal of of cartoons I  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4343) think uh the regardless  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4345) it's okay  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4347) maybe it's not the best but it's okay  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4349) that's not there's no barrier that  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4352) there's something holy which should not  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4354) be matter of  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4356) Makari or jokes of limit to that  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4360) absolute of limit they don't but if you  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4362) do that then there was elect for example  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4365) Muslim participated with people who  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4367) demonstrated against these these uh I  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4369) think in the 90s there was a there was I  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4371) think that there was it the operator or  
[1:12:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4373) something like that and was a nasty  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4375) representation and Muslim supported the  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4378) Christian and their demonstration they  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4379) don't sit in front of the theater that's  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4382) enough to show them that they are  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4384) objecting that maybe this will most  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4386) about that's an issue who should not be  
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4389) this thing should not be a matter of all  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4391) but there are so many other issues you  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4393) could have an operators  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4396) some some bounty hunters or Star Wars or  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4400) something like that but not about godan  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4402) is missing or Elisa or his mother  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4405) doesn't work this way it may remind some  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4407) people it may that they may become then  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4409) God conscious  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4410) so that's that's you should do that not  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4413) only because it's of limited is not  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4416) supposed to comply with the command  
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4417) whatever but keep in mind that it will  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4419) combine with the command it may have  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4421) this positive result it has this good  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4423) effect  
[1:13:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4425) and they continue because this was  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4427) obviously a very very Valentine collage  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4429) that they said that have a mockery  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4430) sessions and joking and so on  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4432) and then another instructions

[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4567) of boiling water and painful punishment  
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4570) awaits them because of their persistence  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4572) in denying the truth just just the the  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4575) word used here actually uh you know what  
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4577) you said and Topsail enough this is the  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4581) the the Ruth basala is used in the Quran  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4586) only in this place twice  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4589) basal is the word from that to have a  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4591) name which is a personal name of many  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4593) people even the oldest son of half of  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4595) that asset the older than Bashar is a  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4597) bastard no one who was killed in his  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4599) life so the one who was prepared to be  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4601) his follower really basil  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4604) Basel Michelle says this man has basada  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4606) has has courage and so on actually it's  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4609) not I mean the original I mean  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4612) is  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4614) the one who reads so that it's a it's  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4618) connected to the courage is the  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4619) secondary meaning but someone who reads  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4621) the Raider so one that a soul may be  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4625) raided and if you are raided you are  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4627) obviously captured and healthy hostage  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4629) or or have sold in slavery so be careful  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4633) that no a soul will not be raided  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4637) because uh because of this uh making  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4641) their religion just about a past time  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4643) and then a game and an amusement and  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4646) taking their religion and relation to  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4648) Allah and the meaning because religion  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4649) is the way of life taking it as a matter  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4651) of joke and mockery meaning they have  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4654) they have no respect for them religion  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4655) is just a matter of enjoyment and  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4658) locally they can make jokes about it  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4659) they it has no no sanctity and not  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4662) important fundamental value they have no  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4664) connection to the reality of the  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4666) universe because religion is the way of  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4668) life which connects you to the origin of  
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4670) the Universalist meaning if that's for  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4673) this fundamental issue it's just a  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4674) Pastime and mockery that you are really  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4677) in big trouble then you would be irated  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4679) so that's what you have did you'll be  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4682) raided and you'll be taken hostage  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4685) as obscilla and and those who will be  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4690) will be taken hostage or make  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4693) accountable in extreme form of being  
[1:18:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4695) created  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4696) they will have no  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4698) Guardian beside Allah not protector they  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4701) will have known when it is healing for  
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4703) them and they have whatever  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4705) uh runs from their their willing to pay  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4709) and consider that will not be accepted  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4711) they don't have any victory over anyway  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4713) but even if it's if even if even if you  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4717) have all possibility of a full of the  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4718) Earth with gold and silver to pay as a  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4720) ransom this will not be accepted there  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4722) would be you wouldn't have but even if  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4724) you have it it looks like server it will  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4726) not take him for it  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4727) those are the ones who are berated and  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4730) taken hostage and have sold in slavery  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4732) for that what they have done they will  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4734) have done obvious sold into all the  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4736) slavery it will be enslaved at the  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4737) Hellfire they will have boiling hot  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4739) water and severe punishment so that's  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4741) what they have been rejecting the truth  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4743) persistently  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4747) the next one is Cecilia I knew a new  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4749) context so maybe we'll stop here yeah  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4752) and that will be I I think 71 yeah  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4755) in my account it is indeed 71 yes yeah  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4759) yeah there's three example this is about  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4761) one  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4762) yeah this is about more than one hour  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4764) one hour fifty that's good so we can  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4767) have some like one hour or less 45  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4770) minutes for questions so we can catch up  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4772) so what I'll do is I've got a question  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4774) related to what we've got and then I've  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4776) got a whole kick off with these  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4777) questions and uh anyone more than  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4780) welcome okay here's one sorry first  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4782) things first so on the issue of People  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4784) mocking uh Islam in the prophet so in  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4788) terms of the Africa about  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4791) um you know commonly understood somebody  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4793) who mocks to to to the death penalty to  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4796) be applied to them can you give us some  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4798) explanation about that in terms of in  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4800) relation to so for example people use  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4802) the example of caliber of mocking and  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4805) then him being executed  
[1:20:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4807) no this is  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4809) the issue the Ayah is clearly saying  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4811) that you just leave  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4813) and you just object to that's it that's  
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4815) clear that's in Mecca now in Medina  
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4817) there's not a lot of mocking myself is  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4820) is actually he did not want the prophet  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4823) personally directly what he did  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4826) when Croatia was defeated in Badr  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4828) he went to Mecca and persuading their  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4832) lamentation and excited and they can get  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4834) close to wage war against pandasa so his  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4836) exciting War action and in Medina he  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4839) started doing tashvi with the woman like  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4841) this woman is having a big booty this  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4845) woman is having such a nice bum this  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4847) morning thus like abusing them that I am  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4850) aware about your woman Beauty and your  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4852) appears and things like that  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4855) and this is very for the all of this  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4857) video very demeaning a very abusive  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4859) direct instructable profit as far as I  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4862) know he did not  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4865) so let's face it that's number one so  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4867) the whole thing is invite the collage to  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4870) wage war he became a warrior  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4871) and that's what his wife said in that if  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4874) you should go to sahiba the translation  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4875) of the Hadith how he was assassinated  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4877) which led the assassination that is that  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4880) when when uh sahabi who came to to  
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4883) negotiate with him uh for a loan and  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4886) things like that  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4887) his wife told him  
[1:21:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4889) how can you go to them you are a man at  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4891) War and  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4893) you are a state of War how can you go  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4895) say no this is my my milk brother and so  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4898) on even if I'm sleeping he will do  
[1:21:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4900) nothing to me that's his conception he  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4902) thought the the he'll be treated by his  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4905) milk brother the same way people used in  
[1:21:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4907) the area they will put a relation of  
[1:21:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4909) milk Brotherhood and genealogy above any  
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4912) other consideration  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4913) I did not comprehend that Islam came to  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4916) make that above consider ultimate  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4917) consideration is Islam Allah  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4919) his messenger and all other  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4921) considerations are under that or even  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4924) broken if it's contradicts to that so he  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4926) went out to his demise  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4928) so he that's what he's doing his Waging  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4930) War  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4933) that's all what that's that's so the  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4935) argument that is not correct the other  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4936) argument is that there's a obscure story  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4938) about a blind man who uh his wife was  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4941) insulting the prophet and so on his  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4943) Jewish he's a Jewish wife and he's a  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4945) Muslim and it was insulting the prophet  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4948) etc etc for uh considerable time and  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4952) then ultimately he lost patience and he  
[1:22:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4953) killed her  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4956) it seems to be the story I said is  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4958) obscure because it seems to be who after  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4960) he killed there he was got terrified or  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4962) had some help because he's blind now he  
[1:22:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4964) tell you someone gave him some help and  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4967) he got rid of the body by dumping maybe  
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4969) outside or something and then obviously  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4972) the investigation as a dead woman who  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4974) killed it  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4975) and then they was investigating and so  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4977) on discussing that publicly in the  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4978) machines because I must see the place  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4979) for even everything caught on or  
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4981) preparing war and so on but it's a small  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4983) community of a few thousand clear the  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4985) message also like the main Court  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4988) and then there was someone accusing this  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4991) someone is thinking about this someone  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4992) that we know that she has a hostility  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4994) with this or this and then allegedly the  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4997) man came forward stumbling as a blind  
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=4999) man and say I am the one who killed her  
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5001) and because of this and this and this  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5003) and the legend of the result says  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5010) about each other about here so her blood  
[1:23:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5013) is she's with your bloodshed  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5016) so this man was not held account for  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5019) this act but did he order that the the  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5022) people who make her moral would be  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5024) killed no uh so it is so there's a  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5027) allegedly acceler narrative the story is  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5030) having some questionable point there  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5032) yeah  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5033) I have to analyze it further but this is  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5036) this is the usually one invoke that's  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5038) all what we have  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5040) what we have uh here is clear and also  
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5043) in Madina which says that previously at  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5045) the eye of Allah  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5047) then don't sit with them because Allah  
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5052) not killed by the prophet so this and  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5055) this is the the that's the really that  
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5058) issue there is again issue of and is  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5063) that's it in the case of someone I think  
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5067) that's what the people have been excited  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5068) recently uh  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5070) what his action is actually was more or  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5073) less instigating war against Muslim  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5075) because it says his amount of obviously  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5079) of the British and of the MI6 and so on  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5081) and when after after Islam came again in  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5084) the National domain after the start of  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5087) the Afghani war and also the coming of  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5089) the Iran revolution this regarding as  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5091) being a Shiite Evolution it's Evolution  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5093) but anyway and Islam became became on  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5097) the table internationally because before  
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5100) that Islam was forgotten nobody bothered  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5102) about Islam and always discussion  
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5104) discussed was nationalism socialism and  
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5108) so on that's a capitalism Islam was not  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5110) in the table it's a matter of discussion  
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5112) now it became a mess of General Discord  
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5114) so it seems to be you could say it is  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5118) really uh instigating War a warrior but  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5122) even in that  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5124) so in that case similar to government I  
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5127) sort of because the way he the  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5129) formulation to the people who read that  
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5131) they say it's really instigating the  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5132) Western instigating the image of Islam  
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5135) to to wage war against Muslims and to  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5137) step in against against the ancient  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5140) mujahideen and also against Iran that  
[1:25:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5143) was the purpose of that it seems to be I  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5145) didn't read that uh  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5147) I didn't read it but it is was in  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5151) support of active war in that case he  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5152) can visited as Oriel but with the usual  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5155) systems of War like for example  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5158) have the deficiency that not specify  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5161) that the one who are like for example in  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5163) England are excluded from that because  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5165) they have a covenant of security with  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5166) the regime here they cannot do at it  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5168) they are not party of the wars of the  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5170) Muslims so they cannot do anything to  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5172) Salman  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5173) but other people who are not having a  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5176) coincidence ability with the domain here  
[1:26:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5177) and certainly is not uh is not protected  
[1:26:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5181) which is the difficult with them they  
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5184) can't do that someone who is passing by  
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5186) someone if he's for example passing it  
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5188) in in Switzerland and we intercept him  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5190) there and you have no Covenant circuit  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5192) he would visit them because you are  
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5193) passing there you kill him that's fine  
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5195) because he's it's getting old that's  
[1:26:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5197) something like that but human is fatwa  
[1:26:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5199) is deficient it's not complete it's not  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5201) very well structured but assuming that  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5204) he's a Waging War and so on but he  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5206) didn't argue this way he's still in the  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5208) old school  
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5210) he's an original Cafe anyway  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5213) so the whole thing is is it has not been  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5215) done properly it could have been done  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5216) properly like carbon method of the  
[1:26:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5218) structured way but unfortunately it was  
[1:27:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5220) not  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5223) yeah  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5225) does it clarify the issue so they use  
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5230) that's what they use in terms of whoever  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5232) changes the deed and that's all around  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5233) uh  
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5235) again that's number one and besides he  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5240) did not make it there is motel from the  
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5241) beginning even before that  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5244) so there's no other evidences they bring  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5246) about the only thing that they bring up  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5249) nothing else and had it of the blind man  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5252) which is questionable but it's a if  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5254) someone did it in a moment of like like  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5257) say a temporary inside extreme anger  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5261) assuming that Hadith is authentic and  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5263) because there's the question mark about  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5264) even the structure of Hadith there's  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5266) some some school things like for example  
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5269) if it is so how come that she found dead  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5271) somewhere how come that but maybe he  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5274) explained that he was in a State of  
[1:27:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5276) Shock and fear and got help from some  
[1:27:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5278) relatives and they dumped her away I  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5279) think he can't get away at the moment  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5281) the fear of the action things like that  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5284) and this was an excuse by that he's a  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5286) state of fear did not know what to do  
[1:28:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5287) properly and things like that  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5290) because I I don't think that such a  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5292) point will be missed by the messenger of  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5294) Allah so the whole the whole the whole  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5295) transaction and the Hadith is there's a  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5298) question mark there at least  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5302) what we see that the one who are mocking  
[1:28:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5304) the prophet sallam in the Battle of  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5306) taboo going to tabuk that's much later  
[1:28:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5307) than the story of the blind man anyway  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5309) in the Battle of trouble going in the  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5311) battle of the book because the story of  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5313) blind man must be very early because it  
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5315) must be if it happened because uh the  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5318) the Ayah that do not hold the hand of  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5320) the cafe that men have to divorce cover  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5322) wives okay much earlier well before  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5325) tabuk  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5326) so he should have divorce here she would  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5328) not have been in his room with luck with  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5330) him anyway so if it has happened it must  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5332) be very early we have the latest  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5334) situation in the book in the battle that  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5337) someone African was sitting that and  
[1:28:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5339) there was a talking on joking about I  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5340) mean that messenger obviously we didn't  
[1:29:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5342) say I see any people who are more greedy  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5344) for money and more more pretending of  
[1:29:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5346) piety than the the Muhammad as His  
[1:29:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5349) companion  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5350) and then when the news came to messenger  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5352) Allah and the Ayah came down they are  
[1:29:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5354) mocking the Lord's messenger you are a  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5356) cafe they come and extreme said that we  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5358) were just a travel was very long and we  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5361) were bored and we're making making just  
[1:29:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5363) jokes not in our heart and Allah said  
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5366) are you making joke about all this  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5368) messenger don't bring excuses  
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5374) because Iman must be to such a level  
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5376) that Allah messenger are off limit to  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5379) that absolutely and then reminding him  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5381) that what had me said  
[1:29:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5385) that the one there was was one who  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5388) really was innocent and so on and he was  
[1:29:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5390) forgiven but he should have started  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5392) stood up at the left  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5394) but he did not do and there's again the  
[1:29:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5396) reminder that they assorted double will  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5398) come to it reminding that so and what I  
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5400) said did not kill them don't do anything  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5401) today  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5403) so this is and the Ayah is there and  
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5405) then narratives about its debt so  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5408) whatever you tended right left up and  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5410) down you're not going to get away  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5412) it's again if someone for in the domain  
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5415) does it is  
[1:30:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5417) not killed  
[1:30:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5419) outside the domain maybe he's he's his  
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5421) heartbeat that says then it has been  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5423) treated with the issue of War  
[1:30:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5427) either direct or Declaration or  
[1:30:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5429) assassination if necessary the  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5431) conditions are right for that in a  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5433) certain situation like a case of carbon  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5435) goes the right way  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5439) it's clear  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5441) yes  
[1:30:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5447) all he will bring all kinds of evidences  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5450) but they all go boils down to these two  
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5452) three things and all of them are faulty  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5454) because the fundamental point is that  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5456) what they call had the riddha is simply  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5459) not it doesn't exist there's no hadrid  
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5461) there and there's but you know must be  
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5464) interpreted if ever it is  
[1:31:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5468) Allegiance the who changed his  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5470) Allegiance relate to the monafertine  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5472) which left the domain and joined the  
[1:31:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5473) Arabic they become happy that's it so  
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5476) this is  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5478) and also it is  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5482) there could be something else clearly it  
[1:31:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5485) has to be interpreted like that  
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5487) because Dean could be meaning could be a  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5491) piety could be way meaning we love could  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5493) be also Allegiance could be judgment the  
[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5495) word deal has all these meaning  
[1:31:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5497) foreign  
[1:32:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5548) yeah  
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5549) or otherwise doesn't make any sense so  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5551) Dean is another again is is uh is a  
[1:32:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5555) judgment and ruling  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5558) how about Yousef saying he would not  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5560) have taken his brother uh according to  
[1:32:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5563) to the to the judgment and the law  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5565) system of the king so it had me various  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5568) things  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5571) who changed his judgment system and his  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5573) Allegiance  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5583) going back  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5596) this is answering back going back  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5600) going back  
[1:33:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5602) I've got two more questions before I  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5603) hand over to them  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5605) um so question are there are there any  
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5608) Scholars or theological schools of  
[1:33:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5610) thought which have views resembling the  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5613) yourself regarding NADA and others  
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5617) I mentioned  
[1:33:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5619) about the previous knowledge  
[1:33:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5622) that's that's one and the uh the earlier  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5625) it seems to be they they always was not  
[1:33:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5629) precise at the time that's a quite  
[1:33:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5631) simple man like for example the famous  
[1:33:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5632) Harry they usually invoke is that uh two  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5635) men narrate that they they were dispute  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5637) happening at the time of the normal and  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5639) so on  
[1:34:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5640) and they went to abnormal from all most  
[1:34:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5643) likely that after I've been Abbas  
[1:34:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5645) because if they want to be normal then  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5647) they showed that they are simple-minded  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5648) because even another is not the man to  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5650) be asked about this they should have got  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5652) if an Abbas is still alive they should  
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5653) so I'm assuming if they are  
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5655) sophisticated  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5657) the they have come after even Abbas has  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5659) gone and there's nobody really around us  
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5661) they can't trust that much acceptable  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5663) because  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5670) understanding just his stand with about  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5673) the fitna and not not really giving back  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5675) and supporting Ali show that he's not a  
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5677) man of deep understanding it's really  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5680) not about divider static I don't  
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5682) recognized himself that when someone  
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5683) suggested when someone said what's about  
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5686) him he's looking what do you think who  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5688) will deserve to be Khalifa after me and  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5690) someone said I said to him  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5695) he did not do that to please Allah they  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5698) want to please me for that do you want  
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5701) me to appoint someone or give to give  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5703) power to someone who is not able even to  
[1:35:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5705) divorce a wife which is worthy of  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5706) divorce  
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5708) so it doesn't have the Stream  
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5710) and here they get it in his deathbed  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5712) that he did not fight against  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5714) but it was totally it was 30 years there  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5716) and everything is gone and as I said the  
[1:35:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5718) birds have left and the trade has left  
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5720) the station but let's go back so these  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5722) two went to be normal so if it is every  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5724) time we will Abbas and other modes more  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5726) intellectual sahabi then it shows that  
[1:35:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5729) they are assembled minded and they said  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5730) one said we we extended from now one is  
[1:35:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5733) to it right until if and we told them  
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5735) that some people in our in our uh in our  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5739) city who they say there's no qadar and  
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5742) the Affairs are on of the Affairs are  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5744) starting anew  
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5746) foreign  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5780) there's no other that fundamentally  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5782) there is no other deity of the evil or  
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5784) no someone creating Evil by Rebellion  
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5786) against Allah doesn't work it's  
[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5787) impossible it's virtually impossible  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5790) so the evil in the universe is by  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5792) Allah's alarms to happen whatever it is  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5794) explain even it is the lack of goodness  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5796) as I said something negative it has to  
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5798) be because the universe is contingent  
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5800) and they cannot can never be divinely  
[1:36:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5802) perfect so there will be some old Comics  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5804) which is classified by evil whatever  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5806) interpret even it is it is by Allah's  
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5808) creation of permission  
[1:36:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5810) and he did not comment on the honor all  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5813) of meaning  
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5814) we we the future is open we can do our  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5818) future we can change our future he did  
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5819) not comment to that maybe he did not  
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5821) answer even all of the first place what  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5823) is it and many people read Hadith and  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5825) say that's that's the field and  
[1:37:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5827) established that their interpretation  
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5829) established that the future events are  
[1:37:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5831) all known that's their imagination but  
[1:37:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5833) that's not even the Hadith says I'm not  
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5835) talking about said he said I've seen  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5837) them who doesn't believe in the Allah  
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5839) will burn him in the hell file that's it  
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5841) that's all it is  
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5846) now there were people saying that their  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5848) mistake is  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5851) most likely  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5853) and that's confusion for example known  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5856) to be there's some accused of having  
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5858) been advocating Qatar essentially what  
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5860) we say essentially like that  
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5863) that people make the destiny Etc and so  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5865) on future events are not not really done  
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5867) until Allah exactly as I said  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5869) essentially but not in such a structure  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5871) the dead wave because things were fresh  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5873) at the beginning  
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5875) and people misunderstood that when he  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5878) made his second hatch because they made  
[1:38:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5880) only two heads in his life the first one  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5881) was at 54 hijri something like that  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5884) after coming from Corazon after his  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5886) battle campaign and so on and the second  
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5888) one in the year 100 this is very good to  
[1:38:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5890) come it's very well documented scholar  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5893) and someone asked him he hit that Hassan  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5896) is khadari  
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5898) the nice color or sorry which is the  
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5900) mistake he doesn't  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5904) if you say he asked him share  
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5908) who created the devil  
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5912) recipes there's any other Creator except  
[1:38:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5916) Allah  
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5917) so most likely that you use  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5920) meaning he thinks the Qatar is made by  
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5922) the devil and then who made the devil  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5924) then  
[1:38:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5925) you see the point so it's good and evil  
[1:38:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5928) it's again so the man is thinking Hassan  
[1:38:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5931) is brother in the sense of denial that  
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5934) evil is not created by Allah  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5937) foreign  
[1:39:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5948) so that was this that was there because  
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5951) it was not very clear  
[1:39:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5952) and the people not developed  
[1:39:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5956) it would not have happened unless Allah  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5958) has permitted us to gain power and then  
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5961) conclude from that our our being  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5963) involved position is sanctioned by Allah  
[1:39:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5965) that's that's about what they want they  
[1:39:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5967) don't care about belief on it and they  
[1:39:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5969) don't bother they don't bother about  
[1:39:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5970) Islam honestly  
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5973) so if you rebel against us you are  
[1:39:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5975) rebelling against our decision which has  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5976) been made before the creation of the  
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5978) universe  
[1:39:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5981) that's it that's where the disease  
[1:39:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5983) started which may still show up so the  
[1:39:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5985) issue was never discussed except except  
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5987) in respectable pulling the salt for  
[1:39:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5990) anyone claiming that they have to come  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5992) to power legitimately  
[1:39:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5994) because they were able to confuse most  
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5996) people that coming to Paul with Allah  
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=5999) wanted that and he likes it no  
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6002) foreign  
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6011) so that's the confusion of essentially  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6013) after that the the most dominant point  
[1:40:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6015) of view was essentially except the  
[1:40:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6018) martezida  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6019) and that's not in a very structured way  
[1:40:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6021) either  
[1:40:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6022) they could not settle the issue with  
[1:40:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6024) Divine knowledge and things like that  
[1:40:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6026) properly  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6027) is the one who they are saying the  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6030) future is the future events are not  
[1:40:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6032) known  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6033) until Allah decided to make them  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6039) it connected to that under razi and his  
[1:40:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6041) mentioning his point of view  
[1:40:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6043) did not have the answer said don't we  
[1:40:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6045) agree with the rest of Allah knows the  
[1:40:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6047) things but his knowledge does not  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6048) enforce anything Allah's knowledge is  
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6050) enforcing because our knowledge cannot  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6052) tend to be wrong so it has it has to be  
[1:40:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6054) it must be somehow forced is either  
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6056) force on him so he's a mechanism  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6059) or it is not false in him so it cannot  
[1:41:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6061) happen  
[1:41:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6063) that's the issue  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6064) I'll be saying that we would agree with  
[1:41:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6067) the list of the ummah that and divine  
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6068) knowledge does not mean that you don't  
[1:41:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6070) have a free choice it means you cannot  
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6072) have it because Divine knowledge is not  
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6074) like human knowledge humanology is never  
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6075) absolute because you are not dominant  
[1:41:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6077) you're not the Creator is dominant it's  
[1:41:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6080) absolutely dominant  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6082) so if you know something will happen  
[1:41:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6083) it's going to happen it's not Escape  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6086) and he must have permitted to happen and  
[1:41:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6088) he must decide it now or before or any  
[1:41:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6090) time in the past before The Happening  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6091) that it will happen there's no way no  
[1:41:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6093) Escape it's impossible otherwise the the  
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6096) supports which can work in the universe  
[1:41:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6098) without Allah permission and Allah is  
[1:41:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6099) not the absolute dominant one  
[1:41:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6103) okay before I hand over trouble we'll  
[1:41:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6105) have a good question so that's that's it  
[1:41:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6108) so this is what if anyone it was I've  
[1:41:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6110) been it had been recent example of the  
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6112) Divine foreign  
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6116) would have taken that but I think he at  
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6118) his time he could not dare doing that he  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6121) will be in trouble  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6123) most likely the people who stole him or  
[1:42:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6124) kill him at the time people were deeply  
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6127) stuck in in ashari or or Ahmed by Humble  
[1:42:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6129) poetry is not clearly structure say  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6133) there's a there's a Qatar in the  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6135) beginning of the universe every month  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6138) this is audiences there's only one call  
[1:42:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6141) at the beginning  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6144) change is the meaning of the thing the  
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6146) the future events are not known in  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6149) advance  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6149) until the unearthedral is exactly what  
[1:42:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6153) you are saying but he never said that  
[1:42:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6155) oh they got stuck in this in this  
[1:42:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6157) internal contribution because nobody  
[1:42:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6159) there sitting and and they're thinking  
[1:42:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6161) that made attacks Allah knowledge Allah  
[1:42:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6164) it's not it's the utmost possible  
[1:42:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6167) Patrick one a world future contingencies  
[1:42:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6169) are not that's more than future events  
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6172) are dictated by something or like I mean  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6175) says that that the events or the things  
[1:42:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6179) are fabitable Adam will establish in  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6182) nothingness imagine that something is  
[1:43:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6184) well established in absolutely nothing  
[1:43:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6186) is the only interpretation is really  
[1:43:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6188) established in Allah knowledge  
[1:43:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6201) that all in existence is actually only  
[1:43:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6204) one being it appears to us that's  
[1:43:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6206) multiplicity but it's only one thing  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6208) that's right resolution is is that is a  
[1:43:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6211) nice formulation for atheism as learning  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6213) recognized say what a very nice  
[1:43:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6215) formulation for atheism and materialism  
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6217) just giving it materialism or giving it  
[1:43:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6219) a spiritual paint  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6224) that's it which is not  
[1:43:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6227) it's not about a definition of a God but  
[1:43:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6229) making it somehow spiritual making  
[1:43:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6231) somehow the divinity  
[1:43:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6233) which is not  
[1:43:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6236) okay before I hand over I just got  
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6238) another question  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6239) um so this is a question we discussed  
[1:44:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6241) very briefly earlier  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6244) the messenger of Allah said when he said  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6248) when you hear a man saying people are  
[1:44:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6250) destroyed then he is the most destroyed  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6251) of them  
[1:44:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6252) the question is can you ask us can you  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6255) can you go through some etiquettes  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6257) around discussing with your some context  
[1:44:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6258) around this exactly that's that's that's  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6260) if someone's here all people are  
[1:44:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6263) perished meaning most likely that he is  
[1:44:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6265) looking down on the people that they are  
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6267) there and he thinks that he's the only  
[1:44:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6268) one survived  
[1:44:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6270) if he said I am perished for the people  
[1:44:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6272) there's something else  
[1:44:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6274) people are polished meaning he is the  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6276) one who is not perished he's the one who  
[1:44:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6278) is absolutely right and everyone is  
[1:44:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6279) otherwise wrong and they are going to  
[1:44:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6282) hell he's the only one surviving he's  
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6284) the one that will you save it  
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6286) and then Mr said he's the most perished  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6288) one of them because this attitude the  
[1:44:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6290) attitude of  
[1:44:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6291) who who have Kimberly the camera is  
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6294) having two components one of it is  
[1:44:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6296) rejecting the truth  
[1:44:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6298) and as you see that in Madras and so on  
[1:45:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6301) and the secondly is  
[1:45:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6303) looking at the people down this is the  
[1:45:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6305) most West type of looking at the  
[1:45:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6307) building that they are perished  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6309) not to have a saved one  
[1:45:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6310) hello  
[1:45:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6313) and this is exactly what the people who  
[1:45:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6315) say we are the same with the same effect  
[1:45:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6317) that means that others are not saved so  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6320) they are perished then definitely are  
[1:45:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6322) not the same effect that's that's it  
[1:45:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6324) that's it that's fundamentally shows  
[1:45:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6327) that you are the the most perishing one  
[1:45:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6330) that definitely there may have state  
[1:45:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6331) like that I didn't believe like that  
[1:45:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6333) shows that you are the perishing one  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6342) that's it  
[1:45:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6344) and this is the control strict  
[1:45:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6346) injunction against the Jewish behavior  
[1:45:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6348) of purifying themselves  
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6356) Allah knows how he created you from mud  
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6359) and your shortcomings so don't try to  
[1:46:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6361) purify and present yourself as pure and  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6364) holy no you are not  
[1:46:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6371) like a quick note before going to my  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6374) main point uh you know when you said  
[1:46:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6376) that uh uh  
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6378) sarafi they say that do not sit and  
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6382) debate them well I don't know where the  
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6385) statement comes from because  
[1:46:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6387) he himself he himself he sits and debate  
[1:46:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6391) with the all uh all sorts of like Shia  
[1:46:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6395) and  
[1:46:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6396) everyone so even  
[1:46:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6399) Tamia he he he debated everyone does not  
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6404) sit and so on and doesn't listen to he  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6406) just attack them and they mean them  
[1:46:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6408) that's the so he's literally doing a  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6410) real debate he's doing just attack the  
[1:46:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6412) battles using the most abusive language  
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6414) usually if he's debating  
[1:46:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6416) for example his photo was just  
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6419) concerning with me first then I will  
[1:47:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6420) come to the point  
[1:47:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6422) every 10 minutes  
[1:47:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6431) Free Will and things like that I don't  
[1:47:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6434) know if this is very structured like I  
[1:47:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6435) presented but it's better than what the  
[1:47:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6438) the so-called Sunni and Asha rehab  
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6440) alhambali  
[1:47:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6447) so high  
[1:47:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6449) that may make him even so beautiful  
[1:47:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6453) anybody at that time said just out of of  
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6456) out of Miller just over uh to make the  
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6461) other side feel bad and hurt them not to  
[1:47:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6463) expose the truth it's clearly and even  
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6466) his follower now when we invoke remember  
[1:47:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6469) in the Hadith when we have some of his  
[1:47:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6473) statements and people came back say this  
[1:47:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6475) was in the debate with the Shia but  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6477) that's not what his point of view what  
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6478) he says when he's not debating so it is  
[1:48:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6480) the difference between what he what he  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6481) says when he allegedly when he's not  
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6484) debating and when he's debating this  
[1:48:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6486) means this is this is a kind of Miller  
[1:48:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6488) and in fact if you are not debating you  
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6490) are just attacking the other side and  
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6491) bringing everything even against your  
[1:48:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6493) belief and this fundamentally wrong and  
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6495) faulty every time you leave this one  
[1:48:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6497) it's not saying that is gank  
[1:48:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6505) and there is another one who said don't  
[1:48:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6507) sit today I say if I I said it because  
[1:48:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6509) I've said one more thing I would  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6511) describe  
[1:48:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6512) I want to ask you one question say no no  
[1:48:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6514) that's it even one word say not even one  
[1:48:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6516) word and run away and he said don't  
[1:48:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6519) listen to them maybe it will cause your  
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6521) heart to become to come weak or  
[1:48:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6522) something like that this is all this is  
[1:48:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6524) Alhambra  
[1:48:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6527) even even if something worse I have  
[1:48:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6530) collected that it's narrated by a Halal  
[1:48:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6533) is one of the major students of Ahmad  
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6535) and a very honest man extended  
[1:48:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6538) is that hinares for example that Ahmed  
[1:49:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6541) used to call many Hadith as Hadith  
[1:49:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6545) and then when he was at abdulillah  
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6550) and we have an example of what Hadith  
[1:49:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6552) according to him which is one of the  
[1:49:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6553) best I Hadith  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6556) then he said come to a section because  
[1:49:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6559) he obviously divided the session into  
[1:49:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6562) various Hadith and various topics  
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6565) then he stand up go far away and close  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6567) his ears so he cannot hear  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6569) foreign  
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6596) the people hate that he collected his  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6598) Hadith I'll tell the good Hadith  
[1:50:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6614) runs away I throw it in in an oven burn  
[1:50:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6618) it it's a criminal act  
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6621) if someone asks us  
[1:50:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6625) if it happens like that and they find us  
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6645) because you just you don't like them  
[1:50:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6649) matter is much more serious than you  
[1:50:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6651) think  
[1:50:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6651) and older older than ever older than you  
[1:50:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6655) think much worse maybe even Tamia is a  
[1:50:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6656) little bit better than that and that but  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6658) even tell me as debates are really not  
[1:51:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6660) really a debate to reach the truth it's  
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6662) a debate to show it to make the other  
[1:51:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6665) side  
[1:51:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6666) uh  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6668) be low and and bring the worst at them  
[1:51:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6671) and bring and exaggerate in the other  
[1:51:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6675) side and until until you I think you can  
[1:51:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6678) defeat them that's it it's an attempt to  
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6680) defeat the other one disregarding if  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6682) he's truthful or not truthfully which is  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6684) the worst type of debate to be honest  
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6686) it's not a debate it is not even the  
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6688) debate it is what you call it is  
[1:51:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6690) rebuttals or  
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6692) apologetic uh abuse or something like  
[1:51:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6695) that yes yes a Prof on a different  
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6698) matter don't you agree that there's a  
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6702) thin line between a mockery and uh  
[1:51:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6705) criticization and and this thin line is  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6709) often not very clear for people right so  
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6713) so for you so for example no no then  
[1:51:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6716) then  
[1:51:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6717) stick to it  
[1:52:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6720) like for example someone let's let's say  
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6722) for example they claim the professor is  
[1:52:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6724) pretty affiliate because he married  
[1:52:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6725) Aisha at night exactly I was going to  
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6727) give this example  
[1:52:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6729) if someone say we concise that from a  
[1:52:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6731) modern point of view Etc but you can't  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6733) tell him that was another time and the  
[1:52:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6735) law was different look at the law of the  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6737) israelit and so on this is the debate  
[1:52:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6739) that's been critical but she said your  
[1:52:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6741) point of view is wrong because you're  
[1:52:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6742) looking from the Vantage time of this  
[1:52:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6744) time not at the at the law of the Jews  
[1:52:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6747) and the law of the the Christian before  
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6748) that it was it was even until recently  
[1:52:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6751) in America it was six years that the  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6753) minimum age of marriage in many states  
[1:52:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6755) and I think it's still in some states  
[1:52:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6756) increase tonight  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6759) but we do not know  
[1:52:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6761) but that's that's what that at that time  
[1:52:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6763) it was perfectly legitimate he's in  
[1:52:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6765) supervisor with the time he's a man of  
[1:52:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6767) his type Assuming he's a man even in  
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6770) that  
[1:52:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6771) you are getting the definition that's is  
[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6773) that mockery better say uh he's a he's a  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6776) filthy uh pedophilia that's his mokary  
[1:52:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6779) and this insult it's different Benzene  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6782) but this marriage is the pedophiles no  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6785) it's not because of this and this okay  
[1:53:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6793) yes yes so I I think the other Ayah that  
[1:53:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6796) you mentioned which is in Surat and Nisa  
[1:53:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6799) when Allah says  
[1:53:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6808) yes yes here Allah he he he clarified  
[1:53:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6813) that those people are mocking I mean he  
[1:53:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6816) said  
[1:53:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6817) so so here it's very clear  
[1:53:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6821) how is including that just going back  
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6824) and forth and pray playfully and this is  
[1:53:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6828) more precise but it was clear what it  
[1:53:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6831) means so so if we were to draw a line to  
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6835) differentiate between criticization and  
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6837) mockery I would say from my point of  
[1:54:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6840) view that uh alisteza which is the one  
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6843) that is not permitted is is to take the  
[1:54:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6846) words and action to play for and for our  
[1:54:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6850) play and foreign  
[1:54:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6857) it's like that it is just playful just  
[1:54:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6860) stand that button go that's all  
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6862) yes yes but but how would you  
[1:54:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6864) differentiate between your differentiate  
[1:54:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6867) in the session you will feel it and you  
[1:54:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6868) will know it  
[1:54:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6870) yes yes so you don't you don't you don't  
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6873) need a hand holding the people in a  
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6875) small tree the people know that they  
[1:54:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6877) know that we if you go to a movie you  
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6879) know if it is if it is a comedy or it is  
[1:54:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6881) a tragedy  
[1:54:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6883) you know that  
[1:54:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6885) these are basic things human beings  
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6887) perceive  
[1:54:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6890) yes yes so I think I think I think uh  
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6895) for me the the two important thing is  
[1:54:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6898) that being sincere and being truthful in  
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6901) criticization otherwise it becomes a  
[1:55:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6903) mockery right if if if we were just to  
[1:55:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6906) take the words and actions for fun and  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6909) for play for and just to be pleased it  
[1:55:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6912) from the other side the injunction is  
[1:55:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6915) for you to stand up and go it's not for  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6917) you in in jedal the injection for for  
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6920) you in Israel is clear in the Quran  
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6927) by evidence and by respectful terms  
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6930) that's excellent otherwise there's not  
[1:55:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6933) accident it's my bad  
[1:55:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6936) yes yes  
[1:55:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6938) debate for example uh with a Christian  
[1:55:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6941) for example about Trinity you say come  
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6943) on here you worship of three idols  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6945) that's insult that's not a debate you're  
[1:55:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6947) starting with insulting come and explain  
[1:55:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6950) me the Trinity and I'll show you that it  
[1:55:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6952) cannot be possibly a rationally  
[1:55:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6954) conceivable and this is not found in the  
[1:55:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6956) description that's okay  
[1:55:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6958) and even if you start a bit with him you  
[1:56:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6960) talk to him a respectable language  
[1:56:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6961) you'll say come come your pick I will  
[1:56:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6963) show you you are wrong no  
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6965) foreign  
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6979) interaction you know the difference  
[1:56:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6981) between uh between  
[1:56:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6984) uh  
[1:56:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6985) everyone will perceive it even if even a  
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6988) street sweeper no right right Prophet I  
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6991) totally agree with you and I know I I  
[1:56:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6993) know for a fact the differentiation  
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6995) between mockery and criticization but  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6997) for other people I mean I mean you know  
[1:56:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=6999) if for example you talked about the  
[1:56:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7001) Trinity for some Christians just  
[1:56:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7003) undermining the Divinity of Jesus is is  
[1:56:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7006) is is a mockery to their religion no no  
[1:56:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7009) you know so no it's not no it's not it's  
[1:56:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7011) not a mocha you know  
[1:56:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7013) like for example the same people who  
[1:56:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7015) make the cartoon they they they make  
[1:56:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7018) they make a mockery of the trinity in a  
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7020) cartoon by showing I think uh three  
[1:57:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7022) persons and one of them is having  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7023) another person uh us with an arrow in  
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7027) the ass or something like that  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7029) um  
[1:57:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7030) come on  
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7032) I think that's that's just no it's not  
[1:57:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7036) okay  
[1:57:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7036) this is not this is not true a Divine  
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7039) being is not a trinity it's the only one  
[1:57:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7041) because it's only one but three and  
[1:57:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7042) three in one okay let's discuss that and  
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7044) what's the scripture a reason for that  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7047) the reason for that like we once have  
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7049) you remember we're not there but but I  
[1:57:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7051) think if if Mr dot or Mr sokolatis is  
[1:57:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7055) here agent was possibly uh there was a  
[1:57:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7059) session and someone came and said the  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7061) whole problem with the Trinity is that  
[1:57:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7062) it managed to to make Jesus divine  
[1:57:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7065) without violating the monotheism of the  
[1:57:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7066) Old Testament but the Divinity of Jesus  
[1:57:49](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7069) is based on uh but so if you drop that  
[1:57:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7072) get rid of that just follow the  
[1:57:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7074) scripture the the three the three  
[1:57:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7077) gospels and even Jon  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7078) hence strongly for Divinity but not  
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7081) conclusively if we take that the solid  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7084) core of all he's not Divine and he  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7086) declare him not to be divine then we  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7088) don't need all of this acrobatic  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7091) he's a created being so dividing is one  
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7093) entity and because he could be divine  
[1:58:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7096) then the Holy Spirit or the spiritual to  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7098) be divine otherwise it doesn't work  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7100) that's what produced acidity that's the  
[1:58:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7102) stages came from  
[1:58:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7104) so let's go to basic one basic one is  
[1:58:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7107) clear the man's secretary clearly that  
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7109) he is not equal to the father and that's  
[1:58:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7111) only the father is good how could you  
[1:58:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7113) call me good I am good etc etc  
[1:58:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7115) even the screaming with the cross  
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7117) Assuming he's the one screaming at the  
[1:58:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7118) cause I I think he's not have someone  
[1:58:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7120) else but that's another issue if he's  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7122) that they say why did you forsake me  
[1:58:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7125) that's that's not the the way a Divine  
[1:58:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7128) expressing himself  
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7130) so let's take out Facebook say this is  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7131) the human Jesus saying so the human  
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7133) Jesus is only suffering at the Divine  
[1:58:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7134) what happened is not suffering so the  
[1:58:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7137) Divine was not sacrificed so he came a  
[1:58:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7139) sacrifice not to be a Divine being just  
[1:59:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7141) sacrifice a human being  
[1:59:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7144) an innocent what would have been worse  
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7146) for Allah  
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7147) you see that's that's not mockery if I  
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7150) say I am doubtful it's not what I say I  
[1:59:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7153) am doubtful according to evidence you  
[1:59:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7155) have there's no evidence for the Persian  
[1:59:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7158) death because the story of the Christmas  
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7160) story is does not make any sense  
[1:59:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7161) contradicts many historic facts  
[1:59:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7163) a mockery will be saying come on this  
[1:59:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7165) man is the son of so and so on  
[1:59:27](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7167) yes this is the insult  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7171) yes yes yes  
[1:59:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7173) maybe he doesn't really in wedlock from  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7177) from Joseph the Carpenter and they made  
[1:59:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7179) him then with the Christian exaggerate  
[1:59:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7181) we know that's not true because of the  
[1:59:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7183) Quran but why why conclude that his  
[1:59:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7185) mother is a harlot or something like  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7187) that no could be the son of Jose  
[1:59:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7190) Carpenter but that people would imagine  
[1:59:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7191) that for some prophecy they think the  
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7193) Virgin will give birth they mistaken  
[1:59:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7195) that and applied Theresa maybe at that  
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7197) time at least  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7198) until the Quran clarified that  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7201) maybe something else  
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7203) maybe she was raped  
[2:00:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7207) there's so many explanations of a virgin  
[2:00:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7209) giving a birth  
[2:00:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7212) out of it look one of them is today for  
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7214) example  
[2:00:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7216) why say Harlot maybe she was a rip  
[2:00:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7220) um I don't know I think there's a  
[2:00:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7222) difference between objective discussion  
[2:00:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7224) respectful discussion with others  
[2:00:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7226) between abusive and abuse and insult  
[2:00:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7228) like for example a guy here a Jewish  
[2:00:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7231) scholar Still Alive in Oxford I think or  
[2:00:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7233) Cambridge  
[2:00:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7234) and he talks about the ethics which like  
[2:00:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7237) the story about not stoning the  
[2:00:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7238) adulterers  
[2:00:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7240) so what he comments of that see this is  
[2:00:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7242) the perfect ethic of bastards  
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7246) and he is obviously a  
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7250) uh saving the prostitute from being  
[2:00:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7253) stoned because he knows that his origin  
[2:00:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7255) is like that this is this is a major  
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7258) insult  
[2:00:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7259) from this vermis  
[2:01:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7262) a befitting ideology for by slots  
[2:01:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7264) imagine that what he hints he didn't say  
[2:01:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7266) that Jesus Master directly but clearly  
[2:01:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7268) from the context is clear what he means  
[2:01:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7271) that's an insult I wonder that someone  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7273) like that I must say that you should  
[2:01:16](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7276) check me out because some people should  
[2:01:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7277) some people should go and split in his  
[2:01:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7279) face for that  
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7280) [Music]  
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7281) um  
[2:01:22](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7282) yes so I think I think the key is to be  
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7286) sincere and truthful uh when debating  
[2:01:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7288) with other people who who have different  
[2:01:31](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7291) beliefs and different point of views yes  
[2:01:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7293) yeah  
[2:01:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7294) yes yes you know you know Professor why  
[2:01:37](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7297) I opened this kind of the other side of  
[2:01:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7299) the other that's from our side if the  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7300) other side starts going to uh up and  
[2:01:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7303) down in things which looks mockery or  
[2:01:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7304) like make a joke just leave this  
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7306) wavering then just leave it stand up and  
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7308) go you don't need to kill them just they  
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7310) know it says that they're having a  
[2:01:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7313) session of enjoyment  
[2:01:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7316) yeah if you want to have enjoyment let  
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7318) us pay maybe maybe you play cards if you  
[2:02:00](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7320) play bridge or something else I'm ready  
[2:02:02](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7322) to play with you but not this simple  
[2:02:04](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7324) yeah we need some time for enjoyment and  
[2:02:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7327) have relaxation okay but not in this  
[2:02:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7328) matter let's have something or let's  
[2:02:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7330) maybe make a joke about the American  
[2:02:12](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7332) president that's okay  
[2:02:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7333) although I don't like maybe in my  
[2:02:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7335) position I love him or about the king  
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7337) here maybe he doesn't deserve but let's  
[2:02:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7339) make a joke it's okay it's bad manner  
[2:02:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7341) maybe but it's not it's not the red line  
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7343) of divinity and Mr Jones or people  
[2:02:26](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7346) supposed to be the Divinity lives out  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7348) and we have the injunction also don't  
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7350) don't insult the gods of the disbeliever  
[2:02:32](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7352) otherwise they will come back and do  
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7353) something else from that  
[2:02:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7356) so all what you say this Shiva does not  
[2:02:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7358) exist it's just an imaginary  
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7359) construction of History developing from  
[2:02:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7361) previous  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7365) up there that's the same problem  
[2:02:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7368) doesn't make any sense it's actually  
[2:02:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7370) counter defeating it's assuming he  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7372) exists on his son of a no he  
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7374) doesn't exist it's just an imagination  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7376) developed in history because originate  
[2:02:57](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7377) was the the god of the wind and became  
[2:02:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7379) the god of the mountain and things like  
[2:03:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7381) that and became a part of the three  
[2:03:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7383) major deities and it's in Morris area of  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7386) India and other areas there's another  
[2:03:08](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7388) major deity which is Durga and so on  
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7389) that's objective discussion without  
[2:03:11](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7391) insulting  
[2:03:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7395) yes yes yes yes yes I think so I think  
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7398) it's clear it's clear but it is  
[2:03:21](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7401) following the footsteps of people who  
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7404) are definitely defeated intellectually  
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7405) uncapable like a certain and so on and  
[2:03:28](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7408) and  
[2:03:30](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7410) Tamia is not debating is abusing the  
[2:03:33](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7413) other side and using argument which he  
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7415) knows is wrong because the the people  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7418) defending him like  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7420) that he's saying that into innovating  
[2:03:43](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7423) just to put him in the corner and Yeti  
[2:03:47](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7427) when you talk about your ideal type you  
[2:03:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7428) look highly and positive and so on this  
[2:03:50](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7430) show that he has a double standard  
[2:03:51](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7431) that's that's not debating that's  
[2:03:54](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7434) abusing the other side this is not this  
[2:03:55](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7435) is not bringing the truth yes because if  
[2:03:59](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7439) he admits the hierarchy that's why he  
[2:04:01](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7441) admits elsewhere and so on then he has  
[2:04:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7443) to argue more structure and he doesn't  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7445) know he doesn't have the argument he  
[2:04:07](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7447) would be defeated and he doesn't want to  
[2:04:09](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7449) be defeated  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7450) right it's like the German he's a  
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7453) self-righteous righteousness  
[2:04:15](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7455) he wants other people to be perished but  
[2:04:18](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7458) then he becomes the most perishing one  
[2:04:19](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7459) that's it it's the same  
[2:04:23](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7463) that's attitude  
[2:04:25](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7465) foreign  
[2:04:34](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7474) and come to the middle point of the  
[2:04:36](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7476) solution especially in complex issues  
[2:04:38](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7478) like the the civil war between Muslims  
[2:04:41](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7481) at that time you make up to a better  
[2:04:42](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7482) much better point of view if you admit  
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7484) to the truth  
[2:04:48](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7488) yes yes it's clear yes  
[2:04:53](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7493) we don't have to accept every 40 minutes  
[2:04:56](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7496) to Munich  
[2:05:03](https://youtu.be/3opiqJ46CVg?t=7503) thank you
