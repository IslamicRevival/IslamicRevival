[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=94) the professor continues the  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=96) interpretation of Surah we are on Ayah  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=100) 38.  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=102) sorry sort of  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=104) my apologies certain maida 38. it's  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=108) correct  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=110) oh yeah sorry yeah yes you're right yes  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=133) although there is no Beast that walks on  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=135) Earth and no bird that flies on its two  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=138) Wings which is not God's creature like  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=140) yourselves no thing or thing have we  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=143) neglected in our decree and once again  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=145) unto their sustainer they all they shall  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=148) all be gathered next translation  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=151) every Beast that crawls on the earth and  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=154) every birds that fly with its two Wings  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=156) have formed communities like you we have  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=159) left nothing out of the book they will  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=161) be gathered through their lord yeah so  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=164) let's just the meaning is very clear but  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=167) there's some some issues which are the  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=169) odd so Beast or is actually the word dab  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=172) from the beep from the when you walk the  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=175) sound is the beep so any any material  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=177) being which is made out of metal  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=179) uh  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=185) obviously we know now that even light is  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=188) having uh in that sense can be affected  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=190) by a tissue but there's so many that can  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=192) be ignored so things which are having  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=194) weight have right and if they walk they  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=196) sort of make a sound this is a dab that  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=199) to distinguish them from angels and  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=200) spirits and demos and things like that  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=202) so whatever daba is in it or a bird  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=205) Which flies with two wings  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=208) it's interesting to think why you  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=210) mentioned a bit better flying with his  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=211) two wings uh evidently all bears have  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=214) two wings but maybe a hint that being  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=217) winged with two Wings is a minimum  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=219) there's no way you can fly with one week  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=220) it may be it may be uh One Wing will  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=223) have two or two branches left a left and  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=225) right that is actually two Wings this  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=226) Wing is is a Double Wing like the  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=229) so-called flying wing it looks like but  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=231) it's actually shaped uh as a really has  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=235) two wings of a joint together so the  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=237) appears they call the flying goodness  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=238) cycle the flying two Wings join together  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=241) but anyway that's a secondary point  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=243) and the things that I see that they  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=245) thought it has struggling with the  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=247) translation  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=249) usually people will translate as Nations  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=252) or communities but the word Imam wrote  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=255) amama in Arabic is having very rich  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=257) meanings  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=259) first of all it is uh  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=262) it means that something was leading of  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=263) the forehead or the one who leads the  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=266) Imam the leader the leader Community for  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=269) example  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=271) let's ask him uh uh he tested him  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=274) certain tests and they said I'm going to  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=276) appoint you Adidas foreign  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=283) why why I'm saying that because uh in  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=286) some deal with she I said Ibrahim was  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=288) appointed Imam Muhammad Imam and they  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=290) might also have to be appointed I say  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=292) every minute luxury leaders that's fine  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=294) now we're not discussing that that's not  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=295) an issue that's not a major issue if you  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=298) mean a head of state he was not head of  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=299) state and Muhammad was ahead of himself  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=300) sometime and they were upside him does  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=302) not necessary to be head of state  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=304) one of them became 100 state or two Ali  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=307) and Hassan and the other not so that's  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=308) just a side note  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=310) is a community and I mean it's something  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=313) connected to certain connecting  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=315) principle like for example when uh when  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=319) when Musa came to the water of media the  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=322) world of Wonder he found that um  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=325) a collection of people  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=327) which have something binding them what's  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=329) binding them is that they come to uh to  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=332) uh water or give water to the the  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=334) animals so this the spirit was making  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=337) them coming together in that place  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=339) otherwise they are scattered everyone  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=340) Grazing In His Valley elsewhere but now  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=342) they become after being scattered yes  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=345) scattered people they became like an  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=347) ummah but through the nation is just a  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=349) group which having a certain activity at  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=351) a certain time and it means also a time  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=354) which is connected one piece of one long  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=356) time which has no gaps a well example  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=359) for that is in Surah Yusuf when he  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=362) interpreted the dreams of the two  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=363) companions in jail  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=365) and told the one the one who I believe  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=370) they would be surviving because in the  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=371) vision one dream that bears will be  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=374) eating from his head so it keeps it is  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=376) it is to assume that it's this one is  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=378) the one who will be crucified and the  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=380) Bears will it is his head  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=384) and the other one was was was uh was a  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=388) pouring hammer or squeezinger and making  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=391) use of hormones experimenting and this  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=393) one is the one who will be giving a  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=395) drink to his Lord and this one was over  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=397) it was most likely before that employed  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=399) in the Royal Palace  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=401) but by is it not necessary sometimes you  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=404) see a dream for someone else and someone  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=405) say for you so  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=407) it may be possible that the one who saw  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=409) that he is crucified is not the one who  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=411) will crucified the one who will be saved  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=412) and so on and that's a possibility is  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=413) there keep that in mind for dreams it's  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=415) not 33 in dream is appealing to me for  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=417) you is not necessary for you maybe for  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=419) your cousin for someone else and vice  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=421) versa but this is one one possibility  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=424) and the product as you mentioned that in  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=426) Hadith saying  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=431) for him  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=433) so that's it and he will be representing  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=436) that moment in the dream so this  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=437) possibility but obviously Joseph knew or  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=439) uh with with on the balance of privacy  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=442) who will be surviving and then he told  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=444) the one who will survive remember to  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=447) tell your lord my situation that I am  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=449) imprisoned and justifying that's what  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=451) but this one was jubilant when he was  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=453) released and when the Lord is the king  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=455) appointed him again as a chief the drink  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=458) or something like that and he forget  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=461) completely  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=462) completely it's amazing that this  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=464) happens  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=465) he completely how do we know that when  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=469) the king saw his vision  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=470) suddenly as if waking up to a dream he  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=473) remembered after  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=479) um  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=480) after prolonged time with no break in  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=483) that time there was Allah that he did  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=485) not even have any second and which  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=487) remembered what what she also told him  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=489) otherwise he would have approached his  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=491) King but we complete it was erased from  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=493) his mind until the vision that's  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=495) obviously most likely by Allah but this  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=497) can't happen it can happen very well  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=499) that you remember something  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=501) completely or you forget something  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=503) completely and remembered maybe years  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=506) after  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=508) you remember that has happened to me for  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=511) example it's a in a secondary issue but  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=513) it's not a second in some sense I  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=515) remember wearing everyone's traveling in  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=517) Germany in my in the 60s and uh and uh I  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=522) I decided for some reason I want to do  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=523) I'll do also later  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=525) yeah  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=526) and I forgot to do that  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=530) until recently  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=532) I remember the story did I do it no I  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=535) remember that family I didn't do it  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=537) after that until that day I made it up  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=539) 50 years later so hey anyway so it can  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=543) happen it kind of Israel that can happen  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=544) in that case maybe by Allah's  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=546) intervention he wanted to keep Yusuf in  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=548) prison for this time so that he can  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=550) develop his character and Dodge in  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=552) meditation indulging Dua and Elgin  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=553) prayer being in prison sometimes in a  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=556) considerable time of self-improvement  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=558) and self-portion so don't take prison is  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=560) always negative it's negative for  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=562) negative people but this could be  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=565) correcting an improvements for people  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=567) who have a core of goodness that they  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=569) can grow it while being in prison  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=570) because you have nothing else to do  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=571) except maybe some work and some  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=573) imprisonment that they are obliged to do  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=575) some work and so on for earning or for  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=577) not earning depending about the  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=578) different system but there's an  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=579) opportunity to reflect and think about  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=581) yourself and analyze further and develop  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=583) further anyway  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=584) whatever the reason Allah Allah Knows  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=587) Best  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=588) that remembered after um  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=592) leadership no  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=595) is connected  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=597) with a thread of complete forgetfulness  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=600) through that so it is it so all these  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=604) animals and birds  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=605) are umam  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=607) communities having something connecting  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=610) them obviously we know how it's  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=612) connected genetically they have the same  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=614) the same number of chromosomes and other  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=617) features a certain uh joint uh genetic  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=621) markups and so on even if they have the  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=623) same number of chromosome like another  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=624) species they have distinct which  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=626) distinguishing  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=628) uh my uh Marcus from the other Etc  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=632) but also they have certain joint  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=636) type of instinct and so on classifying  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=638) them and possibly there are even smaller  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=641) groups living in one area like from  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=643) Lions they live like in Prides and their  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=645) scattered we have lines up here we have  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=647) Lions still in India it's smaller than  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=649) the lands of Africa and there were lands  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=651) in between all the way but because of  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=652) the advanced  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=654) desertification in the last three four  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=657) thousand years uh the Arabian Peninsula  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=660) has lost its lines the same with Iraq  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=662) and Persia and also there were Barbers  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=665) were really Tigers uh like power power  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=667) Indian tigers no not not not the bats  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=670) they were there and even levels were  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=673) there so there's no connection but  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=675) through the community there or there's a  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=676) community various Community they're  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=677) separated by long distances so Community  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=679) or something like that anyway they have  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=682) also features they have certain certain  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=684) instinctive and possibly certain  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=686) injunction we don't know how what level  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=688) of of responsibility injection they have  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=691) there are some Hadith which hence that  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=693) someone could say it is metaphorical for  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=696) the exactness and the conclusiveness of  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=698) accounting like for example all our  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=702) scores in the Dunya will be settled even  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=705) the the uh the the sheep or the goat  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=710) which has no horn being honed or being  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=712) headbutted by another Hornet he will  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=716) have a retribution  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=717) he will have a distribution  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=719) but all narration indicate that the  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=722) Beast all of the beasts with few  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=723) exceptions will turn into dust so the  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=725) accounting will be just setting the  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=727) account between themselves do they have  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=728) certain is the Instinct enough  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=730) responsibility so that the account to  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=732) that ground do they have enough  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=733) distinction distinction of right and  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=735) wrong in this limited sense that uh  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=738) a goat which has massive massive horns  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=741) recognize that it should not be  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=743) head-butting a horn uh got on the same  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=746) species which doesn't have uh maybe by  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=749) Instinct and if it does nevertheless so  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=751) it has like a minimal free will we don't  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=753) know but if that Hadith is at face and  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=755) not metaphorical many people say it's  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=758) metaphorical the settling of account is  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=760) so extreme and so exactly that even if  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=763) goats would be resurrected this would be  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=765) settled that's one possible anyway  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=767) there's a hint here that there may be  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=769) somehow uh will be gathered to the Lord  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=772) the Gathering to the Lord does not mean  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=773) that will be resurrected careful  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=775) Gathering is something different that  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=776) migrants affected because after the  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=778) selection there may be Agame after  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=780) Gathering memory Resurrection Maybe not  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=781) maybe they gather through the load and  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=783) then he declares him you did your path  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=785) in the universe now just be erased from  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=789) history or something else we don't know  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=791) but there are some kind of community  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=793) with certain structure and so on which  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=794) have similar to the human community and  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=796) the human Gatherings and so on  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=798) and everything is under under record by  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=800) Alpha that's the most important point  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=801) with the ISS smartphones we have not  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=805) neglected anything in the book  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=807) that's a metaphorical nothing is  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=809) escaping Allah's knowledge everything is  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=811) recorded Allah  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=813) so if you think  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=814) God's sake look at the ant colony  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=819) and ant colony we may have easily  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=821) Millions I think and there are big  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=822) colonies which stretch somewhere into  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=824) billions  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=825) so we have all over the world maybe  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=827) trillions of ants  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=829) doesn't seem to be possible to keep  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=831) track of that  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=832) no no  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=834) every one of them has kept track of  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=836) don't worry every one of them  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=839) and even there may be in other planets  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=842) similar cliche like ants most likely  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=844) similar there will be some there will  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=845) always will be somehow similar other  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=847) Christian there there may be other ants  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=849) in another galaxy  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=851) trillions of them and another there who  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=854) is able to keep track of that  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=856) nothing is be is off record everything  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=859) is on record so don't don't worry about  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=861) that all is all record  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=863) there's a nice note about that but ant  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=865) colonies and there's a Hadith  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=867) related to that nothing is upside from  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=870) Allah's knowledge  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=874) is it a profit settled down in you know  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=877) in a battle Cambrian or that travel  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=879) campaign and there are three to have an  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=881) app  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=882) but they don't notice that there's an  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=884) ant colony nearby  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=886) so when Aunt beat him  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=888) so he woke up obviously upset he said  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=898) maybe another one  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=900) and so many prophets we have no record  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=902) whatsoever  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=903) and then he was so angry he ordered the  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=905) whole and couldn't be bad  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=907) Allah shaded him see because one ant bit  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=912) you you exterminated the complete colony  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=914) of ants complete nation of ants who are  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=917) busy glorifying me  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=920) if you must take revenge it should have  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=922) been one hand  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=924) but the one who bought it with you  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=926) that's all that's only one bit don't  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=928) kill one one for one one for a colony  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=931) which kind of excesses that it was  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=934) a lot of what was going on what was  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=937) happening all of that happening I said  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=938) no don't think it's not that well only  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=940) the materialists who think is only an  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=942) issue with a dead blind and so on I  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=944) think everything is in vain I think  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=945) would inspired whether it's no it's not  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=948) a little bit for what foreign  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=971) they say because he sees what happened  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=973) to the animal that they attend us so who  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=975) should be like the animals maybe we  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=977) don't know there's nothing really  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=978) compelling so that we make it parts of  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=980) Akita no but they are gathered to the  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=983) Lord for whatever purpose  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=984) a type of gathering it means  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=989) so they would be gathered today a lot  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=993) foreign  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1018) something like that  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1020) uh and that one obviously you cannot  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1022) have a distribution because you cannot  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1024) control injuries to the other this way  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1025) if it's just a facial injury you may  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1027) resist to aim to be surface the injured  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1029) but if it goes deep that is not  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1031) controllable so you have just to get  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1033) happy with the financial conversation  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1035) and things like that so movement is the  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1038) one here which hits the head that set  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1040) away  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1041) so this is  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1045) and the other aspects is most of it is  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1048) metaphysical we don't know what this  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1049) Gathering is all about and also the  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1051) north Divine knowledge is obviously  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1052) something which is not accessible to our  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1054) immediate uh  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1056) perception or even imagination how it  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1059) appear so comprehensive and enormous  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1066) um  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1072) translate and they who give the light to  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1075) our messages are deaf and dumb in  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1078) darkness deep who whomever God Wills he  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1081) let's go astray and whomever he Wills  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1084) he places upon a straight path next  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1086) translation those who reject our  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1087) messages are dumb are deaf dumb and deep  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1090) in darkness whomever God Wills he lets  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1093) go astray and who remember whomever he  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1095) Wills he places upon a straight path  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1097) yeah so they the the what's wrong says  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1101) especially in going astray they they  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1103) admitted the right things say let him go  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1106) astray or the Quran say he whoever Allah  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1109) he will go astray say it as willing  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1112) there is willing not saying but  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1113) everything to go astray but that's the  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1115) correct meaning that translation is  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1116) correct  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1117) definitely correctly because of the  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1119) evidences of the Quran but you find many  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1121) even  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1123) most other breeder from from some  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1126) so-called Sunnah persuasion mostly and  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1128) madhali and wahhabi and so on they think  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1130) SRI Allah will someone to go astray in  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1132) the same that winning to do an act not  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1135) permitting him to go astray according to  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1136) his own reason and because they don't  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1138) read the rest of the Quran and they  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1140) don't have a clear idea about the Qatar  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1142) and they are wavering they go sometimes  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1143) to extreme right except  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1145) left and they never find any way because  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1149) they do not read they read the Quran  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1152) without digesting it and that's that's  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1155) what made them  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1157) so that's also secondary that's a  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1159) mistake of the scholars so all of this  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1161) is it I'm reading the Quran without  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1163) digesting it is a disease of also most  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1166) human beings but if it has become so  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1167) fundamental that such issues are not  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1169) digested properly then you become halaji  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1172) minor issues everyone will have that we  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1175) will not nobody would be able to they  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1177) just solve the Quran no doubt the depth  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1180) of it and the various layers of meaning  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1182) did we discuss at the beginning the  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1184) Hadith ruled that the Quran is having an  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1187) affair of meaning a deep meaning or  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1188) button to several depths to Seven Levels  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1191) so we didn't discuss it  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1193) you have discussed our questions  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1195) and so on so  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1200) the best Scholars they may got most of  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1204) their and maybe one button what about  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1207) the other buttons total depth  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1210) so we'll not be able to digest  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1212) everything but at least just the most  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1214) fundamental things the most important  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1215) things  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1217) then  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1218) if you don't adjust that  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1220) by well that happened by by taking this  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1223) eye out of the out of this context but  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1225) also not available  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1251) this is an interesting subject so if you  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1254) look at how schools developed  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1256) when you've got the hanafi school then  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1258) the Reliance on righty and then if you  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1261) look at the nudgley school and it's it's  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1262) it's unlikely to be a coincidence in  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1265) terms of  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1265) how they have a very regimented approach  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1268) and because they don't have the  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1270) conceptual depth they always used to  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1272) rebuke The Other Side by saying that  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1274) they're just using Russian and all that  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1277) kind of stuff is it it's not  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1278) coincidental that the the level of depth  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1281) that you get from the nudge the wahhabi  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1283) school is is that superficial uh it's  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1286) it's fantastic I saw a video recently  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1288) just a couple of days ago when when  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1291) uh Egyptian someone asked him uh what's  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1296) about the Earth is it a flat Orca or or  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1298) around say you should ask only about  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1301) things to benefit you  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1303) and then he mentioned various elements  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1305) say  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1305) always available of the saying that  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1308) there is is quite as wood-shaped or  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1311) egg-shaped all what they have is of NASA  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1313) and the picture is that an authority  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1316) should we live if we take a Quran for  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1318) there and they mentioned the various  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1320) straightforward eyes which they invoke  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1322) which is completely miseried  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1326) like for example image of the following  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1327) uh let's mention that quickly because  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1329) maybe some of these uh we call them  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1331) obviously  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1334) Russia  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1340) um  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1342) I didn't understand you said what you  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1344) call them  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1346) someone laying flat to say yeah just to  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1349) promote them okay  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1352) you said you faster to the land  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1358) anyway he mentioned Russia the famous  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1362) one is  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1369) equivalent to being flat no salt has the  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1372) surface everything has a surface your  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1374) body has a surface if I say look at this  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1376) Man how he is selfish how the skin fits  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1379) on his body in this way  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1381) you you may you you make sense of that's  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1384) a question because we don't think about  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1386) that because everyone is have skin snack  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1387) but there's a certain diseases where the  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1389) skin separate from the body and start  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1391) hanging then you can say look how this  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1394) has been surfaced  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1395) it's an odd disease but that's another  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1398) set of physique and a pathological  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1400) surfacing so that's that's one and  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1402) there's another recording for Zakir Naik  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1404) the the Indian diary although he comes  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1407) from like like I had it back around it  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1409) because he is a medical doctor  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1410) originally and has some brain the man so  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1413) he mentioned the eye of uh attending the  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1416) day around the night and night as my  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1418) necessity it must be and also the issue  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1420) that he and he entered the night in the  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1422) day bit by bit ulich and the opposite it  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1425) can be impossible for Flat Earth so  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1427) sorry  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1428) about this  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1432) is actually the Egg of the ostrich which  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1435) is exactly similar to the Airship is  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1436) that if it's exaggerated obviously so  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1438) you can see it but this  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1440) so this donkey and says we're not going  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1443) to take the pictures and what NASA and  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1445) the other civilian Authority completely  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1448) Undead these people are completely dead  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1449) completely brain dead  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1453) because that happens when you divide the  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1456) Quran section and read one Ayah without  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1458) reading the other Ayah without comparing  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1460) with all other eyes to the Quran and you  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1462) should do it deliberately Allah said to  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1464) construct a possible contradiction so  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1466) that the world is not from Allah and  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1468) he's challenging you you will not find  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1469) that you will not fight any country but  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1471) by doing this when I convention to what  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1474) your imagination to what we will say in  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1476) the street no to another Ayah or can I  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1479) develop and yeah but this comes from  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1482) reading a Quran  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1483) with a sealed heart a  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1487) residents  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1492) management they manage the economics  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1494) managing the Quran if you manage a book  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1496) meaning you work with it  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1499) you put it together you sort of explain  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1500) this with this that's management I  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1502) really think it's just nice voices maybe  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1504) you can you can sing it very nicely  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1506) that's not a double the double  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1512) they decided and then even he mentioned  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1514) after they say and some of the sellers  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1516) declared whatever say the essence is is  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1518) a ball as a kaffir and insult to injury  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1521) make himself an utter utter disgrace  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1524) I couldn't comment on that video except  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1525) saying really you are a donkey that's  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1527) all right I couldn't say I think  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1529) it was  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1533) so let's go back to our issues so that's  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1535) that's uh that's  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1537) translator luckily have passed that  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1541) stage in the issue of valara because  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1543) obviously it's as impossible for Allah  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1545) to to will someone to go astray no he  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1548) ever met him but it says the reason and  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1551) rest of the Quran but the same actually  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1559) because it's a bonus he may help in that  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1563) enlightened open his mind for more  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1565) things that's perfectly fine there's no  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1566) ingested there but fundamentally he has  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1570) to do the first step then Allah will add  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1573) bonus in the case of the Lara he never  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1575) had anything  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1576) but here here is also allowed to  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1579) um  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1582) he will permit him to be on on that  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1585) right path because he started the job  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1587) and did that did the work  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1589) and then he can add more that is  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1593) like a Highway uh uh a big Highway with  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1598) many lanes you just get into  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1601) we are left arriving in English or to  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1603) the left lane with a slower speed Allah  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1604) can step in and give you  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1606) boost so you can go to the right more  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1608) right lens for Speedy and speedier more  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1610) guidance more speed but you are already  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1611) in the late you enter the name you enter  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1614) the highway first do that then I will  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1616) give you a boost to to go from the left  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1619) lane to the more right lanes with higher  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1621) speed  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1623) that's the way it works  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1624) so  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1625) but these people most people who are  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1628) stuck in Java and so on there and you  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1629) saying  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1631) because they they are Blended but they  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1634) did not even read the eyes of example in  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1636) and Surah the or Samsung  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1640) about the sword honestly  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1643) he inspired them with their old soul  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1646) with his with its translation and with  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1648) righteousness  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1650) I mean it's capable of both as I mean  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1652) you could have free will for both and  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1654) then the next exercise  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1655) successful would be the one who purify  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1658) himself now attribute amplification to  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1660) the man himself  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1662) we should be must be a correct as  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1664) tribulation because too far enough being  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1665) as we discussed many times  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1670) the other metaphorical meaning must must  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1672) be clear from the context so he's the  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1675) one who does the purification  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1688) to synchronize her soul and self down  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1690) instead of purifying he he is staying it  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1693) with Phil said  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1695) Philippines the action filthy thoughts  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1697) full theater or another also no thinking  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1700) no working nothing just say I don't want  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1701) to know about I'm just busy now making  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1703) money and stability that's that's what  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1706) it makes you filthy make your mind and  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1708) your heart filthy and get you doubt for  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1709) example  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1711) but we discussed in many cases but this  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1712) is what the example so that's the  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1714) question so the translator at least for  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1715) the first one they did it with that and  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1717) the other one they say that made it  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1718) attributed to the Divine because they  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1720) felt  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1721) somehow but they could have also  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1724) well a lot instead of saying  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1728) Allah allows him to be understood also  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1731) but later on after being on the set path  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1734) as I said giving the metaphor of the  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1736) highway with many lanes  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1738) he entered the highway when you enter  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1739) the highway where you enter and then if  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1741) the Indian land for example left left  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1743) driving country and they left mostly  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1745) because the other slow speed  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1747) now would be able to accelerate and  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1749) compete with the others and go to higher  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1750) lanes and have higher speed that in that  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1753) case Allah may have an input  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1755) directly or miraculously  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1757) sometimes even through the system  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1759) because the moment you get on the right  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1762) path the conditions around you  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1765) with some effort on your side I'll make  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1768) it right for you to have it to uh to  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1771) accelerate and so on you are already in  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1773) the in in the right in the right path on  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1776) the highway all it's just getting better  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1778) and better and better  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1779) in that case either way we're on doing  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1781) or are not doing so through the system  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1783) of the universal the system is so tuned  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1785) that in that case you can improve  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1789) by the design facility where you are  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1790) encouraged to improving Etc or by direct  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1793) action of Allah by Visions by dreams you  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1796) have no no hand in them which strengthen  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1798) you and Faith get you further and so on  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1801) good  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1803) I think I think we discussed harder many  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1805) times and discussed it because of the  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1806) realization question before you continue  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1808) um so I've got one question in relation  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1809) to the story of the answer  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1812) well uh bear with me there may be some  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1815) follow-on questions you may have from  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1816) this uh can we take hukum from the  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1819) stories of the animals and the past  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1821) Nations  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1822) depends on how the prophets have  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1824) mentioned it clearly he mentioned that  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1825) in in in in context that that uh that it  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1830) is it is uh worthy of shedding at least  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1833) of prohibition to destroy the untimes uh  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1836) especially with fire he said there are  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1838) many commands that the fire should not  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1840) be used to kill or destroy anything  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1842) secondly in retribution you should not  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1845) go excessive but establish that so the  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1846) stories enforce that and give you like a  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1848) visual like a drama which makes things  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1851) more more suitable closer to the heart  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1855) so we can't take okay it's that guidance  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1857) but that's that's not because it's a  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1859) previous Nation it's not that Authority  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1861) in itself  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1862) it may be an obligated Sharia yeah  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1866) that's a general question but there are  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1867) there must be some hints  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1869) there must be some hence there which you  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1871) have to guide you to think about the  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1873) mother and look for further evidence and  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1874) see what's happening and things like  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1876) that  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1878) good yeah  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1880) but they directly take home directly in  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1882) that sense form it's like this no that  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1884) would be not the correct way well I want  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1886) to always say that for the for for the  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1888) for for the sharing out of this prophet  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1892) he he he he stepped over over the bomb  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1897) and he committed that which is possibly  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1899) Hala which means the action of prophets  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1901) and so on are known to say and father  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1902) but unless we have extra evidence that's  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1904) you can take that in that because it's  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1906) about a statement of the fact what's the  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1908) nature of the universe only his  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1910) reporting from Allah which has leave no  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1912) doubt that is he reporting from Allah is  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1914) that valuable one anything else as long  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1915) as he's a prophet anything else because  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1917) we come and sort of to the one who who  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1920) is who jumped out of prophet and became  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1923) a shaytan I will come to that inshallah  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1926) but as long as I saw a prophet and we  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1928) read the story in the Old Testament  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1929) until the last moment when he failed  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1932) and sunk down he was truthful  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1935) but his action became miserable and then  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1937) that action was set so so grave that it  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1940) pulled him down and he lost forth  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1943) and then he will follow the shepherd and  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1945) became satanic then you cannot trust  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1946) anything chemical him neither words nor  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1948) anything  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1949) you can argue this way it needs it is  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1952) more of analytical things yeah  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1956) good  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1958) it is  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1959) no you cannot generally take a no no  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1962) evidences in a sense of sharia  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1964) injunction but but you can't take hints  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1967) and then you look for other evidences  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1968) then and most likely the stories  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1971) especially in the Quran the main  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1972) features there are very clear what they  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1975) entail what they mean although mostly is  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1978) forever and take lessons rather than  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1980) take Sherry eye Junction  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1983) like for example when Yusuf received  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1985) then the message of the king say come to  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1987) the king he said no I'm going to come  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1989) until I'm exonerated let's go back to  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1992) your lord and ask him another as I was  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1994) praising this I'd say if I were in the  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1996) place of Joseph and the messenger came  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=1998) to me I would have one right away he's  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2000) praising Joseph it's this high rank it's  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2002) very difficult to achieve after so many  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2004) years in prison they can't say come  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2007) yeah you are your your you you are  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2009) released say no no I'm not going to come  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2011) first settle the court case check this  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2014) woman what they said is it true or not  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2016) clean my clean my my the record  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2019) completely I'm not going just bye bye  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2020) bye Royal Grace or just uh but no  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2023) on my ground that too and the kingdom  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2026) was held a court of law and the woman  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2029) admitted that that they fabricated and  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2032) so on so  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2034) and they will have  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2035) regretfully etc etc and then based on  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2038) that then Yusuf came after that  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2040) extermination he got a report everything  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2042) has been settled the king is absolutely  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2044) convinced  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2046) that this woman have light under the  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2048) fabricated stories this committed  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2050) perjury so the initial order to detain  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2054) you like any good law system is null and  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2056) void any issue as if you've never been  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2059) enacted we are sorry come now  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2061) I came in all honors but I love it too  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2063) is that also to praise Yusuf and put him  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2065) in a high rank and Automotive I think he  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2069) would have done better than Yusuf but  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2070) anyway he said if I were in the place of  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2072) Yusuf and the messenger of the king came  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2074) saying get out because I've gotten out  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2076) right away  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2078) okay so we can take from this set and  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2080) things certain hint set and uh issues  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2083) which is of issues of Aesthetics issues  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2085) of preferability and so on thus  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2087) appraising of the act of Yusuf and  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2089) definitely this is the show this is  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2091) highly desirable it's not obligatory  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2093) because he said I would have done it but  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2096) he said I would have done it and then  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2098) argue in the court case later that's no  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2099) problem but you should say no no I'm not  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2101) even going to step from the door until  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2103) this metal is settled I refuse to get  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2105) out I remember also certain cases I  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2107) don't know if there's some activities in  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2109) Saudi Arabia they will say you can't go  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2111) out now since I'm not going out open the  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2113) door instead he sat in and could listen  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2115) listen this is settled  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2117) something that happens so we have people  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2119) who who can get up to the level of user  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2122) Frank yeah so the message would have  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2124) been higher than that anyway but because  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2125) of modesty was to give us the hints what  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2128) should be done what could be done the  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2130) story is like that so with the Jews from  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2131) that something like that  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2133) from the comment of the Prophet not from  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2135) the story as mentioned in the Quran as  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2137) it is this is history  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2140) but it's clear what is it there for  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2142) example so from these stories we can  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2144) take head of certain things and analyze  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2146) but it needs sometimes a little bit  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2148) deeper look than than uh than the  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2151) shallow way of most uh foreign  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2167) flag there's some problem there not only  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2170) it's not only the whole I should be  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2171) mentioned maybe the whole context from  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2173) the beginning like today we started from  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2175) a new context about every bear that  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2177) animals are nations and so on this seems  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2179) to be relatively simulated context from  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2182) the previous one all this connected in a  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2184) deep sense but in method of legalistic  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2186) and and philosophical aspect is can't be  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2189) regarded as a Blockbuster if you don't  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2191) if he doesn't take the whole block from  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2193) beginning to end he will and then in  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2195) catastrophic results and that's helping  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2197) history look for example usually when  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2199) the invoke the will come to that  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2201) inshallah in due course the so-called  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2203) the Ayah of the sword in Surat uh  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2222) is even worse than that  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2225) if you read that  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2227) and there's other enemies of Islam take  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2228) that or something you can say oh they  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2230) called to kill everyone yes  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2232) that's catastrophic because you're free  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2235) the whole context we change the whole  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2237) story and the whole legal aspects  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2239) completely  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2250) from that  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2252) so  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2253) that could be catastrophic  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2255) genuinely catastrophic  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2258) and there in that ironic discussion I  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2261) didn't discuss only that either with the  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2262) context but all the various eyes and  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2263) bakara later Ayah right left under those  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2267) had made fighting conditioned on people  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2270) committing aggression against us that's  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2272) the specification the specific cannot be  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2275) obligated by The General  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2278) by the absolute it's not impossible even  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2280) if that one is later  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2282) but the one at the solar test  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2286) does it it is even it's not General but  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2290) even if you play General it gives you  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2291) only the club  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2293) it will mean go back to what I told you  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2295) what to do with the machine right all  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2297) you do so start the fight  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2299) that's still the Restriction is still  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2301) valid until today until tomorrow until I  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2303) see you until until I tell you fight  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2305) anyone even if they won't fight you it  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2307) must be specified like that to remove  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2309) the Restriction there's no it can be  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2312) abrogated that is a restriction or a  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2314) specification without another  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2316) specification negating that clearly and  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2318) outside just a general does not forget  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2320) that  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2323) foreign  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2334) and even in important things like war  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2337) and bees and and the fundamental things  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2339) about this belief and belief not only  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2341) that only that one context but other  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2343) other context which will like this one  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2345) if we see this he misguided anyone who  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2348) wants but to at least I look at  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2350) Solitaire  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2352) no no it is not the meaning is allow him  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2355) to go astray because if Allah does not  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2357) allow you to go astray or to be guided  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2359) you will never be able to achieve  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2361) anything unless permission must be so  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2362) that your will can work but the allowing  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2365) will be essentially allow you to choose  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2368) whatever you want to choose  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2370) this must be that long because if it  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2372) allows you only to choose guidance you  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2375) can't choose otherwise if it allows you  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2376) only to go astray you will go straight  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2378) there's no way so it will be the  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2380) fundamental point is that all these  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2383) actual humans who and other people who  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2386) are less sufficiently Free Will and so  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2388) on which which are a matter of the  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2390) subjects of accounting and  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2392) responsibility  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2393) the the the entity the finite into the  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2396) limited entity cannot perform it with  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2397) with its free will generally free will  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2400) even it's a limited one except by Allah  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2402) allowing them to choose whatever they  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2405) choose not allow them to make a certain  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2406) Choice otherwise it will be forcing you  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2409) to assess your choice because nothing  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2410) can happen the University of permission  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2412) so he he permits  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2415) let let that person choose whatever he  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2417) wants  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2419) done it can materialize otherwise we'll  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2422) never be materializing ever  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2426) ever because of the overwhelming  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2428) absolute dominance and control the  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2430) railways  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2432) okay so keep that hold that to your iron  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2435) fist  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2436) s  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2438) um  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2449) this one  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2451) say can you see yourselves invoking any  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2454) but God when God's chastisement befalls  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2457) of you in this world or the last hour  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2459) comes upon you tell me this if you are  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2461) men of Truth in Translation can you see  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2464) yourselves invoking any blood God when  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2466) God's punishment falls on you in this  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2468) world or when the last hour comes upon  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2470) you if you are truthful  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2472) and and that's that's that's a clear in  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2475) all nation in all situation even we we  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2478) have atheists for example in a big  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2479) Calamity like a car rolling over or  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2481) something like that if you can hear what  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2483) they're screaming some some people  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2484) survive or sometimes it's recorded  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2487) nowadays some people having own recorder  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2489) so you see them say oh God oh God oh God  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2493) foreign  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2505) even Hindus they will call just God  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2509) bhagwan without mentioning any space he  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2511) got one so it's a blim one  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2515) my Lord something like that  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2519) meaning the Supreme ones the mysterious  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2521) one  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2522) that would identify now or something  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2525) like the secret forced in the universe  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2526) or something like that in the moment of  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2527) distress and even the biggest desert  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2529) will be if they say if the hour comes  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2531) hour comes most likely will be such a  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2533) major event uh usually I somehow I I  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2537) cannot really get out of my mind that  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2539) maybe like an extra I throw it striking  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2541) the Earth  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2543) imagine a story striking death and you  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2546) say boom and you hear that no it will  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2548) happen only a few minutes before the  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2550) tidal wave comes and finishes everything  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2552) off  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2554) like the poor dinosaurs have that it  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2556) happened also before that I think at the  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2558) end of the permium and that one is in in  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2560) the Indian Ocean the one of the  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2561) dinosaurs is in Mexico they have they  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2564) have very good reasons to believe that's  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2566) over there and there are places of the  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2568) of the asteroid that would be the SA  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2573) help stood it it's gone  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2576) but in reality the only action will be  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2578) like that so next time  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2587) alone that you will evoke whereupon he  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2590) may if he so Wills remove that ill which  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2592) caused you to call unto him and you will  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2595) have forgotten all that to which you now  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2597) ascribe Divinity side by side with him  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2599) the translation no it is him alone that  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2603) you would call if it were his will he  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2605) may remove whatever harm that caused you  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2608) to call on him and you would have  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2609) forgotten all that you now associate  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2611) with him yeah so that new quality that's  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2614) your code and then he may kindly respond  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2618) but by by  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2622) by granting that what you want sometimes  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2625) he does no difference  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2628) but before before that  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2632) other list I think he can very well  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2634) accept on this one if he was insha  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2637) depending upon the machine and the  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2639) condition at that moment and the system  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2640) in the universe and the visit Tessa or  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2643) not and so on and in any case you will  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2644) forget what what you have a shared you  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2647) will always think about the Supreme  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2650) deity if you have various deities or  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2652) about the the force the secret force in  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2655) the universe which they call brahmana  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2657) not Brahma Brahma Vishnu Shiva no these  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2661) are three I could emerged from this  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2663) brahmana the secret force in the  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2665) universe this void is something  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2668) which has no structures but so most  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2672) likely the Hindus you say you say in the  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2675) movies when Calamity or bhagwan  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2678) oh my God  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2680) for example in I saw various various  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2684) things I said a woman is  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2689) respected up my respected Lord without  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2692) mentioning any name so it's the one in  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2694) the mind the Supreme one the one they  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2695) point to the finger sometimes that's the  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2697) one even there although they have tons  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2700) of Idols family Idols Village Idols this  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2702) Idol but ultimate it will be this one  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2704) that was a supreme one the one who's not  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2707) giving a name just sub G or bug one  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2710) check I've got a question on this so  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2713) is this alluding to it's an automatic  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2715) response or is it  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2719) that's a subconscious working that's the  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2721) mind working  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2723) if you say some mind working is it  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2725) almost in a sense that the person  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2727) subconsciously  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2729) has happened yeah this is what they call  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2731) the God complex  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2732) okay okay so well that would indicate  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2734) that it's an automatic response rather  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2735) than something conceptual because what I  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2737) mean to make a distinction if someone  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2739) this is not the time to think which one  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2742) I'm calling which one will be able to  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2743) just the Supreme one will do it that's  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2745) Allah  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2747) is this a thought out thing or is it  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2750) something that's as interesting then  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2752) then we have to accept guys psychiatrist  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2755) and kill yourself and so on but that's  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2758) what happened or could we see it they  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2760) may be exceptional people of extreme  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2762) stubbornness who refused to uh  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2765) to acknowledge it as a God or something  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2767) like that but that's usually not in a  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2769) Calamity like for example uh the famous  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2771) actor Henry Fonda I think he was an  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2773) atheist Church  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2776) even after his deathbed they say just to  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2779) him too to get a priest and have  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2780) sacraments he refused stability  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2783) because he knows that this is inevitable  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2786) and it cannot be prevented and delayed  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2789) and he refused her to believe her and  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2791) got generally God or whatever I don't  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2793) know his detail I don't know a family of  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2795) his life but it's definitely important  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2797) that he refused strictly don't bring any  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2799) priests in his story whatever reason I  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2800) don't know  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2802) so there's something else but in a  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2803) Calamity like falling or or a firestorm  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2806) or the nuclear explosion in good  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2808) forbidden Central London and we see the  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2810) fireball advancing there's nothing else  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2814) yeah look at that like that or a car  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2817) starting to turn over  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2820) or a plane obviously the pilot tell you  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2822) sorry we lost we lost we lost all the  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2824) engines we will try to somehow to land  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2827) on and if we wind up as a water so the  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2829) landing will be soft up then you know  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2831) it's gone  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2843) take it simple as that going on the  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2846) depth of psychology and the God complex  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2848) the brain and you can excited electrical  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2850) leave that for the theater session  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2852) but clearly is that what what experience  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2854) shown and especially in the Arabs  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2856) because the Arabs their shark is  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2857) relatively late the northern Arab the  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2860) shark is relatively late and imported so  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2863) uh became like like a shared or is a  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2866) share called City copper but a layer  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2868) over the fundamental way they're still  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2870) the major deity the central Advantage  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2872) there  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2874) mentioned various places when they are  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2876) in in at Sea and the storm comes then  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2881) Allah  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2883) because it's the only one who can manage  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2884) this bad situation at one side maybe  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2887) other God can help in some issues  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2889) getting a Camelback sorry with that see  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2892) only the big one can do the big work  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2895) in that sense in a more simple-minded  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2897) way okay so let's assemble by the level  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2900) and then you can go to higher level into  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2902) into psychology and the God complex in  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2904) the brain and how it is implemented in  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2906) the genes we can't go all of these  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2908) levels that may be part of that water  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2910) the larger muscle would say is this is  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2913) but at first is that what the alarms you  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2915) and this is pretty many to the Arabs but  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2918) we see it applies to other nations also  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2920) probably today even extreme uh Pagan  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2925) like like Hindus still there is some  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2928) kind of central mysterious force or  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2931) something Supreme thinks something  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2932) somewhere which was only invoked in the  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2935) major calamities or the State of Shock  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2939) yeah  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2941) okay agreed  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2943) so it has various levels  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2945) and most likely it is the reaction and  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2947) invoking the major deity or the major  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2949) force in the universe or something like  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2951) that is is  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2953) not based up because in such a major  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2956) Calamity like like you're seeing the  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2958) fireball advancing view of a nuclear  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2960) explosion or the ship is about to sink  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2962) and so on there's no time to analyze  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2964) which one God will be suitable for that  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2966) you know what by by instinct  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2969) it must be the major deity if any and  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2972) even some atheists may may even  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2973) distorted that oh God help me or  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2976) something like that  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2977) even all the thin layer layer of atheism  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2980) just evil bodies  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2983) good well  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2987) um  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2993) this is him alone that you will invoke  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2995) whereupon he may if he so Wills remove  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=2998) that ill  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3001) yeah next one  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3003) and indeed we sent our messages on to  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3006) people before thy time a prophet and  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3007) visited them with Misfortune and  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3009) hardship so that they might humble  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3010) themselves this translation we sent our  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3013) messages unto people before your time  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3015) profit and Afflicted the people with  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3017) Misfortune and hardship so that they  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3019) might humble themselves yeah that's this  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3021) is their General habit that most humans  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3024) will be will live will reject the  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3027) message is because of arrogance and  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3029) stubbornness and feeling that they are  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3031) powerful and capable so visiting them  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3034) with with the hardship and like the  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3036) people foreign  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3052) and should be persuasive in itself but  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3054) they refuse to to submit to that and  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3056) also foreign  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3063) which would have done in any value and  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3066) that's the sultan which is he feels that  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3068) nobody knows about the people were  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3070) wondering what's happening why not oh  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3072) they have to be executed right away in  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3074) reality that's Sultan that that Horror  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3077) in his heart when he sees Musa is is  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3079) only known to him obviously you read  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3082) sometimes in some of that that he was so  
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3085) terrified from Musa that he was even not  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3087) controlling his urine who is this as  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3088) some kind of exaggeration people imagine  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3090) things and that the stories I'm not sex  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3093) is impossible and even they say he was  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3096) urinating like a donkey anyway  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3099) will invent such a stories but clearly  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3103) he was he was so intimidated that he is  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3104) unable to give any comment  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3106) and that's it that's responsible from  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3108) that he said well we're afraid that we  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3110) don't want to open our mouth he will  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3112) immediately order us to executed  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3115) I said no no I will make an I will give  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3117) you an authority over him and I'm  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3118) listening with you  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3120) Allah telling them go don't worry that  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3123) will not happen so this is where Allah  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3125) is stepping in miraculously and for all  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3126) I felt that in himself he should  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3128) recognize that but that did not help so  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3130) all the other Miracles after that are  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3132) all really connected within investor  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3136) visiting them with hardship with  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3138) suffering and so on frogs uh floods and  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3143) the last one that the death of all first  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3145) born or most of us born are catastrophic  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3148) things  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3150) and the purpose of that is that here is  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3152) a powerful entity which can harm you or  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3154) put you down by by material Force  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3157) but  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3159) you have to put yourself down by your  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3161) own choice  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3164) you have to do it there's no way to do  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3166) it the universe is not structured  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3167) otherwise it doesn't work this way  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3171) so that you have to make a choice  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3175) unfortunately from day one because  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3177) created without any real will or the  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3179) will only for the good and the father  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3180) but no that's not the joy but there is  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3182) that so all of this external hardship to  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3185) push you down materially so that you  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3188) push yourself down  
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3190) uh spiritually and submit to Allah ask  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3195) for Relief please remove that we  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3198) acknowledge that we that your other  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3199) ultimate sovereign  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3210) wanted not to  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3213) unfortunately unfortunately  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3217) so so so stubbornness and then her  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3220) heart-heartedness can get to that level  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3221) that is  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3232) one second  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3238) yet when Misfortune decreed by us befell  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3240) them they did not humble themselves  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3242) rather their hearts grew hard for Satan  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3244) had made all their doing sing goodly to  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3246) them in Translation when The Misfortune  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3250) fell on them they did not humble  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3251) themselves but instead their hearts  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3254) became hardened and Satan made their bad  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3256) Deeds alluring two of them to them  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3258) exactly and as we see in history  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3260) essentially rarely any  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3263) Any Nation just came to their senses by  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3265) themselves except the people of of Jonas  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3272) for some reason we don't have the taste  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3275) in the Quran  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3276) but they when when units left  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3280) and then According to some narrative I  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3281) don't know if it's not from the prophet  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3282) or from the from the stories of the Old  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3284) Testament I don't know I didn't check it  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3286) I don't bother checking it they have  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3288) been engulfed by some kind of a folk or  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3291) smoke  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3296) nowadays obviously this is a civilized  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3299) area and people are sophisticated and  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3302) Heritage civilization Russia and they  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3304) recognize this must be because Eunice  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3306) was angry and left now the punishment is  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3309) coming and they came to the sense and  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3310) they asked a lot to to relieve  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3313) remove that and there will be believer  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3315) and ask him to return units to them and  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3317) that has happened that's the only  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3318) exception of what I mentioned even  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3320) Muhammad  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3322) the majority of quraishi did not until  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3324) the sword took them until they were  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3325) defeated in in in the caucus of Mecca  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3329) and more but some of them even embraced  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3332) Islam as monafithi  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3334) it didn't help  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3337) so that's that's and that's all because  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3340) their heart became hot they could they  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3343) were able to uh and and their misdeed a  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3347) piece of them reasonable we are the  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3349) reasonable to be able this Prophet or  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3350) they say is what is bringing is  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3351) unreasonably not acceptable  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3353) he is the for example the case of people  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3355) following said this is a slave Nation we  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3357) are supposed to be give them leadership  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3359) and made  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3361) regard them as equal and we have a  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3363) civilization going for thousands of  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3365) years at times already that the pyramids  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3367) have been standing there for maybe a  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3369) thousand thousand and a half years  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3371) because if Musa is 1450 before Christ  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3373) say 1500 the pyramids at three thousand  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3376) plus so we are talking about almost two  
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3378) thousand years before ancient generation  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3381) for Generation we have this order and  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3383) then a couple of guys with the slave  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3385) Nation are going to change our way of  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3387) life completely upside down  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3390) that's that's the that's not that's not  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3393) the way most likely the scholar said  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3394) that's not the way your social  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3395) engineering should be done this should  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3397) be done bit by bit to stay in my stages  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3399) nicely on what like the psychologist now  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3401) say by enacting law after law maybe over  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3404) 500 years not excitedly no this doesn't  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3406) work this way his God must be must be  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3409) mental who asked her to do that suddenly  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3411) no it's not right that's the way you  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3412) will persuade yourself through something  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3413) all these things may be a good a good  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3415) thing but it can't be that immediately  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3417) like that no no that's not acceptable  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3418) and the other one say no no until I said  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3421) I'm not going through to give up  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3423) Divinity and absolute sovereignty no no  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3425) no before someone in heaven I don't know  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3427) and the one in heaven is not even  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3429) talking to me he's talking through the  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3430) slave no no  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3432) and even worse talking through a man who  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3435) doesn't even express him say Well he has  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3436) a problem in his tongue he has to tell  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3439) his brother and his brother explain what  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3440) he wants  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3441) people come on be sensible how we can  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3444) follow this that's the way they thought  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3447) they developed it in such a way that it  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3449) looks  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3450) it looks Washington  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3452) they will make it to their evil forces  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3455) on himself as an entity or the shaytan  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3458) could mean that the evil force of the  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3459) evil inclination the gaps in the in the  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3462) gaps in in the in the structure of the  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3464) mind and the structure of the heart  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3466) that's the shaytan  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3469) accommodating for him  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3471) two thousand years ago even more of this  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3474) realization development was supposed to  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3476) change in one day yeah you catchy it's  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3478) easy change your attitude and rework  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3481) things around it it will work in a few  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3483) days and months it will work no problem  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3485) all that you need to change that here  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3487) inside your inside your heart and bread  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3489) nobody said to demolish the building  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3491) nobody said to anything  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3493) even Idols for the Majesty's artifact  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3496) and an historical artifact that's it  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3499) it's easier than people think  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3502) what are the philosophers and social uh  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3505) professors will come with all kind of  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3507) philosophical developments no no no it's  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3508) not the way it develops history  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3510) development doesn't develop this way I'm  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3512) using the model language or recent  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3514) language must have been something else  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3519) yeah and the same as well same with the  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3520) Qureshi  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3523) we are the guardian of the sanctuary we  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3526) we are the best in Arabia we are the  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3528) banking of Arabia we are the leader of  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3530) Arabia  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3532) and this guy is coming to tell us that  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3534) our way of life is because we have some  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3537) some symbolic Idols that's not the way  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3539) to go  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3543) and most likely that's because he  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3544) advised for power because many Hashem  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3546) are weakening now and losing power so he  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3548) started to establish power faking this  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3550) well we'll give you this analysis  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3552) there's a better analysis than believing  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3554) that receiving something from heaven and  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3556) things like that all kind of arguments  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3557) suitable to the current situation of the  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3559) time  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3565) foreign  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3576) closer and then when they had forgotten  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3580) all that they had been told to take to  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3582) heart we threw open to them the gates of  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3584) all good things until even as they were  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3587) rejoicing in what they had been granted  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3589) we suddenly took them to task and load  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3592) they were broken in spirit next  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3594) translation  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3595) well they had forgotten all that they  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3597) had been told to take to heart we opened  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3600) the gates to everything they wanted then  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3602) as they rejoiced in what had been  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3604) granted we struck them suddenly and they  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3606) were held and they were in despair yeah  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3608) after the peso of tribulation and they  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3611) said then my for example hardship like  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3613) Noreen like in the case of Yusuf and so  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3615) on  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3618) oh this is actually how the world Works  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3621) farming's exchange with rain time and so  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3623) on that's that's what what what have  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3625) been visited on us is actually the  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3628) normal cause of things it goes in Cycles  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3631) it is in Cycles now the cycle is gone  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3634) now we aren't fine and nice if  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3636) everything is fine no problem so don't  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3639) don't bother very much about thinking  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3641) whatever this profit or this this  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3643) message you have sold you with us is all  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3644) from God he's Imagining the guy is the  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3646) poor guy is misguided he's mentally  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3648) dressed it just happened accidentally to  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3650) be in a time which is a type of Pharmacy  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3652) the rain is being held by the Lord from  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3654) you ah it's not it's just just cycles of  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3657) weather of changes and so on nowadays  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3659) say the jits today was going south and  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3661) more than  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3662) about him and then maybe Good Times come  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3665) and the people forget about that and  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3666) then suddenly academic comes which is  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3668) finishing them where they are then in a  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3670) State of Shock a little bit unto it  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3673) that's the way it works in the universe  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3675) which people may call it cycle  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3677) but some of his man-made Cycles when  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3679) someone is divinely made sex or  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3681) somebody's psychics in the world because  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3682) the days over and the world dictates up  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3684) and down the Quran says that it's where  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3686) but in that case with case of a  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3687) messenger and so on don't assume it is  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3689) just a normal cause of things it may be  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3692) not you should think about it  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3699) so if they've taken that suddenly so  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3702) they are in a state of shotgun Mobley  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3703) soon you don't know what to do with  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3705) Community because  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3710) it has happened several times in history  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3712) like the people of nowhere the people of  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3715) of  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3716) uh  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3718) of hood Etc  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3720) uh the people of Saudi they have come  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3723) through these stages and the end stage  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3725) was that everything is fine they tell  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3726) them come on  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3728) let your lord bring that what he has  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3730) been threatening or love because  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3731) especially important people of wood it  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3733) was a long time of knowing and famine  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3736) and he's warning them and so on to bring  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3738) you all kind of we don't know which  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3740) evidence because the colanders it's  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3742) interestingly it doesn't mention any  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3743) specific Miracle robot  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3746) he must have something else we don't  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3747) know we don't know anyway  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3749) then ultimately  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3751) I didn't start it will come and so on  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3753) and then increase  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3755) and then they saw this huge Cloud coming  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3758) converter that's no that's that's a  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3760) cloud which will really refill the wells  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3762) and the Earth will be wet  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3765) and all the time of the hardship family  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3767) will be over and that cloud is that what  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3769) was really super hurricane or super  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3772) typhoon this is the Indian Ocean they  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3774) call them typhoon or a cyclone Super  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3777) Cyclone because in the India also they  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3779) called Cyclone I think in the Pacific  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3781) they are called typhoons and in the in  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3783) the Caribbean they are called hurricanes  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3784) so that must have been a super  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3790) Cyclone which exterminated them  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3795) so it can happen like that and luckily  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3797) after Musa and harun this this this this  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3800) system has been changed underneath the  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3803) taking over and the extermination is  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3805) taken by the hand of the Believers in  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3806) the battlefield against rustaman hostile  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3809) murder cover what would this happen to  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3812) the party for the quality  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3814) they were cut in pieces by with by with  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3816) an ultimately defeated in the Corpus  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3818) actually the conquest of Mecca because  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3819) of Allah's mercy and the things have  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3822) this enacted even the time of Abraham is  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3825) a place of security what the the  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3827) Bloodshed was minimal only few suffered  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3829) and the rest just corroded there in  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3831) their houses and some became one African  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3833) became believer and converted and so on  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3835) but generally in other nations the the  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3839) believing Nation  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3840) which the messenger immigrated to will  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3844) be in case of Visa  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3846) he was lifted up before that but was  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3848) already announced in the Old Testament  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3849) so since most had agreement this this  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3851) system uh has been changed or was  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3853) mentioned in in other occasions which  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3856) will come to that I'll translate this  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3858) now yeah and in the end The Last Remnant  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3861) of those folk who had been bent on evil  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3863) doing was wiped out  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3865) for all praise is due to God the same  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3868) the sustainer of all the worlds next  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3870) translation  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3871) the evil doers will wiped out all  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3873) Praises do to God the lord of the worlds  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3876) is  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3877) just Lord could be a sustainer could be  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3880) a lawmaker and it's both  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3882) so that's that's the Lord is the correct  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3884) one another because translation as Lord  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3887) is the better one than sister  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3890) because  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3897) Translate  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3902) say what do you think if God should take  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3905) away your hearing and your sight and  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3907) seal your hearts what deity but God is  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3910) there that could bring it all back to  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3911) you  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3912) behold how many facets we give to our  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3915) messages and yet they turn away in  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3917) disdain yeah next translation  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3919) say consider this what  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3922) a lot of his friends are considered this  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3924) what if God should take away your  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3926) hearing and your sight and your and seal  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3929) your hearts  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3930) what God other than God is there that  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3933) could bring it all back to you  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3935) see how we explain our revelations in  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3937) many ways and yet still they turn away  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3940) in disdain okay not certainly clear but  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3942) I just have one one important comment  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3944) obviously when you say which God beside  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3947) God so that one is a smaller cabinet is  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3949) better so we should deity inside God  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3951) will come to the jewel inside Allah  
[1:05:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3953) that's okay  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3954) now this  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3957) just refused completely what our happy  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3959) Claim about that that God is something  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3961) which is worshiped he's not they're not  
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3962) talking about worship or submission  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3963) anything at all it is which deity will  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3966) bring you beside Allah except Allah will  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3969) bring you back the site and the and the  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3972) open the hearts and open your ears after  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3976) that taken by Allah the same same let's  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3978) assume Allah blind you yeah  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3981) and make you make a deaf  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3985) leave the heart because that's intent  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3987) about this externally  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3988) that happened from Allah which of your  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3991) deities is capable of reversing it  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3994) which meaning that the definition of  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3996) deity is an entity which can reverse  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=3998) that or can do that can take it away and  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4000) bring it back  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4003) as intrinsically has this capability  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4006) thus alone shows that the definition of  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4008) is something which worship is faulty  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4011) under but that the people did not read  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4012) the Quran from begin to end  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4014) they have a fixed idea  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4017) starting with the mistake of intimia  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4018) with blunder actually but they sharpened  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4021) it until it became the energy  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4022) devastating  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4024) a devastating uh it was like a blunt  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4027) Hammer used sparingly a little bit but  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4030) the sharp knitted became that assault  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4031) used everywhere to cut everything into  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4033) pieces  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4034) so this is when one characteristic idea  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4036) that he can't do that  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4038) if they would was worshiping these these  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4041) idols and so on just just as that hobby  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4043) think they are just touching and kissing  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4045) them I love you and so on and that's it  
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4047) then the argument would make no sense  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4052) they they must have been believing and  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4055) they think that they could do something  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4056) like that or the other branch of deity  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4059) the secondary branch is that they  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4061) descend at the offsprings over that  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4062) another Duty so they have the honor or  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4064) the genes or the genealogy of deity  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4066) leave this aside you could say these do  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4069) not have enough Authority but usually  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4071) even those because the Beloved girls  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4072) daughters and sons of Allah must have  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4074) set in power another thing can't be just  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4077) just plainly just being nice Divine and  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4079) they will have some a King's Children  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4082) even if they are not participating in  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4083) the government they still have the  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4085) respectability and something to say and  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4087) they can advise and direct them so they  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4089) can do something  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4090) definitely  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4092) by virtual being of divine origin  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4094) especially in time past when the king is  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4096) really absolute and also the offsprings  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4098) are also have some kind of absolute  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4099) power but the exercises with the  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4101) limitation of their father Yes but they  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4102) are so  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4105) so the claim that uh deity meaning  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4108) something which is worship does not make  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4110) any sense because they told him no we  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4112) never say that they have discoverability  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4114) that's not our gods are not of this side  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4116) this type no no the gods of this type  
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4119) either of divine origin or independently  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4122) capable of creating and blinding and  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4124) taking up giving them outside back Etc  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4128) that's exactly what and it was a famous  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4130) story that when one of the sahabi early  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4132) Muslims she had some some eye problem  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4136) and uh she became blind whatever you  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4139) know maybe it's a temporal problem  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4141) anyway but that's what the report says  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4143) she became  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4145) we warned you Allah will take your love  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4148) with your eye aware away I said by Allah  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4152) Allah I said away or bring it back it's  
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4155) Allah who took it for whatever reason  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4157) and he is the one will be able to and  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4159) the report said she'll get again  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4161) someone could say this is a placebo  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4163) effect because she's very very confident  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4166) I believe yes but but this is the  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4168) reality a lot kind of bring us because  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4170) Allah doesn't exist it does not have  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4171) that's supposed to be the the consort a  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4174) life of Allah Allah being accepted about  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4176) this nonsense I cannot do anything it's  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4178) just it's just a name you have created  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4180) in your mind doesn't exist so she  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4182) couldn't have been possibly taken my  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4183) eyesight or back and maybe he has things  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4185) of Faith or a miracle from Allah  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4191) so let's say this means genuine they  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4194) believe that Allah can do that  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4197) that's good but that's what's making a  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4199) Divine being all this is that Allah is  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4201) actually from a satanic origin not from  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4203) because uh kalash was the belief that  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4207) the ability is two branches the good one  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4210) Allah and the bad one the evil one is  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4212) everything so they have this dualism  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4213) which is called zandaka and uh and then  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4217) after that long ages of War peace was  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4221) settled and then a lot which is a  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4224) according to also the old babylonic  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4226) beliefs is is a under underworld goddess  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4228) was sent to heaven to become the wife of  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4230) Allah so that no peace and settled the  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4233) same way King settled disputes in the  
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4235) Dunya just marry your daughter to the  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4237) skin and things get settled nicely  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4241) so that's what they were believing but  
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4243) they are Divine beings worship not  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4245) worshiped irrelevant  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4247) Divine being of good time bad time but  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4250) Divine big  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4251) worship yeah worship would be based on  
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4254) that automatically it's clear  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4256) it's clear but that's that's that's  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4258) that's that's that's by as it stands see  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4261) the adity is the one who can take sight  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4263) and give sight creating the abilities  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4265) and he's telling them which deity of  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4267) your deities claim deities can retain  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4269) the eyesight  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4271) when if Allah has taken the eyesight  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4272) away tell me which one none and the  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4275) story of that woman is an example of  
[1:11:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4276) that and many other examples is there is  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4278) no way  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4279) and also in normal life people go blind  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4282) to get diseases get their leg cut in an  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4284) accident and so on any one of these they  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4287) can carry attend that back show me  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4289) has never happened  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4291) have ever ever happened  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4294) never ever  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4297) so they take a take from that is that  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4299) this shows what what the meaning of  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4301) illah in the in the context of the Quran  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4304) at the time maybe the word Eli in  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4306) ancient time had another meaning  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4307) actually  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4308) in the time of Musa and in Old Kanai  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4312) language is almost  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4315) and that's the reason Old Testament to  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4317) say it says in the discussion in  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4321) in more cine assuming it is it's true  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4324) there's no reason to believe it's  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4325) fabricated  
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4326) he said I will be your Musa and you I  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4330) will give you your brother alone to be  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4332) with you but he will under you I will be  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4334) your illah and you will be meaning the  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4336) Lord or Master leader  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4339) at the time he did not have that meaning  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4341) it was developed further but over the  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4343) time and Allah was given them the  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4344) constructed name yehovah I think at this  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4347) what is Jehovah means I think I think it  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4349) is meaning essential it is a sentence it  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4352) is not abbreviation  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4353) as they liked it it looks like but so  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4355) many he who is he  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4358) he who is he no that is then there is a  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4360) city existing that's translated in  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4362) symbol common my language at that time  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4364) things like necessarily existing and and  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4367) contingent were not developed yet that  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4369) discussion so the best what you can  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4371) describe that is he who is he  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4375) when I when I asked how much does the  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4377) people who is the one sending me because  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4378) we will have so many gods and so on God  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4380) of ram I'm on which one what's your name  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4383) I should tell say and in your previous  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4386) generation Abraham and after they called  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4388) me illah should die the strong Lord the  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4392) strongest one the structure one but now  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4395) we'll have advanced in history obviously  
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4397) if they ask yourself he who is he send  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4400) me  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4402) later on than the word ill was was made  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4405) and made with the article  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4408) the god  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4410) and then merge together  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4412) Allah and then we no need for that so  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4416) then the Quran  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4418) anyway let's say we just say Allah told  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4420) him  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4423) I am Allah that's after all these  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4426) development and the linguistic  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4427) development there's now a name no need  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4429) to use Jehovah anymore we have than a  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4431) personal name for Allah Allah  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4434) but this is what originally at that time  
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4436) was constructed as a sentence  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4439) and so that's in time passed and then  
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4441) became then with this definition with  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4443) the Quran clarify with this various  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4444) question and the most clear definition  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4446) and sharpness is the insert the momentum  
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4448) welcome one day inshallah the Ayah of  
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4450) so-called  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4451) Mutual Mutual exclusion that Allah no  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4457) Offspring wallet  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4461) would have taken their the creation and  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4464) went away or they could try to overcome  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4466) each other so that's a deity is either  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4468) of spring over deity  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4470) or something intrinsically capable of  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4473) creating and having his own career on  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4474) his own power on his own sign his own  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4477) will and take it away or defeat the  
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4479) others overcome them  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4481) try to defend that's that's that that's  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4483) that's all types of deities which exist  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4485) genuinely  
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4487) in a precise form which people simple  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4490) people like simple hinders so don't have  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4492) a clear picture in their mind but like  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4494) like something uh amorphous something  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4498) nebulous in their mind but it was to do  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4501) three things either of spring of a deity  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4503) or a deity in that definition which is  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4505) capable acting well with intrinsic power  
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4509) and absolute superiority  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4512) and this definition is perfect it's like  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4514) if you remember the people who had  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4515) programming they have so-called  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4516) recursive definition  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4518) because you say it's either offswing a  
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4521) deity  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4522) or the deity with this characteristic so  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4524) if similarity is a deity it may be  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4527) assuming another option at ultimately  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4528) ends to the fundamental one which is the  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4530) one which I think in Sovereign intrinsic  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4533) power and three words  
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4536) and this is examined with applying to  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4538) taking eyesight blinding and things like  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4540) that  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4541) nothing with worship or neurotype but  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4543) worshiper here no worshiper is available  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4544) it's an intrinsic attributes of a  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4547) divinity  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4550) okay clear so that's that's one that's  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4552) that's one part of the just for for  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4555) these uh  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4557) blinded heretical Hobby and the  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4559) definition of divinity  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4561) because of the definition then you have  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4563) something called grave worship  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4565) initially  
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4567) because people go to the game and touch  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4569) it and kiss it and it became a deity  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4571) that no that's impossible it can't be  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4573) but there's no great worship  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4575) that's not good  
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4577) one quick one there I just I missed this  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4579) one somebody's asked  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4580) um the issue of the shape of the earth  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4581) what about geocentricism versus  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4585) heliocentrism acute crane hmar on the  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4588) former  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4591) they said the same pencil the Quran are  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4593) there also  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4595) these things are these things are  
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4598) in the Quran hence set and things  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4601) sometimes same thing  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4602) and sometimes it is uh like for example  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4606) they usually invoke that the the sun is  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4608) running to to a place of settlement and  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4612) the killing settlements under the throne  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4613) and all this thing we'll discuss that in  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4615) some recessions which will come but that  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4617) running through a place of settlement  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4618) cannot be the the apparent motion around  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4621) death because it never settles out a  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4623) matter of fact and this Hadith under the  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4625) throne is most likely fabricated but  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4627) even if it is must be metaphorical so  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4629) because we know by this is the Earth is  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4632) is egg-shaped and and by the Quran and  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4635) by the by the observation by ancestral  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4637) perception then there will be no Citrus  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4639) so the sun in the sense of being under  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4641) the throne prostrating is continuously  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4644) at one point of the earth any time in  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4646) any time on on in in that passage of  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4650) time there's a place on the Earth where  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4651) the sun is like in the deer in the  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4653) bottom so it blows it under the throne  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4655) meaning under Allah's control fine  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4657) so this is this is destination which is  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4660) cities but this destination is  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4661) continuously she is always settling  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4662) somewhere so that meaning  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4665) is running to a place of settlement  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4668) cannot be the meaning of that so maybe  
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4670) it's movement  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4671) so not the apparent movement let's say  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4673) so the apart movies is really apparent  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4675) but leave that the sun moves also around  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4679) the center of the Galaxy actually it  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4680) moves relative to the local globe of  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4682) that that's a certain movement then the  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4685) whole block local block moves around the  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4687) center of the Galaxy there's another  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4689) movement  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4690) etc etc  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4691) so that's that's the so you have to take  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4694) all these evidences and to to get to  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4696) this thing my advice don't integrate  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4698) involved in that leave it to the people  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4700) of Science and so on simply because it  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4702) needs to take various evidences and  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4704) analyze which reference frame we are  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4706) looking from if you are looking Forum of  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4708) the Earth  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4709) then obviously the whole heaven and sky  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4711) is the  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4712) socospherical astronomy work with that  
[1:18:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4714) at the end as if the Earth is is is not  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4718) rotating and the whole sky is rotate and  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4720) they do the geometry and the calculation  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4722) it works the same way  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4724) is it real or is it the sky the Earth is  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4727) rotating and the sky is actually not  
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4728) rotating it relative to the air in any  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4730) great extent there may be some Far Away  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4732) rotation that somebody but let's say go  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4734) the nearby area  
[1:18:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4735) that's what's well established for  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4737) various reasons because various  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4739) observations show that and various  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4741) places uh between winter and summer  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4743) various it should actually show that it  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4745) cannot be that that uh that uh the sky  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4748) is rotating actually we are rotating  
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4750) let's just say an apartheid movement but  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4752) in astronomy and aesthetical astronomy  
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4753) it doesn't make any difference in the  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4755) same geometry can be applied  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4757) secondly issues related that if it's so  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4760) then the remotes the remote starts  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4762) because they rotate to the same angular  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4763) speed they must be there their their  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4766) their physical the tangential speed must  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4769) be enormous  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4770) which is impossible because we know  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4772) there's a limit of speeds which is the  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4774) speed of light so they must exceed the  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4776) space like that a reality but that's  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4778) impossible so it must be only apparent  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4780) this is your matricat by by refusing the  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4783) reference frame so this thing is better  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4784) left to the specialist Bush will Design  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4787) the reference frames and work on it and  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4789) so on  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4790) probably  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4792) so just so that's it this is no problem  
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4794) with that there's absolutely no problem  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4796) it can be worked out in detail but it  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4798) needs some some kind of graphic  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4799) representation some kind of maybe  
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4801) representation Now by by uh by Holograms  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4804) and things like that so it can be easily  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4806) appreciated  
[1:20:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4807) and everywhere look to the reference  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4810) frame  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4811) reactive to whom you are talking  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4814) to the one who is talking to the Center  
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4817) of the Earth or to the center of the Sun  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4819) or the central of the solar system which  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4821) is different than the central Sun a  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4822) little bit or the center of the Galaxy  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4824) or if there's any Center of areas or the  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4827) points of the big bank which we don't  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4828) know where it is now at the moment  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4831) you see so there's there's many issues  
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4833) there related to the reference frame and  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4835) we delete the issues of Relativity is  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4837) absolute not absolute and so on deep  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4839) issues and the hints of the Quran held  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4841) many of these issues  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4843) good  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4846) but that's an issue by said it may be  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4847) worth maybe one day addressing it but I  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4849) think I don't think it's worth  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4850) addressing because all of these which  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4852) come with that it must be flat because  
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4854) of his eyes as I mentioned that example  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4856) is just after stupidity they don't even  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4857) have the basic linguistic understanding  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4859) of the medical difference between plane  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4862) and surface a surface service for  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4865) anybody has its own self a sphere has a  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4867) surface which is the external Shield uh  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4870) uh a cube has a surface which is this  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4873) how much one two three four six sides  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4875) this is the surface and internet and so  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4878) on so that when a foreign says look at  
[1:21:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4881) this house has been uh  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4884) selfish how the self is shaped  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4888) look at some more things have been made  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4890) up right or stuck up right is used for  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4894) them for the tent yeah  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4896) the tent is is made upright by an  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4899) internal pillar clear the mountain is  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4901) not of this type but also we say the  
[1:21:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4903) banner is upright  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4905) there's a both famous box world  
[1:21:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4909) of the banner  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4911) that by a by a pillar and the LIE is to  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4914) the side it's not like the tent another  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4917) type of nurse the mountain is being must  
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4920) be made not being said like that by some  
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4923) other mechanism so what's the meaning  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4924) look how it is being us what is the way  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4926) of nasu the the the type of nose what's  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4929) the type let's mean assembly look at the  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4932) mountains study its shape that's  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4933) geography  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4935) do measurements the co-dc  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4938) but you have to dig insight to see  
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4939) what's going on for God's sake do  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4941) geology meaning addressee  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4945) study these Sciences don't be idiots  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4947) that's it  
[1:22:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4949) not that it is like the tent or like the  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4952) like like the like the the the the the  
[1:22:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4955) the pillar of a panel this is to another  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4958) type we must  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4965) the how is not clearly visible  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4967) don't say don't you see like that but  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4970) meaning it  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4971) now we see they're standing there but we  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4972) don't know how it is okay so go ahead  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4974) study it  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4975) don't remain like animals and donkeys  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4977) animals cannot study you can study go  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4979) ahead and study go to geography  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4982) geophysics your chemistry and geology  
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4987) the same days have been however there  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4988) have been surfaced look at the surface  
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4990) how it's cheap how it's related to  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4992) technology movements plate movements and  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4994) so on  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4995) again start geography study study  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=4998) tectonic strategiology  
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5001) but instead of doing that they say oh  
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5004) it's actually flat  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5006) flat brains or no brains in the first  
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5009) place  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5011) see my point  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5012) so it directs you to look and do not do  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5014) knowledge and do science  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5018) and the same with other things  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5021) in time past some people started like  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5023) this  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5025) even there's a reading from it is  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5031) she doesn't settle anywhere  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5033) and this is a permissible reading  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5035) because adding an alif the Quran shows  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5037) that they're adding alif is permissible  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5039) in certain places  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5042) this addition may be maybe a possible  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5044) reading  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5045) and it's from Prince Road by the way  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5047) from  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5049) salafi they will get stuck obviously  
[1:24:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5051) because somehow having wings and become  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5054) angels and know everything but  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5057) I I wouldn't adopt that that one I mean  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5059) I think the meaning is that but maybe  
[1:24:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5060) that's intended because adding an  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5062) elephant so in the Quran is well  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5063) established everywhere so this is one  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5065) way the rasm of the Quran can be  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5066) extended by adding alifs and Hamza these  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5070) four can be added in appropriate place  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5072) you can't add this anywhere let's see  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5073) does it make new sense yeah in this year  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5075) makes sense  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5077) is running with no place of rest  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5083) and then all the issues about where it  
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5085) is and so prosthetic under the Irish is  
[1:24:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5088) gone for example so you have to have to  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5090) have to do a little bit more hard work  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5092) in these things  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5094) then that's just the shallow uh this uh  
[1:24:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5096) shallow idiots of Egypt I saw recently  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5098) says uh some declarative fear anyways to  
[1:25:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5101) claiming the S is not flat  
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5104) just plain  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5106) I've been couldn't find any committee  
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5108) such as indeed you are a donkey  
[1:25:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5111) say the words I couldn't what I'm  
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5114) supposed to say  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5115) the comment there in YouTube recommended  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5118) cannot go Pages explain all what they're  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5120) saying now so the only things that you  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5122) are indeed a donkey that's all that  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5124) sorry I can't say anything more than  
[1:25:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5125) that or something like that  
[1:25:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5128) very unfortunate  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5132) good  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5134) so I think we can maybe see if we can  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5136) finish this block of context let me see  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5139) what's today  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5145) another challenge which other deity can  
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5148) do something else let us see  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5150) [Music]  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5152) if we have this taking the eyesight and  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5154) so on and then they turn away from the  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5156) ayat and the next  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5158) attack oh  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5163) hello  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5165) yeah let's continue with the same  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5169) can you imagine what your condition will  
[1:26:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5171) be if God's chastisement befalls you  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5173) either suddenly or in again gradually  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5176) perceptible manner but then will any but  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5179) evil doing folk ever be destroyed next  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5182) translation say consider this what if  
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5185) the punishment of God should come to you  
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5186) suddenly or gradually would anyone but  
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5189) the evil do as be destroyed yeah  
[1:26:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5191) according to previous energy obviously  
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5193) uh it will come through the tablets it  
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5196) doesn't have a doculation that sadly  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5198) came like that uh it came on the hand of  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5201) the believer when they when they  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5202) defeated them in butter and other  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5204) battles and then ultimately in  
[1:26:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5205) conquering Mecca then some who was  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5208) taught to the sword were exterminated  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5209) and some ran away and the rest coronated  
[1:26:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5212) their houses  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5213) so they were defeated and to survived  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5215) because they didn't report the sword  
[1:26:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5217) like Abu Sofia and others and some of  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5219) them became hypocrite for their life but  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5221) some became the believer and recognized  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5223) that this proves with this attitude that  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5226) this man is a messenger and we have been  
[1:27:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5228) wrong and Alpha and uh and and and  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5232) foreign  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5251) with my sword  
[1:27:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5253) and then later on in Madina he told the  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5255) people some of your mercurysm people  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5257) because some people objected that that  
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5259) abubakaran were receiving Bilal and the  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5261) other slaves the glory be what exactly  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5263) are people from the law class people and  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5266) they say they are not giving us a face  
[1:27:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5267) as we deserve and you told them Listen  
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5269) People  
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5270) and the others they accelerated to Islam  
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5273) where do you stand back you are the  
[1:27:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5275) reason for your low class now if you  
[1:27:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5278) want to catch with them up  
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5280) show your Iman and go to now say I'm not  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5283) just saying that I am doing it I am  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5285) going to go to Sham and pass away in the  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5286) battle and I think he was murdered in  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5288) any artwork that's the way things said  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5290) that's the way to get honor you don't  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5292) get honored by by complaining about  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5294) Bilal and others being admitted for us  
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5296) in the audience with Abu Bakr because  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5298) they were fast you are in detail stay in  
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5301) detail as you would if you want to come  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5302) forward do something to show Allah that  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5305) you are worthy I am going to go and go  
[1:28:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5307) for Jihad and he went he packed his  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5309) luggage went and was murdered in shop  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5311) that's the same for Halloween  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5313) so we can't conclude with almost  
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5315) attitude Allah that is a True Believer  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5318) why the opposite Allah  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5321) for example  
[1:28:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5324) Etc  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5326) but they were they saw that and still  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5328) even perseverance seeing that he thought  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5330) oh that is just the way that they are  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5332) knighted and because there's a Sofia  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5334) most likely believed in in the two  
[1:28:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5335) deities believing in a good evil and God  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5338) oh yes the the force of evil or the  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5341) force of good has this time succeeded  
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5343) next time the possible evil this is back  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5344) and forth it will go like that  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5347) and he said another occasion I have I  
[1:29:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5349) don't know about Hellfire on Paradise  
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5351) but we'll have another asthma with  
[1:29:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5353) electricity but this is an opportunity  
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5355) to to play with with the government with  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5358) the with the rule with the rulership  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5360) like playing with it with a ball  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5362) everyone I throw the ball to you you  
[1:29:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5363) throw it to me and we play ball with it  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5365) that's it forget about Jannah and none  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5368) of that existed  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5369) so we have it that's exam we have this  
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5371) example  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5372) although he saw  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5373) the demise of the Quran standing on the  
[1:29:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5377) kingdom but it didn't it didn't help  
[1:29:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5380) and some so but concerning the previous  
[1:29:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5383) Nation when the Allah's punishment came  
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5384) especially if it is a the physical  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5386) punishment the one the Believers have  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5389) been always saved taken out out of the  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5391) Hill the people of wood they left the  
[1:29:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5393) the place before the the Cyclone hit the  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5398) people of sarda he told them you will  
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5400) enjoy your life for three days and they  
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5402) will be extremulated and he left with  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5403) his own people and they were excavated  
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5405) and they was laughing at mocking after  
[1:30:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5407) the three days  
[1:30:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5409) the earthquake was wasability with  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5412) lightning I think it's talking about  
[1:30:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5413) destroying them and so on and the same  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5416) with the people of of uh of madian etc  
[1:30:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5419) etc  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5422) so that is how it works and even if it  
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5425) works in a more Gentle Way like after  
[1:30:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5427) Musa essentially it became gentler it's  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5430) usually in the hand of the believer in  
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5432) the battlefield so that there will be  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5433) remaining people enough people who may  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5435) benefit and take hit  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5437) which is amazing for my kind actually  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5439) this videos are banished in the hand of  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5441) the Hostile one the belligerent one the  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5443) one who oppressed and kill and and maim  
[1:30:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5447) they are fought by the Believers thus  
[1:30:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5449) usually will never be an extermination  
[1:30:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5451) War  
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5452) that the chiefs of coverage eliminated  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5456) possibly most of them and some of their  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5459) armies are destroyed and the rest would  
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5461) May majority of them may come to their  
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5463) sets let's say merciful models what they  
[1:31:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5465) had it's no more volcanoes hurricanes  
[1:31:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5468) and things like that finishing the job  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5470) that's a mercy after the time of Musa  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5472) essentially said that's the way it is  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5475) being done  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5478) okay I think this after that it starts  
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5480) essentially a new context so let us let  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5482) us stop here and catch also  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5490) [Music]  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5494) on you uh  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5498) so first of all uh let me start with the  
[1:31:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5502) the Ayah that you just finished uh uh uh  
[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5506) you know the the people of uh previous  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5508) uh prophets uh the Believers of them  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5511) Allah had saved but he exterminated the  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5515) those who who did not believe right  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5517) generally before yeah exactly but I  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5520) think uh this treatment is is only for  
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5524) for the uh for those people uh of the  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5528) previous prophets because in general I  
[1:32:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5530) mean nowadays we see that uh any type of  
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5533) uh of natural uh catastrophe you know  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5537) you can call it uh uh you can call it  
[1:32:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5541) like earthquakes or volcano eruptions  
[1:32:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5543) you know we see that it takes all all  
[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5547) people bad or good so okay I see what  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5550) you're assuming let me just quickly get  
[1:32:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5553) at some points of these first of all  
[1:32:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5555) these National academies which had  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5558) and they have two-sided because they are  
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5561) not in response to denying a messenger  
[1:32:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5563) which are present that's that's gone the  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5565) last messenger Muhammad is gone after  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5566) that no one who claimed to be a  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5568) messenger of any respectability has come  
[1:32:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5570) and with those who have come have been  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5571) explored as Liars we know that for a  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5573) fact  
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5574) yeah agreed now now these calamities  
[1:32:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5579) of national academies they are then a  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5583) punishment for the disbeliever and the  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5585) mercy and murdered for the Believers so  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5586) Allah made them like that so but because  
[1:33:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5588) that system of the universe because you  
[1:33:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5590) are living an area which is unstable  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5593) because two plates are one place is  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5596) going under another place like andarada  
[1:33:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5597) Himalayan like in in West Iran or  
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5601) Northwest Iran like in Turkey and so on  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5603) this will go on and off over and over  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5605) and over it does not it may be  
[1:33:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5607) punishment for some people and mess with  
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5608) other people that's the General  
[1:33:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5610) Adaptation but also the interesting  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5613) Hadith is that about the plague  
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5616) originally the first time the plague hit  
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5618) Earth was a punishment for certain  
[1:33:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5620) people  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5621) possibly an ancient prostitution out of  
[1:33:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5623) a recording history maybe in the Far  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5625) East because simply plague has imagined  
[1:33:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5626) in China and the Far East  
[1:33:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5631) then after that it stayed in Earth  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5633) meaning it's encirculating going here  
[1:33:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5636) appearing coming inside  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5637) Allah made it after that  
[1:34:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5640) a punishment and done your punishment  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5642) for the disbeliever and the murderer  
[1:34:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5645) because it has staying Earth is a  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5647) bacteria it's a one type of bacillus I  
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5651) don't know  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5652) whatever what type of bacteria it is and  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5656) it is now circulating it hides sometimes  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5659) in in rodents and come again and back  
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5661) and forth and still somewhere hidden in  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5664) some places and erupts inside if the  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5666) conditions are right now with the vagina  
[1:34:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5667) hygiene is less dangerous less there and  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5670) also with antibiotics the danger is less  
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5672) but still it may erupt one day  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5675) since that's not the initial of the  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5676) universe the bacterium it has to stay  
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5678) and survive  
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5681) it would hit some people  
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5683) on some places the clinical objective  
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5686) conditions then it will be in that  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5688) context when it happens of a punishment  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5690) for the disbelievers  
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5693) by making a bonus for the believer it is  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5695) that I murdered them for the Believers  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5698) it's not just a normal death it's a  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5700) mercedon for the Believers  
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5702) which becomes like a reward for the  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5704) Believers  
[1:35:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5705) so things were became well balanced yeah  
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5707) is that what you mean that's it but  
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5709) there was all it is National event and  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5711) so on like for example if you remember  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5712) in with the famous tsunami in was 2004  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5716) .  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5719) and some people speculating how could  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5722) God allowed I said are these people are  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5724) just the people are stuck with the same  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5726) problem of the and that's usually you  
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5728) find these claims coming from so-called  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5730) Christian side because  
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5731) their definition of the deity is faulty  
[1:35:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5734) they say there's extreme goodness  
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5736) because they have to persuade something  
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5738) like that to justify that he sacrificed  
[1:35:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5740) his own son for the people sin which is  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5743) nonsense  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5744) that's not that's all these nonsense  
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5745) that's not that's not uh that's not the  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5748) way uh The Divide attributes are and not  
[1:35:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5751) the way they open University structured  
[1:35:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5753) that's a doctor if if I could just add  
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5755) one more thing please before going to  
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5757) the second point so uh so Allah also for  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5760) the previous Nations the previous  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5761) nations of the prophets Allah I think  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5764) what I believe is that Allah had saved  
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5766) the Believers so they can become the  
[1:36:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5768) eyewitnesses of what happened to those  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5771) who got exterminated so this so by being  
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5775) eyewitnesses they could they could till  
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5777) the next Generations see the see those  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5780) who disbelieved uh don't be like them or  
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5782) other otherwise that's one of it was one  
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5785) of the benefits of it but it's just a  
[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5787) punishment by itself but they be they  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5788) believe that the Believers are safe  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5790) because that punishment Was Won by a  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5792) prophet that you will be destroyed and  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5794) the believer will be saved so Allah has  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5796) to fulfill his purpose that's the  
[1:36:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5797) fundamental point that there will be  
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5798) eyewitnesses they report further that's  
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5800) all okay that's all extras hey things  
[1:36:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5803) and investors do not have one word  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5804) they're very complex and very interwoven  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5806) yeah that's true yes okay excellent  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5809) excellent uh second point please is that  
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5812) you know you touched up on the  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5813) abrogation and you were talking about  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5816) the eye of Sword and the error committed  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5818) by Imam Shafi  
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5821) exactly I I also read this in in in in  
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5824) your last research the citizenship  
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5828) that's by the way that's just a casual a  
[1:37:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5831) casual mentioning the whole research  
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5832) yeah several things will come out so  
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5835) wait for it okay okay got it I I haven't  
[1:37:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5838) read there's the whole research by the  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5840) way but no it's not out yet the big one  
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5842) is is coming out that's that's  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5844) theoretically for this issue I mentioned  
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5846) that casually there in the issue of  
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5847) citization  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5851) is sufficient Enough by itself but the  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5854) other one is completely comprehensive  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5856) including you are studying all the  
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5858) confrontation between the sahaba and  
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5860) Persia and roma and show that there it  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5862) is really not an offensive Jihad in the  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5865) sense  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5869) is ultimately a defensive  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5871) yes I just want to focus on on  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5873) abrogation itself you know because uh  
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5875) Imam Sharif he says that the or or  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5878) people like him Scholars like him they  
[1:38:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5880) say that the latter can abrogate the  
[1:38:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5883) former and I don't know performer the  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5886) point is that the latter usually  
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5887) obligated from it but the general will  
[1:38:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5890) never abrogate the the expression and  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5893) the absolute the the absolute will never  
[1:38:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5895) obligate the restricted warmer or not  
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5898) formal but if it's like for example uh  
[1:38:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5901) facing facing vital mark this  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5904) was obligated by facing Mecca  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5906) that's a specific specific on Facebook  
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5913) so that's the application but you take a  
[1:38:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5916) look in a matter of abrogation and  
[1:38:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5918) general and special in in the in the  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5920) appendix to the constitution of uh uh uh  
[1:38:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5923) uh Islamic renewal party yeah and then  
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5926) the appendix about concluding and  
[1:38:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5928) deriving have you seen that it is  
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5930) available in uh yes  
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5934) yes I read it  
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5941) issue in various obligations various  
[1:39:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5943) restrictions  
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5944) yes but this is this is because of the  
[1:39:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5947) logical problem there  
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5949) is that he he did not they did not say  
[1:39:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5953) he did not  
[1:39:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5954) clearly so uh  
[1:39:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5957) he did not establish this principle in  
[1:39:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5959) all colority  
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5961) in all clarity  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5963) um in some places he applies it some he  
[1:39:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5965) doesn't apply it is not consistent  
[1:39:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5968) yes I see actually doctor I just want to  
[1:39:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5971) make the make the last point is you see  
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5973) these these fine details uh even a  
[1:39:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5977) modern Judiciary systems they they  
[1:39:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5980) completely neglect I mean I I checked  
[1:39:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5983) many penal code in different countries  
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5987) you know they say in in in the articles  
[1:39:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5990) is that if the if a new uh law uh  
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5993) becomes uh you know becomes established  
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5996) and passes by the parliament it  
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=5998) abrogates uh the previous law even even  
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6002) if it was uh General so so the the so so  
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6006) they so they have the same problem with  
[1:40:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6008) I don't if they say that or if they have  
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6011) even an idea about abrogation in general  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6013) specific this this static technicalities  
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6017) have developed essentially about Islamic  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6019) scholars Islamic  
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6025) has these two unique unique system first  
[1:40:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6028) system is the unique system of of isnat  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6030) and Hadith  
[1:40:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6032) and the second unique system which  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6033) nobody has had is  
[1:40:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6035) and if you did not participate with us  
[1:40:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6037) in the Holocaust I think we have  
[1:40:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6038) recording of the halach and so on and  
[1:40:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6041) the discussion about ahmedi rash may  
[1:40:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6043) remember a recording and so on and the  
[1:40:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6045) the Western scholar who said that said  
[1:40:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6047) this is an approach to law and so on or  
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6050) is not known to any other Nation but not  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6052) even to the West now  
[1:40:54](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6054) oh  
[1:40:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6057) because because from my reading from my  
[1:41:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6060) understanding is that I think it now  
[1:41:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6062) nowadays in the modern state it becomes  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6064) like a fixed principle uh to all  
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6068) lawmakers they say that whatever law  
[1:41:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6071) becomes uh passes in the parliament it  
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6074) becomes the uh the the acting law so so  
[1:41:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6079) so all lawmakers so all lawyers and  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6082) judges  
[1:41:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6084) what you are saying probably mistake  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6086) about law to be applied but we are  
[1:41:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6087) talking here about Revelation statements  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6089) of the revelation  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6091) oh yeah it's different here how to drive  
[1:41:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6093) from a statement's law and regulations  
[1:41:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6095) and fact so we are taking another level  
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6097) of deduction not not a law is just a  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6100) final conclusion like if you conclude  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6102) from that elect what shafri said that's  
[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6104) now the law according to chatri that is  
[1:41:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6107) wrong the Jews from the relation that's  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6109) the problem it's not that it is because  
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6111) I said he said it's because abrogated  
[1:41:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6113) now you can fight at Michigan even if  
[1:41:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6115) they are peaceful they never started  
[1:41:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6117) anything they opened the doors for that  
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6118) one and so on I say that's wrong your  
[1:42:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6120) deduction is wrong but his law is that  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6123) if you adopt a chef hello you will apply  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6125) the snow like that but how it is derived  
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6127) because the law in in in our in our case  
[1:42:10](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6130) the first  
[1:42:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6131) in our case is derived from the  
[1:42:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6134) Revelation and the Revelation is coming  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6136) in textual wording and action of the  
[1:42:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6139) Prophet describe the words  
[1:42:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6140) so this has to be analyzed and this  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6142) place will have developed to reduce from  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6144) the Revelation the law or the freak  
[1:42:27](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6147) for The Other Guys the law is the act of  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6149) the parliament the will of the  
[1:42:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6150) parliament and if in doubt you can go to  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6152) see the the notes of the of the  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6154) discussion of the communities where they  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6156) discussed and explained so they cannot  
[1:42:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6158) be blamed because the act of the  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6160) sovereign already enacted as a law  
[1:42:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6163) so you don't see this problem there's no  
[1:42:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6165) problem there in some sense although it  
[1:42:47](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6167) may be some some places there may be  
[1:42:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6169) some some issues of problem there maybe  
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6170) but generally in the application maybe  
[1:42:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6173) some problem like for example the I'll  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6175) give you a relatively terrible example  
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6177) and we close this because we catch  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6178) household is that uh some some policeman  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6182) used to for example to to give give a  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6185) ticket and uh and uh and the take points  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6189) from driver whom he say who we see  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6192) eating a sandwich while driving say  
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6194) eating a sandwich similar he make a  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6195) class similar to to uh to listening to  
[1:43:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6199) the phone and you know listening to the  
[1:43:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6201) phone you take points off and so on as  
[1:43:22](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6202) well not by actual problem say there's  
[1:43:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6204) no difference for that in his  
[1:43:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6206) application now the question is he right  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6208) or wrongly that's on the application of  
[1:43:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6209) individual cases  
[1:43:32](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6212) clearly from the reason that this  
[1:43:35](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6215) prohibited to use the phone is that is  
[1:43:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6216) is that you have the full Focus not on  
[1:43:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6218) the street and you may cause accident  
[1:43:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6220) pushes have been proven by a fact  
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6222) so the you are punished by points and  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6224) and maybe a monetary penalty is eating  
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6228) similar to that taking your your  
[1:43:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6231) attention from the street that's not to  
[1:43:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6233) be analyzed because obviously law has  
[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6235) been acted with that intention does it  
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6237) apply here it has to be analyzed how  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6239) much being chewing and eating divert you  
[1:44:01](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6241) from poking the focusing on the state I  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6244) would say most likely he is wrong  
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6246) because uh eating putting up biting a  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6248) piece and chewing and watching the state  
[1:44:09](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6249) it will not interfere because this is  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6251) almost like a mechanical act it's not  
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6253) like talking in the telephone or texting  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6255) definitely not  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6257) yes so he's not but on that ground  
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6261) yes yes the reason for chaos is not  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6264) there  
[1:44:25](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6265) lastly I just want to mention the last  
[1:44:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6268) thing and maybe we'll close after this  
[1:44:29](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6269) uh you you actually responded to  
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6273) Scholars like Imam shafri by saying by  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6276) mentioning the Ayah  
[1:44:41](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6281) and you like you highlighted  
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6284) those who uh fight you so and and your  
[1:44:49](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6289) argument is that this Ayah cannot be  
[1:44:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6291) abrogated I I also want to add a a small  
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6295) note  
[1:44:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6297) it can be abrogated the sovereign  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6320) [Music]  
[1:45:26](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6326) Define differently  
[1:45:28](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6328) Allah changed  
[1:45:30](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6330) the reality of things like for example  
[1:45:33](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6333) to eat it's not that it's by Divine  
[1:45:37](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6337) permission  
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6338) yes yes  
[1:45:40](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6340) let us take don't go in in the Deep  
[1:45:43](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6343) philosophical issues about what is uh  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6345) how the surveillance subhanallah uh in  
[1:45:48](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6348) ultimately inequitable he wants and so  
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6351) on the only limitation related to the  
[1:45:53](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6353) Divine attributes that's all but let's  
[1:45:55](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6355) leave that the follow says will come  
[1:45:57](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6357) Michelle and all these points will be  
[1:45:58](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6358) discussed  
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6360) thank you so much thank you  
[1:46:16](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6376) finished this  
[1:46:19](https://youtu.be/i2a6Y5iUEEE?t=6379) okay yeah
