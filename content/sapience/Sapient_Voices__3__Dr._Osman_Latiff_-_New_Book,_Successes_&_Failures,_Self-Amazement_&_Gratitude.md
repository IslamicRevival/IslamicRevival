[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=39) going to go straight into insha allah  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=41) dr uthman latif is a senior researcher

[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=75) into right now is because of the amazing  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=78) writing that has done for say pence

[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=87) first and foremost  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=88) allah says  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=91) so doctor you know i'm always fascinated  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=93) at your ability to write on kind of  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=95) different topics that are not really  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=98) related and become an expert in that  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=100) topic and also be able to write in that  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=102) topic so for example obviously you wrote  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=104) on being human for us and on being human  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=106) it was part of your postdoctoral work as  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=108) well othering dehumanization but then  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=110) after you went all the way to the other  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=113) side of the intellectual world if you  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=114) like in a different landscape and you  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=116) had to deal with your philosophical  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=118) issues divine perfection sociology  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=120) hematology you know salvation theory the  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=123) concept of sin in islamic christianity  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=126) divine love and then now  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=128) you're working on something else  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=130) concerning how we must be as  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=133) preachers of islam as dua as those who  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=135) want to go out in the world and  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=137) articulate a positive positive message  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=139) of islam now you're talking about  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=142) psychology you're talking about way of  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=144) being how we must relate to people in  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=146) the most positive way and in a way  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=148) that's in line with the prophetic  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=150) tradition how do you do that i mean  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=152) what's the process  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=154) is  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=162) all goodness comes from him and we begin  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=164) of course by reminding ourselves that we  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=166) are we are where really where we should  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=168) be in terms of that dua of uh musa  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=170) alayhi islam when he gets to madyan  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=172) and there is a process of um realization  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=176) because there's an actualizing and  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=179) verbalizing so he of course sees these  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=181) two these two young girls and they they  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=183) can't watch their sheep and they held  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=185) back  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=186) and so we asked them what's up with you  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=188) guys and they said this is a situation  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=190) old man and allah says  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=192) that he watered the sheep for them so  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=193) therefore there is a sense of service  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=195) there a duty there is fulfilling an  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=197) obligation there is doing a good deed a  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=199) good work  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=201) and then of course allah says  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=204) then it turns towards the shade and  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=206) somalia they say kind of it represents  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=207) his sense of ikhlas and because he's  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=209) he's not hanging around long enough for  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=211) them to say thank you very much if we'll  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=213) eat it for us and then he says beautiful  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=218) whatever goodness you send to me oh  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=220) allah i'm desperately in need of and all  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=222) of us are fukara all of us are poor  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=224) impoverished before allah subhanahu  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=225) wa'ta'ala desperate in need of things  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=228) while we can do them and i think that  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=229) that's a perspective i think that like  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=232) you mentioned um i don't see myself as a  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=234) very prolific writer or anything um i  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=237) don't see myself as that but i think  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=238) that what we can do to help us uh  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=241) develop some some sense of confidence in  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=244) wanting at least to write or share the  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=246) message of islam  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=247) is it begins with having a sincere i  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=250) think having a sincere  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=252) concern uh i began writing divine  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=255) perfection end of 2020 if you remember  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=257) and i really i i really felt as if this  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=261) individual needs a response because  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=264) because there's such wrong information  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=266) about islam and i think that i think  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=269) that's a strong stimulus for a person uh  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=272) if he notices something that's said so  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=275) wrong about something he holds so there  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=276) which is of course islam itself and then  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=278) he would feel a drive at least to try  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=280) and i and of course i had so many  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=282) hiccups on the way of writing that book  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=283) you know yourself so many hiccups so  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=286) many things i got wrong and i needed to  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=287) add this and there were so many edits  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=289) and reviews and this and that  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=291) but that didn't i mean it didn't upset  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=293) me in fact it helped me i think  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=294) alhamdulillah because um because i'm  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=297) we're all only human we're only we're  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=299) not perfect and and no book is perfect  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=300) except the book of allah subhanallah  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=302) it's a reminder that when i give talks  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=304) for example usually sometimes uh i might  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=307) prepare a talk like i have a football  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=309) today inshallah soon i prepared my nose  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=311) right over here over here right and so  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=313) usually i want to hit home a strong  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=315) message but i might sometimes do the  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=317) talk and i forget the main main message  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=319) i wanted to deliver to the people and  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=320) what happened to you also and then i  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=322) just remind myself that no speech is  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=324) perfect except the speech of allah so  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=326) i'm bound therefore to have an  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=328) imperfection in my speech and my  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=329) preparation for it and in my delivery of  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=331) it and that's fine because i'm just  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=333) assuming we're all as humans but i think  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=335) that alhamdulillah if i was to say like  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=337) what i what i try and do and i think  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=338) it's an advisor for myself and for  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=340) others  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=342) is uh currently i'm teaching a book by  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=344) ibn rajab hanbali called uh  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=349) and it's translated as journey to allah  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=352) like  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=353) has translated into the text  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=355) but it's not called journey to allah  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=357) it's called  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=359) which means  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=361) means like the way the qibla  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=363) and said means in traveling and a dulja  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=366) is a dulja is the last portion of the  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=369) night that's the that's what the book is  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=371) so it's like the clear way in traveling  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=374) to the last portion of the night and his  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=376) whole book subhanallah had i known  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=378) before i would have used it a lot in my  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=379) book don't forget because the whole book  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=381) is about one single hadith and this  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=384) hadith is when the prophet says that  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=386) none of you will enter heaven but none  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=388) of you will be saved because of his  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=390) deeds right and it's not even you it's  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=392) not even  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=395) and then he said in different narrations  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=400) and then be firm be balanced and journey  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=403) to allah in the beginning of the day and  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=406) the end of the day and washing and  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=408) something have something from the last  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=410) portion of the night and the whole book  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=413) is explaining this one hadith in  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=415) different kind of ways and different  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=417) kind of look it's very interesting but  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=419) one thing that's emphasized that we try  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=420) and practice in in our course is what  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=423) are the practical steps we take to  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=424) ensure that the the beginning of the day  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=427) becomes so essential and consequential  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=430) that it has leaves an imprint on the  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=432) remaining part of the day so that by the  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=434) end of the day you're somewhere good  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=437) because of how you began your morning  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=440) and so aside from therefore praying fajr  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=442) and then try praying the mess and  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=443) everything else but we say for example  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=445) we have like this we try and practice  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=447) this that we wake up in the morning and  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=450) i say look i said you're going to brush  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=451) your teeth you're going to wash your  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=452) face anyway but turn that into a wudhu  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=453) make a wudhu you know when you're a kid  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=455) in the morning and now it's like you're  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=457) you're free sailing once you've made  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=459) your wudu and it's a very powerful very  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=461) powerful thing and i say let's all try  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=463) and practice our boha if you pray your  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=465) boha prayer because remember aloha  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=468) it's like it's not obligatory but it's  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=470) encouraged and the prophet prayed it and  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=472) this is like the prophet says for every  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=474) the join in your human body it's a  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=477) sadaka it's a church for every joy in  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=479) your body it's a way of saying thank you  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=481) to allah for you being you and the fact  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=484) that your limbs can move and he also  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=486) does the prayer of the wabin the awa  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=488) being are the ones who are returning  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=490) always back to allah  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=492) like for example look in the quran in uh  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=495) certain uh i think surah  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=497) no no  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=498) yeah  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=499) no no no maybe surah al-anbiya maybe but  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=503) it concerns  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=504) the  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=505) the the description of  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=507) um  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=508) when allah says to uh sorry it's an  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=511) early it said  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=513) and allah says  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=515) be patient with what they say against  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=516) you giving away  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=518) and then he says with quran  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=523) and remember our servant that would  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=526) and he had power but it was power of  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=528) obedience to allah and he was awab so  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=530) awab is one that's  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=532) returning back to allah then allah says  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=534) we cause the the mountains to remember  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=537) allah with him and the birds above him  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=539) to do the same and allah says all of  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=541) them were allah allah goes on to say  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=543) allah blessing with a child  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=546) a beautiful child in sullivan and he  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=548) also was allah everything became moving  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=551) in his landscape because he began the  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=553) process of remembering allah that i mean  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=555) if you begin allah makes the world move  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=557) with you right in the remembrance of  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=559) allah and i say i think that's a  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=560) powerful thing so how you begin your  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=563) morning that's the advice if not gives  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=564) in his book uh is it has a big impact  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=567) and i think then there's baraka's  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=569) blessing so for example i try and  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=572) because i'm married i have children  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=574) i do other stuff as well uh you don't  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=576) get all the time to sit down for lengthy  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=579) periods and simply write i mean that's a  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=582) that's a blessing i wishing show i had  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=584) uh but it's it's small portions  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=587) throughout the day so i'll begin to  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=588) write in the morning early in the  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=590) morning and then in the afternoon and  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=591) the evening sometimes late in the  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=593) evening and i try and therefore make  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=594) sure that i've i've done  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=596) i've done work in the day  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=598) and uh and sometimes it's not even it's  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=601) not always easy because you have other  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=603) things to do in whatever traveling but  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=605) something's always better than nothing  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=606) alhamdulillah so and i think that  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=608) consistency even if it's small is what's  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=611) beloved to allah the hadith it says  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=614) beloved actions to allah  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=618) the continuous ones even if they're  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=620) small some days for example i intend to  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=622) write like a thousand words today that's  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=625) kind of a target i have uh but i get to  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=627) around four five hundred and uh but it's  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=630) okay because at least i've written  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=632) whatever i could you know in in the  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=633) space of the time in light of other  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=635) commitments and stuff alhamdulillah so i  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=637) think uh  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=638) and i think the sense of discipline  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=640) discipline yourself you know reading i  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=642) think is really important because the  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=644) more you read then the more kind of you  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=646) learn about what you should be writing  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=647) about  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=648) and  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=649) all these things are really helpful  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=651) so the two main things i got from this  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=653) is you know attribute  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=655) all of this goodness to allah subhanahu  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=657) wa ta'ala and you thank him for even  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=659) having the ability to do this stuff  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=661) as per the muslim referred to  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=665) and also and this sounds quite  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=667) significant is  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=668) make sure you get your morning right you  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=670) know yeah it's a big thing there's a lot  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=672) of barakah in the morning  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=674) and  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=675) so you'd be praying your fajr and you'd  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=677) be you know hopefully staying awake  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=680) after fajr as best as possible depending  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=682) sometimes the winter and the nights  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=683) uh so the winter and the summer nights  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=685) obviously there's fluctuation but you  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=687) have  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=688) your morning dedicated to  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=690) to to allah obviously the whole day is  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=692) that dedicated to allah but there's  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=694) something special about the morning your  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=695) father then after fajr you have your to  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=697) have prayer and there's benefits in that  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=700) and so on and so forth and and even as  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=702) you mentioned the doha prayer is  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=704) actually related to gratitude in itself  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=705) because it's basically like a sadaqa for  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=707) all of our limbs  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=709) and you know and obviously  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=711) also talk about that is important for  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=713) health  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=714) the benefits of of the ham so  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=717) okay that's great so  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=719) that's the kind of  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=721) spiritual aspect and i'm not using the  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=723) word spiritual here just to secularize  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=724) the discussion and try to make a  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=725) distinction because it's all spiritual  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=727) for us isn't it yeah everything  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=728) is ta'ala  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=730) but when you when when you face certain  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=733) intellectual obstacles or like a  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=735) writer's block  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=737) what what are the kind of strategies  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=739) that you adopt or maybe it's just become  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=740) natural to you because not only did you  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=742) do a phd you did post doctoral work  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=744) maybe it's just natural you don't know  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=745) how to unpack it uh some people are like  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=747) that but you know could you tell us if  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=750) you could reflect on when you get a  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=752) writer's block or you have research  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=754) issues you have to read this book that  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=756) book and and try to you know work out an  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=758) argument  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=759) if when there is an obstacle what do you  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=761) do  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=763) yeah so i think i think the obvious  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=764) thing is to have someone to have  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=766) patience uh this is not a race you know  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=769) and allah doesn't burden the soul what  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=770) it can bear and we're only human and i  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=773) think that there is uh  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=776) we have expectations on ourselves that  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=777) we want to achieve so much but then  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=779) there's a realization about the  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=782) vulnerability and fragility of all human  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=784) affairs  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=785) and just like yourself you won't live  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=788) forever uh nor can your body function  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=792) continuously repetitively all the time  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=794) your eyes need rest and your ears and  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=796) everything is dressed and your body is  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=797) right over you and then it's an  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=798) important thing to realize today for it  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=800) could be for example sometimes i could  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=801) be writing something and honestly  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=804) you know i'd struggle to finish a  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=806) sentence because i just couldn't think  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=807) of the right word you know and it could  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=809) take like minutes minutes minutes  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=811) minutes five minutes ten minutes i mean  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=813) long time uh and i just put my leg up  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=815) put my legs up and let's kind of just uh  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=818) sit back on it sit back on it and until  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=820) i can think of something to do other  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=822) times for example uh you know it's  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=824) important not to be  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=826) uh so soaked into your work because then  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=829) you could for example not realize uh  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=831) that there could be a bigger thing that  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=833) you're missing or smaller things that  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=835) you're overlooking i just simply go for  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=837) a walk i go for i have a park very close  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=839) to where i live and let's go for a walk  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=840) in the park uh i think a big thing by  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=842) the way is your your morning and evening  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=844) at car i think it connects back to the  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=846) first question  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=849) his students said that i would see  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=851) ibrahimiya uh  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=853) recite like a car from like the morning  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=856) till lower time sometimes  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=858) and he would say things like if i don't  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=860) do it i have no strength energy in the  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=862) day it's like my breakfast for the day  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=865) so i think that never overlook your car  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=868) meaning your connection with allah  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=870) because it's really a big sense of  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=871) baraka for you and i think that every  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=873) all that you mentioned has a writer's  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=874) block um but it's something you have to  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=876) kind of overcome you know with patience  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=878) with sabar um and uh and with dua  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=882) and and just try and uh see how you can  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=884) move forward with it sometimes for  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=886) example  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=887) and this again i think it's just a  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=889) reflection of baraka i could have i  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=890) could be  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=891) writing something and and don't know  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=894) where where this should go  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=896) and there could be a book in my library  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=898) i haven't touched like in 10 15 years  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=901) and all of a sudden yeah honestly and  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=903) then you know it will kind of the the  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=905) corner of my eye will kind of look upon  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=907) this book and i'll just pick it up and  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=908) then and i'll find something that's so  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=910) relevant and so useful you know from  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=912) that book and i think that in when i was  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=913) doing my phd there was a rule that we  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=915) had as a student which is that you have  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=917) to follow the footnotes and that's  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=918) that's the rule you follow the footnotes  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=920) and if you do that then you realize  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=922) where you know where your argument is  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=924) stemming from and that's a big thing i  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=926) think it requires discipline so if  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=928) you're reading something look at the  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=930) footnote and then follow that footnote  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=932) through to try and go as far back as you  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=934) can  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=935) and then you'll just find so many so  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=937) many things to read so many things to  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=939) research so many things to try and amend  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=941) and correct and edit and take benefit  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=943) from and so on and so forth and i think  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=944) that then this is an endless process uh  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=947) you wouldn't have you wouldn't get uh  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=950) you wouldn't have a lot to do yeah no  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=951) it's after here that was quite powerful  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=953) so you know writer's block do you ask me  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=955) in the morning in the evening has it  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=957) been tamiya said this is it's his  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=958) strengths in actual fact i believe when  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=960) ibm had a problem of to see a problem of  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=963) exegesis understanding an ayah he would  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=965) go into sajdah and make dua yeah  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=968) so it's very very powerful so you know  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=970) obviously linking it to allah is the  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=972) most important thing but your other  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=974) strategies are quite powerful so okay  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=976) good so that's the writing stuff by the  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=978) way i i don't know i feel sorry for you  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=981) not in a bad way but it is tough because  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=983) our writing is very very tough  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=986) um again in getting it right it's easy  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=988) to write but  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=989) generally speaking but writing well is  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=992) hard and i think hemingway the famous uh  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=995) writer he said yeah writing is uh easy  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=997) you just go to your typewriter and you  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=999) bleed  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1000) yeah yeah you're describing as a very  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1002) hard process yeah i think one i think  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1004) one of the things bro i think that you  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1006) know you have to see  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1008) a kind of a purpose and usefulness in  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1011) whatever you're writing because if you  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1013) don't you will simply not have enough  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1015) steam to get you through yeah and it's  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1017) like a phd for example  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1020) and because you end up doing over three  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1021) or four years you have to have enough uh  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1025) believe in that in that idea or that  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1027) project or that that theme uh that can  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1029) take you through those three or four  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1031) years of writing otherwise you simply  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1032) you'll burn out you wouldn't have you  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1034) just bought event and i think that's a  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1035) very powerful so ever you're writing  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1037) there for make sure you you believe in  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1039) what you're writing you make sure you  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1041) you hold it there to your heart what  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1042) you're writing and then realize that it  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1044) might be that what you've written it may  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1047) not  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1048) uh you know you may not see the full  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1051) fruits of what you've written  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1053) uh  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1054) any in any time soon you might not i  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1056) mean you know in islamic history in fact  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1058) it's testimony to that on my phd i did  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1060) the i did i did the translations of the  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1062) poetry of assulami as sulaimi was ali  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1066) he was the uh the first chef if  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1068) he wrote as a response to the first  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1070) crusade he was the first person  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1072) and uh and his text kitab jihad was so  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1076) we have uh surviving what's called samad  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1078) which are like  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1079) manuscripts of public readings  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1083) and even found find them in in in in  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1085) books in in swast library and we know  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1088) therefore from a suleiman's text uh that  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1091) he read in the grand umaid mosque in  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1093) damascus we know who was present how  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1096) many were present how many women  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1098) how many were  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1099) women and who the scribe was and we we  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1103) have and the numbers were very small  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1105) very small numbers attended his his  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1108) gatherings for his grand text as a first  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1110) response to the crusade and it was a big  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1113) text it was gonna it was ready in small  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1115) portions but all together it wasn't that  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1117) many but the amazing thing is that 1187  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1121) the battle of hittin  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1122) uh it was his text and he had died 1105s  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1126) a long time before but his text was  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1128) brought out and his text was brought  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1130) even before even the mubarak's kitab  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1132) jihad texts they rejoiced this is a more  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1134) prominent one but it was a tsunami's  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1136) text so it was that grand text that was  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1138) used to motivate the the the muslims to  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1140) fight against christians  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1142) and then reconcile jerusalem  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1146) i mean this goes to show that  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1149) your class your intention will always  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1151) surpass your actions  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1153) yeah because yeah allah allah will bring  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1155) the fruits out of the text when allah  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1158) chooses to  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1160) when they're most needed it could be for  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1162) example you could write something and  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1164) you might think this is so needed now  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1167) but maybe allah just wants to wants you  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1170) to hold on to another time where it's  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1172) even more needed and then i'll bring it  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1174) out alone is best i mean but your job is  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1176) you simply convey and allah deals with  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1179) the  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1179) the uh you know the the effects of  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1182) whatever you're conveying later on well  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1183) that was a very profound point very  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1185) profound point that's why i advise  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1186) people to actually write because a  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1189) book's battery never dies you see no for  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1191) sure like you know when you do a lecture  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1192) a lecture is like not even a chapter of  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1194) a book maybe it's half a chapter  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1196) and you know who's gonna go and sit at a  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1198) computer screen and go through like 12  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1201) 16 20 hours of content it's not always  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1204) the case but when you have a book you  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1206) know  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1207) people are carrying books it's with them  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1209) it's part of their lifestyle and they're  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1212) engaging with the book and i think it's  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1213) important for pete for a lot of the art  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1216) to write because  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1217) books would kind of transcend the kind  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1219) of social media work in my view because  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1221) sometimes  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1223) it's very context-based you're reacting  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1224) to something or it's based on the  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1226) particular context books could be like  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1228) that too but a very good book just like  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1231) in the case that you've just spoken  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1232) about just like the books that you have  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1234) written on being human uh divine  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1236) perfection you know those books are  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1239) timeless because you're dealing with  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1240) timeless issues about who god is god's  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1243) love forgiveness him arthriology  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1245) saturology and that would you know  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1248) imagine gets translated in the future in  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1249) 20 languages you you now  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1252) open the door to you know engaging with  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1255) so many different people all around the  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1256) world so and we've seen this we've seen  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1258) this even look look at malcolm x's  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1260) autobiography like many of our brothers  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1262) they read the book today or malcolm x's  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1265) b had died what uh in 64  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1268) or 63 54 64 i think yes it's about what  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1273) nearly 40 years ago right or something  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1275) no more than 40 years ago subhanallah  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1278) it's like  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1279) 60 years ago right no  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1281) my mouth is dirty  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1284) 50 or 60 years ago and yet people are  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1286) still reading his autobiography and is  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1289) changing their life right i remember  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1291) when i read that book it changed my life  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1293) i took it with work to finish the book i  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1295) was so fascinated  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1298) in his story and so that's just one  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1301) example there are many many other  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1302) examples right so i think it is very you  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1304) know there this is my kind of input to  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1306) this podcast please brothers don't  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1309) underestimate writing you may  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1312) don't give up  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1313) uh long-term success for short-term  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1316) glory yeah because the final outcome is  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1320) for the righteous as allah says so focus  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1322) on the long-term vision yes we have to  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1324) do online work we have to do videos we  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1326) have to react we have to do these things  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1328) but in the long term you know where are  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1330) we where's the chest playing for the  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1332) long term and i see a key action is  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1334) actually doing more writing right and  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1336) it's very important to do that because  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1338) look at your book divine perfection  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1340) there was not one book in the english  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1342) speaking world by a muslim on this topic  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1345) dealing with dr craig's argument dealing  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1348) with you know the christian attack on  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1350) god's love on allah's love and so on and  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1352) so forth  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1353) and we fill the gap and i truly yeah  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1356) bro sorry for this you know when i was  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1358) speaking to one of the brothers i was  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1359) like because you know one of the muk  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1361) said one of the the makkah said one of  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1363) the objectives of dawah if allah's word  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1365) to be the highest  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1367) and this is like an expression of  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1369) um  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1370) us realizing that allah is worthy of  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1372) worship  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1373) and this is sometimes forgotten we chase  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1375) the results but we don't chase the other  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1377) muk said what i mean by results is  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1378) shahadas and so on and so forth but what  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1380) about the one of the greatest  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1383) maksa the greatest objective which is  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1384) making allah's word the highest and i  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1386) said to one brother even if no one reads  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1388) this book i'm gonna be happy  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1390) the very fact that we  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1393) that we i said something like that the  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1395) very fact that we that you wrote this  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1396) book and we're showing who allah is he  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1399) is the one who is maximally loving and  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1401) maximally forgiving and any other  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1403) theological conceptual attack has been  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1405) annihilated and obliterated we have made  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1407) allah's word the highest right because  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1410) that that's who allah is he is worthy of  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1412) worship worthy of extensive praise and  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1414) the very fact we did that you know in in  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1416) in that sense me being involved in a  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1418) small way  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1419) i was like you know what a beautiful  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1421) thing what a beautiful thing to to show  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1423) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1426) you say i made your word the highest  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1429) they were attacking you and i made you  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1431) your word the highest and for me  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1433) that's right i wasn't even i'd even  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1434) really well i cared but i wasn't that  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1437) concerned about the readership because  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1439) just by doing i know they'll be barakah  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1441) so  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1442) in that context you've you've you've  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1444) contacted dr william lane craig because  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1446) the book is a is about addressing his  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1448) key arguments against islam and allah  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1450) which echoes his predecessors as well  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1453) uh you said you wrote to him recently  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1454) what did you say  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1456) no i haven't received replies yet from  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1457) him but i kind of uh you know i wrote a  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1460) nice thing to him  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1462) uh again saying that this is a book in  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1464) response to his  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1465) uh  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1466) his comments  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1467) arguments about islam from his website  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1469) and from his speeches and debates and  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1472) each of my chapters in fact deals with  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1473) one of his arguments  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1475) i think the other thing is you mentioned  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1476) about see people have responded to  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1479) william lane craig in debates he's  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1481) debated with famous muslim you know  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1483) scholars and speakers and but i think  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1485) that that's  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1487) maybe  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1488) why people didn't feel the need to write  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1489) something but i think that's a mistake  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1492) because  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1493) they weren't very good just be honest i  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1494) mean they weren't optimal in my view  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1496) that's why we thought there was a gap in  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1497) the market yeah maybe because there  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1499) isn't that much of a time to convey a  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1501) full islamic response to a person's in a  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1503) few minutes you have in a debate format  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1505) there isn't enough time to do that uh  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1507) whereas if you if you take your time and  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1509) you begin to unpack like for example you  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1511) know that when i began to write the book  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1513) it wasn't just william named craig  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1515) making these points it goes all the way  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1517) back to you know this individual  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1519) you know  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1520) thomas aquinas and john of damascus  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1523) right john damascus  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1525) before it goes back to him so and i fin  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1528) and i found it  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1530) and this is a good thing about reading  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1531) because when you research you uncover  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1533) unpack so much more like it wasn't just  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1535) william named craig it was samuel  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1538) zwiemer it was bilisiko and it was  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1540) john the mosque because it was thomas it  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1542) was so many other people that are also  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1544) misquoting the quran just like the later  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1547) ones both the the salaf and the khalifa  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1549) are doing the same thing  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1552) when i read your essay and it's in the  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1554) book as well there's an ex expanded  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1556) version of it in your book on amazon  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1559) and general damascus i was like what  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1561) liars  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1562) yeah yeah like honestly like they're  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1564) praised in in western culture to certain  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1567) degree don't get me wrong we don't  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1568) reduce people to their mistakes and  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1570) there's nothing we take from anyone even  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1572) from shaytan himself right because we  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1574) learned that we look the virtues of uh  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1576) of uh  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1578) from right but the point here is  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1581) are you just thinking how could they  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1583) blatantly lie like this about  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1585) you know the prophet sallallahu alaihi  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1588) wasallam about islam it was just it's  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1590) terrifying yeah it's terrific yeah  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1594) you know they haven't been held to  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1595) account intellectually and your peace is  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1597) just phenomenal so  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1598) okay um  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1599) the point i wanted to mention was now is  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1602) right so we've talked about writing  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1603) we've talked about how you deal with  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1605) obstacles we've talked a little bit  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1606) about you know the kind of routine that  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1608) you should have in place making dua to  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1610) allah  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1616) now  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1618) i just want to focus a little bit on  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1620) what you're writing at the moment for  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1621) sapience right and then after i want to  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1622) ask you a question about you know how do  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1624) we respond to successes in the tower and  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1627) we want to connect it to gratitude and  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1629) humility and istighfard and so on and so  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1631) forth which is very important  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1633) but  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1634) now what are you writing talk to me  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1636) so right now i'm writing alhamdulillah a  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1638) piece on  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1646) and i think it's a big thing a very  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1647) important thing because all of us in  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1649) fact aspire to be dua we want to be of  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1651) those who call to allah subhanahu wa  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1652) ta'ala  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1653) yesterday i had a lighthouse mentoring  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1655) session with a brother from kiel  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1657) university studying medicine final year  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1659) and he said i want to just give dao  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1661) and uh so the long conversation about  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1663) kind of what to do and and different  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1665) courses that we have and this and that  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1666) but i think that's kind of a big  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1667) aspiration for muslims but then what are  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1670) the characteristics of the duart you  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1672) know what are the things that they  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1674) should have embodied in their spirit in  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1676) their character in their mannerism in  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1678) their approach  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1680) towards those that are calling to and in  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1682) fact so i'm using there for the quran  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1684) as the main as the main thing because  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1685) the quran of course gives us examples of  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1687) many uh of the prophets of allah each of  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1690) whom was adai to allah subhanahu wa  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1692) but these beautiful things in the quran  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1694) this beautiful psychology of the of the  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1696) tawa in the quran there's things that  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1698) they say that they don't say the things  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1700) that they do and they don't do and i  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1702) think that there's so much for us here  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1703) to learn lessons from so we can for  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1705) example if you look at for example  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1707) the  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1707) importance of sabbath of patience  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1710) you have many examples in the quran  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1712) about those who were patient in dawah  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1715) and again like the point you mentioned  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1717) before you could be expecting quick  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1719) results like you might say but this  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1720) person didn't accept islam or this  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1722) person didn't kind of agree with the  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1724) point uh but you remember when allah  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1727) says  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1729) it's not you who guides people but allah  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1732) guides whomever he pleases and this was  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1733) revealed concerning the prophet's uncle  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1735) abu talib who he of course wished he  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1737) would become a muslim because he was a  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1738) porter of of the prophet and his cause  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1740) you know during his uh  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1742) time in makkah um but allah but he  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1744) didn't find guidance so therefore uh it  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1746) was a way of showing  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1748) that it's not you for you to feel  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1751) uh a sense of uh you know like  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1754) don't feel um what's the word like don't  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1756) feel despondent don't feel despondent  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1759) that people didn't embrace islam because  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1761) your job is to convey that's your job  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1763) your bashir wanna you convey  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1770) but your job is to convey the message as  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1772) best as you can in in clear  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1774) communication using strong arguments and  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1777) showing compassion that's a very key  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1779) thing so i could therefore take back  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1781) from what i've written in on being human  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1783) and use some of the stuff because the  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1785) book in fact talks about human empathy  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1787) and the prophets had empathy with their  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1789) people even the expression  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1792) so if you think about yakomi like oh my  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1794) people that shows that there is a  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1797) connection between them and their people  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1800) meaning it's something that they've  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1801) shared together in history in memory and  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1805) experiences in culture in ethnicity in  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1808) language in food all of these things  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1810) meaning they're my peoples they're being  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1813) i share all these things with you  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1815) and i think that that's important  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1816) because that's showing empathic  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1817) connection like we have from on the book  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1819) on being other things as well like  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1821) courage uh you know a discipline uh  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1825) again dua is quite key as well you know  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1826) for this case about the same kind of  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1828) stuff like always asking allah for help  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1829) and assistance isn't that um  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1831) alhamdulillah i'm kind of uh i'm about  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1834) 20 just over 20 000 words  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1836) oh my god  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1838) the thing with this book is not only  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1840) it's going to be a book but it's going  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1841) to be a course yeah yeah that's right  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1843) that's right we have a learning platform  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1845) and we have free courses on there and  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1847) it's aimed to basically  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1849) ensure that people who go through the  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1851) courses they're able to share some  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1853) academically and intellectually so this  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1855) sounds quite fascinating  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1857) what's different about the book is i  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1858) don't just simply focus on what are the  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1861) attributes of the day but i have a i  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1863) have done a subsection that goes with  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1865) everyone which is how do you achieve how  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1867) do we get in these attributes we had  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1869) this discussion because  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1872) it's so important that  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1875) you know there are so many books that  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1876) say do this do that the quran says  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1879) that  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1880) but you know our job and i've been  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1883) focusing on this you know past  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1885) week or so not a massive focus but i had  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1888) a meeting with someone who deals with  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1889) ontological training and kind of  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1892) transformational learning  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1894) and what's what i've realized is that  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1896) there is a massive gap  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1898) in the daoa in learning in our pedagogy  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1902) because we focus on  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1904) informational type of learning  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1906) but we need to focus on transformational  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1909) type of learning and i've mentioned  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1910) before  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1912) we could know all of the ayat on zika  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1915) all of the ahadith on vikkar but we will  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1917) never become a person of zikr so there  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1920) is a gap between what we know from an  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1922) informational point of view and who we  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1925) become how we are transformed we need to  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1927) try and close that gap and this book is  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1930) fantastic because you're helping people  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1933) transforming into what they should  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1935) become  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1937) calling people to allah and it's so  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1940) significant you know for example i know  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1942) what good food is in actual fact i could  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1944) probably write a book on how to  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1946) you know  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1947) train well how to eat well how to have  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1949) like seven percent body fat how to gain  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1951) muscle how to be a good boxer i could  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1953) put all of that down in a book i  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1954) probably could just from experience  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1957) but do i eat well  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1959) like what did i have this morning like  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1961) it wasn't healthy so the thing is just  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1964) because i may know something in  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1965) abstraction in an informational sense it  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1967) doesn't now mean it's going to transform  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1969) me  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1970) and this is so critical in the next  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1973) stage of the dawah especially in the  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1975) western world is that we get people to  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1978) engage in transformational learning yeah  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1981) and so this is called this is called  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1984) kefir this is called the howness of the  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1986) action you know so  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1988) when he says that allah you know allah  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1990) gave you power so we could see  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1993) how would you behave  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1996) not simply what you would do but how  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=1998) would you do what you do so for example  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2000) if you take anything in life for example  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2002) allah says for example uh you know speak  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2005) good to people speak good to people but  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2007) there's something i used to do for  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2008) example marriage counseling before i i  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2010) do like much less of it now uh and i had  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2013) one example so this is a true story so  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2015) one one one sister came and she she was  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2018) saying that i have a problem with my  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2019) husband and uh and i said she said she  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2022) said to me she said my husband lacks  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2023) empathy that was her thing yeah he lacks  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2026) yeah that's what she said  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2028) so and then again we had a meeting  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2030) together i mean with both of them there  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2032) and i said brother this is kind of a  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2033) complaint you know permissive wife and  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2035) uh he said it's true brother it's true  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2037) brother yeah he said because my family  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2040) don't have empathy my parents never  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2042) raised me like that so i can't i can't  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2044) understand what that is all about and  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2046) everything  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2047) and then i had to do a separate session  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2049) with him subhanallah where i would i  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2051) would guide him words that he could use  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2054) teach him stuff's words it was so simple  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2058) like you know words he could use that  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2060) could kind of uh help like things he  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2062) could say and how he's how he should say  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2064) them you know and i think that's so  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2066) that's so key because sometimes you  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2067) might say do something but without  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2070) telling the people how it is that that  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2073) should be done uh it's like it's like  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2076) doing half the job it's like you've done  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2078) half the thing which is telling i need  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2080) to do that thing without telling me how  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2081) it should be done because the whole  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2083) element is so key it's like for example  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2085) the prophet said after  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2088) now you could have two people  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2090) and one person and i remember this from  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2091) years ago this i brought it from the  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2093) mosque whenever he would give salaam he  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2095) would always smile and give salam  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2097) always like he wouldn't just give  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2098) assalaamu alaikum like you know it was  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2101) it was it was it was  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2103) with a smile and it made such a  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2105) difference because you think wow this  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2106) person means like peace be on you my  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2109) dear brother  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2110) or embracing someone hugging someone and  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2113) smiling and salam all these things are  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2115) like furnishing features you know of of  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2117) the act of giving the salam and so i  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2119) think therefore focusing in something so  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2121) important like dawa  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2123) and knowing how to say or or giving  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2125) examples what's that for example have a  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2127) small section on  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2129) you know you could you could meet people  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2131) uh for the first time so they they might  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2133) not you know they might not be uh  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2136) they might come to a double table or  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2137) stall for example you know but then how  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2140) do you break the ice how do you begin a  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2142) conversation with them and you might not  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2144) say for example yakomi oh my people you  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2147) see you might not say like the prophet  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2148) but there is something you could  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2149) extrapolate from that because you call  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2151) me like i mentioned it kind of connotes  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2153) all these things of of similarity like  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2156) we call these human codes of  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2157) recognizability i write about that in  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2159) another book and so therefore by saying  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2161) you have called me in in the context of  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2162) today you could say for example uh you  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2165) know the the petrol costs are rising for  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2167) example you know but i i i'm facing them  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2170) you're facing them and we're in the same  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2172) boat like you know energy costs are  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2173) rising we're in the same situation so  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2175) what's what's kind of similar is very  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2178) key at the same because it creates a  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2179) sense of human connection between you  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2181) and the person you're speaking to and  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2183) then if you then bring in the message of  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2185) islam it can have more of an effect in  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2186) terms of uh people reciprocating in  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2189) different ways and so absolutely  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2191) absolutely that's extremely fascinating  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2192) it's important it's really interesting  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2194) you mentioned language  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2195) because in  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2197) transformational learning there are  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2198) three key components i forgot the third  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2200) one but two of them are the language  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2202) that you you use  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2204) and your behavior  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2205) your  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2206) your weight your your physic your  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2208) physicality how you engage physics in  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2210) the world  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2212) and that's why language is so  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2213) significant how you frame things changes  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2216) everything yeah yeah for example if you  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2218) want someone to be positive you change  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2220) their language and you get them to  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2221) change their body  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2223) the way they behave in their body  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2224) structure and when you link those two  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2226) things together and there's a third  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2227) component i forgot it now but basically  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2229) that creates transformation wow so  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2231) that's awesome i'm really really i'm  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2233) looking forward to doing a  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2235) review of the book  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2242) what did you say it was worse than your  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2243) phd vibe  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2245) terrible terrible  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2248) yeah but you are such a joy to work with  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2251) i've never heard a complaint from you  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2253) i've never  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2254) you know people sometimes when they own  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2256) they they have emotional and spiritual  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2259) intellectual ownership of something and  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2260) then it gets poked many times  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2263) like they get like oh you know what  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2264) you're doing you're frustrating me i  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2265) mean with you is this a ease and may  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2267) allah bless you and guide you and you  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2269) find me the best  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2272) looking forward to that work that's  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2273) fantastic and obviously the course that  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2275) will come from it as well  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2276) um so now i want to talk about successes  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2280) in the tower so  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2281) you know alhamdulillah  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2286) you know people get  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2288) shahada's people become muslim and you  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2291) know there's there's great efforts  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2292) happening online and offline people are  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2294) writing books they're delivering videos  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2297) they're doing  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2298) um  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2299) so many so many amazing things at  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2301) different levels as well even on the  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2302) academic level like i was having a a  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2304) private meeting with university of  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2306) birmingham they're doing some research  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2307) on science and islam from a kind of  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2309) sociological perspective so they asked  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2311) me to be one of the the interviewees  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2314) and i and we were we were they were  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2316) asking stuff about evolution and  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2318) darwinism and we were making a contrast  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2320) between what's happening now what  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2321) happened 15 or 20 years ago  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2322) alhamdulillah alhamdulillah we have so  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2325) many people now like doctor sri malek we  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2328) have subur ahmed doing his phd and  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2330) people engage in this area in a nuanced  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2332) way and and we're not basically  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2334) articulating ourselves in a way that  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2336) would be described as sub-optimal it's  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2338) it's changed it's improving from an  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2340) academic level and even looking when you  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2342) look at organizations like aira  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2344) you know  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2345) 50 000 shahadas from june to july or  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2348) something alhamdulillah  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2349) you know  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2350) great work  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2352) all around the world now  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2354) how do we respond to these successes  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2357) what and the reason i feel this is so  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2358) important because  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2361) we  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2362) i'm afraid that we will not have the  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2365) next generation there'll be no barakah  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2367) the next generation  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2368) if we don't respond adequately to to our  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2371) successes because sometimes  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2373) we attribute success just to ourselves  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2375) that we have the intrinsic power we have  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2377) the sense of urgent which is you know  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2380) vanity or this delusional understanding  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2382) that it was because of me because of us  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2385) and this is one of the key spiritual  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2387) diseases of the heart so  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2389) how must we respond to successes what  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2391) should be the way of being the spiritual  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2393) response of the muslim when they receive  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2396) successes in the tower let me give you  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2398) an example yeah like you know because we  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2400) just had the finishing of the first ten  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2401) days of the hija and of course you have  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2403) may allah accept from the hajjaj you  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2404) being  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2405) in during the hajj and it's a big thing  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2407) it's a big effort and but there's  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2409) something so interesting in the quran  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2410) about this  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2412) [Music]  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2419) says now when the rituals have come to  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2420) an end remember allah  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2425) even more than that now if you think  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2427) about you think how old  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2428) everything in the hajj in the rituals is  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2431) full of remembrance of allah the tawaf  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2436) everything is all all remnants of allah  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2438) but allah is saying now you finish your  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2439) rituals now remember allah like you  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2442) remember your fathers of the father and  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2443) and also for example allah says  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2447) come to an end fed could allah remember  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2449) allah standing sitting lying down if you  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2451) think hold on i just spent the whole you  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2453) know time remembering allah and salah  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2454) and allah says  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2456) remember  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2457) it's allah for my remembrance so you  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2458) have been allah and salah but allah is  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2460) saying now you remember allah or for  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2462) example arafa allah says when you're  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2464) coming down from arafah into like muslim  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2467) allah says  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2468) remember allah so you think yourself  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2471) what is allah saying here because that  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2472) means  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2474) you know we we can't  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2476) it's like for example if you think about  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2478) the  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2479) the modes of a human existence you know  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2482) and allah is saying remember allah  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2484) standing sitting lying down every time  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2486) you think you've remembered allah allah  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2488) says remember allah now you begin your  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2491) islam for example the line from muhammad  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2493) ali when he says i heard it from uh  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2496) some he said that uh when do you uh  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2499) when when do you start when do you what  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2501) is  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2502) he says you might know because you he  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2504) says um when do you start count when do  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2506) you stop counting or something and he  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2508) says uh i started out starts hurting  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2510) yeah  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2513) i start counting when it starts hurting  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2514) so it's like never think therefore that  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2517) you've done something and number one  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2519) you've exhausted everything because  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2521) there's always things to do uh other  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2524) thing look for example in surah nasir in  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2526) the quran  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2529) when the victory in success from allah  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2531) comes and opening comes from allah and  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2533) you see people embracing islam in crowds  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2536) allah says  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2539) now remember allah  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2541) it's the same thing glorify and  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2542) celebrate praise of your lord in the  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2544) morning and evening hours and and ask  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2546) allah for forgiveness so allah is saying  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2548) therefore you are  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2550) a servant of allah your spiritual  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2553) nourishment energy is in his remembrance  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2556) your remembrance of him is indicative of  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2558) your love of him and your devotion to  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2560) him so therefore don't lose sight of the  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2562) you might say for example if we're  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2564) chasing after like only numbers numbers  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2566) and this and that you'll forget the  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2567) bigger point of i need to you know look  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2570) for example look allah sent muslim and i  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2572) write about this at length in my book  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2573) yeah allah sent musa to  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2575) go to firaoun he is  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2587) which means you know  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2588) make wide my church may give me that  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2590) sense of confidence bearing in this and  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2592) make easy for me my task and and loose  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2594) and not from my tongue because he would  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2596) speak with a lisp and because i want  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2598) people to understand what i'm saying so  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2599) he's asking allah for you know for  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2601) helping all of this and allah gave him a  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2603) special stick of course a stick to  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2604) transform into a serpent him and he had  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2606) powers that stick but still he asked  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2609) allah still he asked allah was  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2613) he sent me a supporter from my family my  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2616) brother haroon because he would  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2618) strengthen me with him but look at the  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2619) reason he provides look at the reasoning  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2621) provides he says  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2626) so we could glorify you much and  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2628) remember you much  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2629) i mean that's  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2630) he says to allah i only need that  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2632) support because you should be remembered  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2634) more and with me and my brother you'll  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2637) be around more with me and my brother as  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2639) opposed to only me so it's a completely  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2642) mindset change because that means that  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2644) your whole purpose is to ensure allah is  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2646) remembered and if i remember allah more  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2649) with you rather than without you then i  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2650) should remember allah with you rather  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2652) without you you know and i think that's  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2654) a that's an important thing for us to  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2655) bear in mind therefore if you make that  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2657) a focus that you know allah allah is to  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2660) be remembered subhanallah uh that's a  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2662) big thing so i think that like you  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2664) mentioned there is a danger of a job  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2666) is like you know vanity it's like  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2668) self-praise it's like self being  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2671) absorbed with your own  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2673) selfness and it's like allah gives  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2674) examples in the quran like for example  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2676) today is jummah we're sort of  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2677) and suzuka is a good example because you  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2679) have the man who had the two gardens and  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2681) allah says we gave him  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2684) allah we gave him the two gardens allah  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2686) allah gifted the man to adam but he was  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2689) so happy  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2690) with his gardens and all of the the  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2692) fruits and the trees and the lake that  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2694) would kind of the river that would kind  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2695) of stream between the the two gardens  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2698) and uh and then because of this he says  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2700) you know uh this is my own doing this is  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2702) my own doing and i and he felt so proud  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2704) in this  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2706) and and the believer who was his friend  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2708) he says to him uh why didn't you you  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2711) know when you had the god and simply say  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2713) masha allah  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2716) this is all from allah and all from  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2719) allah what is because he said it could  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2721) be it's what he said he said it could be  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2723) that you lose your guidance  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2726) it could be that the heavy rain comes  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2728) and the storm comes and destroys all of  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2730) your trees and everything else so why  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2731) don't you simply say masha'allah it's a  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2733) big lesson for us because it could be  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2735) something that you might devote your end  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2738) effort attention to life too  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2741) without realizing that i need to  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2743) attribute all of this that i'm doing  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2745) only to allah alone subhanallah  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2748) otherwise that wind and storm could come  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2751) and demolish everything and more than  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2753) that more than that the effect it would  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2756) have on my heart  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2757) on your heart  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2758) because all you present to allah is  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2761) salim is  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2763) musa came to  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2764) allah came to allah with a sound heart  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2767) and that is the heart that is free of  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2769) vanities pride shirk and all these  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2772) things so remember that whatever you're  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2774) doing in life you're doing because you  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2776) want your heart to be in a good state  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2779) nothing else i mean you will take  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2781) nothing to allah i mean you will have  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2784) nothing no no merchandise no pens  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2786) nothing nothing will mean anything  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2788) except the fact you're going to come to  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2790) allah with a heart that is in a good  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2792) state so everything you do  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2794) is is having an effect on your heart one  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2797) way or or the other way you know and  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2799) this is why diker of  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2801) is so key because it kind of cleanses  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2803) the heart  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2804) you know from from things kind of this  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2806) is amazing so i i'm thinking as well  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2809) from an organizational perspective  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2810) sometimes we can have a sense of  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2812) collective order  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2813) like we think that we've developed a  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2815) vision you know a world that receives  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2817) the message of islam and we have a  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2819) strategic focus which is that we share  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2822) islam academically and intellectually  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2823) and we develop others to do so the same  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2825) and we give that kind of strategy and  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2827) the vision and our modus operandi our  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2831) way of being in our learning platform we  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2833) give you some kind of intrinsic power  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2835) and sometimes we can we can move  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2839) ourselves away from  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2841) the true reality which is that  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2842) everything happens because of allah  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2844) subhanahu wa ta'ala  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2846) right  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2848) now there is no true power from the  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2850) power of subhanallah  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2851) and these are just gifts that allah has  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2853) given us and and this is just  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2856) a manifestation of allah's names and  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2858) attributes and allah has favored us has  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2860) given us a gift rather than there's  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2863) anything intrinsically special about my  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2866) own abilities right because it was  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2867) really allah and we have to remind  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2870) ourselves and i've seen this  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2871) organizationally bro with organizations  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2874) that have been i've been involved with  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2875) and you know even in sapience  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2878) when we start to give intrinsic power to  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2880) strategy don't get me wrong we have to  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2882) plan we have to strategize but if  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2884) spiritually intellectually we're giving  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2886) intrinsic power we think we've got it  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2889) right we've we've we've we've  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2892) we've broken the code or we've we've uh  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2894) we decrypted the code the divine code on  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2897) how to achieve success and then we did  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2899) it and we put it into place  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2901) what happens is there's a diminishing of  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2903) barakah  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2905) i noticed that there is a diminishing of  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2907) barakah and it's so important for aldo  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2910) art and i speak to myself of obviously  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2913) first and foremost to deal with the  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2914) urgent because audrey was one of the  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2916) four major spiritual diseases of the  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2918) heart where all the other spiritual  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2919) diseases emanate from you have kibar  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2921) which is arrogance you have arjuna which  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2923) is self-amazement you have hasad blame  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2925) worthy jealousy and you have raya  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2926) ostentation but and we need to be really  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2929) really careful with you but it's very  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2931) powerful what you mentioned concerning  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2933) the 10 10th chapter of the quran you  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2935) know when the victory of allah has come  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2937) and the conquest and you see the people  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2939) entering into the religion of allah in  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2941) multitudes then exalt him with praise of  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2944) your lord and ask forgiveness of him  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2946) indeed he is ever accepting of  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2948) repentance  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2950) so you you you hit the nail on the head  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2953) allah is  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2955) talking about the success that's coming  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2958) and our response should be humility  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2960) right because it wasn't it wasn't us it  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2964) was allah we should respond with  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2966) gratitude because we know it was allah  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2968) and we should praise him turn back to  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2970) him and repent so i think here we have a  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2974) the 11th 10th chapter of the quran gives  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2976) us a kind of criteria or a  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2978) self-assessment check that every time we  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2981) have successes even if we write an essay  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2983) or we post a video are we responding in  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2986) this way  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2987) is it increasing our humility is it  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2989) increasing our gratitude is it  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2992) increasing our praise of allah are we  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2994) turning back to him and repenting  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2996) this is extremely significant this is  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=2999) extremely significant and i think  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3001) everyone must have this in place and  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3003) just to repeat so we just really you  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3005) know you know have this in our hearts  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3007) every type of success that we have in  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3009) the tower are we responding with  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3011) humility with gratitude are we praising  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3014) allah are we turning back to allah and  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3016) are we repenting to him and this is so  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3019) significant if we're not we don't have  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3021) these things in place  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3022) then there could be a diminishing  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3024) barakah just like the man with the two  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3026) gardens it could be all taken away and  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3029) i've seen this and you see on different  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3031) levels it depends depending on how uh  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3034) how big the eardrum is individually or  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3036) collectively and i think it's a reminder  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3038) for ourselves and everybody that  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3040) all successes  
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3042) we have to respond with humility  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3043) gratitude praising allah turning back to  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3045) him and repenting  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3047) isn't that right  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3050) it's a wonderful thing you've just said  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3051) and really reality is  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3053) it's it's for all things dawah and  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3055) everything else as well it's for all  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3057) successes it's for the fact that allah  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3059) allowed you eyes to see and as to air  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3062) and the tongue to speak and limbs to  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3064) move allah gave you a heart that breeds  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3066) all of these things are indicative of  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3068) allah's divine favor upon you and time  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3071) and time in fact you know in my book i  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3072) have a i have a section on on divine  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3075) grace it's kind of it's not it's not um  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3077) title but i have the the verses because  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3079) our christian friends they oftentimes  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3081) make and by the way this is such a big  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3083) thing yeah it's such a big thing  
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3085) it's such a big thing because you'll  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3086) find that you'll find almost every  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3088) christian missionary saying exactly the  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3091) same thing muslims rely on their deeds  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3093) we rely on on the blood sacrifice of  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3095) jesus christ so they might see for  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3097) example we do good deeds like five  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3099) pillars praying and fasting as a god and  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3101) everything they're saying these people  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3102) look at them they're doing so many good  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3103) deeds they think they're relying on the  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3105) good deeds and i was in i was in the  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3108) island i said the same thing to dr  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3110) william dr michael nesseri i said you  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3112) guys always say this i said how can you  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3114) say this when allah the quran says not  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3115) once not twice not three times not for  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3117) them multiple times  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3122) if it was not for the grace and mercy of  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3124) allah you wouldn't have attained  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3125) purification it was not for again again  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3127) allah keeps saying the same if it was  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3129) not for allah's grace and mercy and  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3131) allah and hakeem and allah keep saying  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3133) the same thing meaning everything is  
[0:52:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3135) bound by the grace and the mercy of  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3137) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3139) nothing can happen  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3141) no good can be achieved if it wasn't for  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3143) that divine grace and mercy of allah you  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3145) know sufyan authority he says  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3147) he says  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3162) is another blessing that requires  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3163) another  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3164) that means you can't fully thank allah  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3167) because every time you do allah has  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3169) inspired you to thank him  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3171) so do you have to be this is why i think  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3173) it was him or husband that when he would  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3176) be in the night prayers  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3178) he would recite  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3191) that if you try to enumerate allah's  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3193) favors you wouldn't be able to and  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3194) almana is unjust and ungrateful and  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3197) every time he would read the verse he  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3199) would remember a favor and then repeat  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3201) the verse and the whole night was spent  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3203) reading the one verse of the quran  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3205) because he would have to remind himself  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3206) of the blessing again and again and  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3208) again and again and allah has blessed us  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3210) with so much so much so much subhanallah  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3213) i mean just the fact that you're alive  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3215) your your being alive  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3217) is a divine gift and blessing of allah  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3220) because that means in life  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3222) these are there's a reward of uh  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3224) from israel that even collects in this  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3227) text and it says that uh allah asked  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3229) allah says to nada says to allah  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3233) uh  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3234) told me what is the adnan what is the  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3236) least of your favorites to me  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3238) and allah says to that would  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3240) enough breathe  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3242) and then that would breathe and allah  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3243) this is the least of my favors to you  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3245) the fact that you're alive and there's  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3247) another one from israel that says that  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3249) uh allah says to that  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3254) thank me the way i deserve to be thanked  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3256) and says that the wood says the arabian  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3258) my lord how could i thank you that way  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3261) when thanking you is a blessing from you  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3263) and allah then says  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3265) now that would you thank me do i deserve  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3267) to be thanked because  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3270) it means  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3273) meaning to recognize allah's faith as a  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3275) person  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3276) what what's very interesting is about  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3279) the paradigm as well sometimes although  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3281) the frame how do we frame this sometimes  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3283) we frame it yes i'm going to be grateful  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3285) for my wife my children my car  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3287) but i like to go to the very kind of  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3289) fundamental aspects of our existence  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3291) because it would show if you can't be  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3293) fully grateful for the fundamental  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3294) aspects of your of your existence then  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3297) everything else is just a bonus right  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3300) so you know and this in a double context  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3302) you know what does allah say in chapter  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3304) 49 verse 17 right  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3307) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala talks about  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3310) he talks about that the people thought  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3313) that iman was a favor to the prophet  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3317) and allah says  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3318) no tell them that this is not a favor  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3321) unto you that we basically gave this is  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3323) a favor unto them we have blessed them  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3326) with a gift  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3327) and that's iman so from a dawah context  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3330) imagine the gift of calling other people  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3333) to iman  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3334) so if your own iman is a gift  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3337) and you're engaged in work that you're  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3339) calling others to iman others to faith  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3341) to islam then that's a compounded gift  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3344) right  
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3345) which is  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3346) fascinating so in terms of the frame  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3348) when i talk about existence like for  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3350) example i'd like to talk about maybe the  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3351) heartbeat or every conscious moment of  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3353) your existence yeah and so if i said to  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3356) someone oh i said i said to you you've  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3358) got 10 minutes left to live but to get  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3359) another 10 years or 10 days you have to  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3361) give me all of your wealth  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3363) you know many of you and you would throw  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3365) all your wealth at me which shows the  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3366) priceless nature of every conscious  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3368) moment  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3369) but we don't earn these conscious  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3371) moments we don't own them or necessarily  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3373) deserve them and we can't even create a  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3374) fly yeah they're given to us freely at  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3377) every conscious moment so if someone  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3379) gives you a priceless gift you don't  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3381) earn own or deserve how should it make  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3383) you feel  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3384) grateful and that's just life  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3387) that's his life every conscious moment  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3388) we're not even saying what you  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3389) experience in that moment we're seeing  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3392) the conscious moment itself so imagine  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3394) now those conscious moments are now full  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3396) of dawah  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3399) i mean  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3400) this is why  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3402) you know i've said this publicly and i  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3404) try and say this properly as well  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3408) i i will lie you know i don't know i  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3410) don't know  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3411) should i say this i don't i believe i  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3413) don't deserve anything you know  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3419) that's how i feel  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3421) because if you on and this is not like  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3423) some kind of you know look i'm coming  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3425) righteous you know  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3427) i truly believe that i'm the  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3429) the westerner amongst everybody but this  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3432) is the key is this once you understand  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3434) who allah is and how he manifests his  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3436) names and attributes in your life and in  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3438) the world in the cosmos then there is no  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3441) other way intellectually irrationally  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3442) spiritually just to conclude that you  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3444) don't deserve anything  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3447) and and and yeah it's just a phenomenal  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3450) phenomenal phenomenal understanding and  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3452) all of this links back to who allah is  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3454) and his his reality you know  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3456) so  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3458) yeah so in terms of gratitude in terms  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3460) of life hope though because this is  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3462) trying to shift it now so we know when  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3464) god to have successes  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3466) you know we should be praising allah it  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3468) should increase on our humility increase  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3470) in our gratitude we don't attribute  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3471) intrinsically to ourselves as sure islam  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3474) says my success comes from from allah  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3477) alone and also we respond with humility  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3480) gratitude is the father praising allah  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3483) and turning back to allah that's fine  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3485) but let's shift it now  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3487) sometimes in the tower you could just  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3490) hit rock bottom  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3491) you could say oh i'm not worthy of  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3493) you're engaging in this work or i don't  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3495) engage with this work anymore i'm facing  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3497) lots of struggles  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3499) how does now gratitude fit into that as  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3502) a way of being as a psychology how does  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3504) gratitude take you out of that state or  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3507) what else should they be reflecting upon  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3509) in to get themselves out of that state  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3511) because it's good talking about  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3513) successes but what if people hit rock  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3515) bottom what if they faced extreme  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3516) humiliation or they've they've lost uh a  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3519) debate or they've basically lost  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3522) motivation in engaging with dao  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3524) what then  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3525) yeah it's it's a beautiful thing by the  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3527) way you said a beautiful thing for one  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3528) of our repel  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3530) the fact that you know we we don't feel  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3532) ourselves deserving  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3534) and it's a it's a great state to be in  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3536) in fact because the servant of allah is  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3539) simply and perpetually fakir he's always  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3542) in a state of uh complete dependence  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3545) reliance and feeling of impoverishment  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3547) for allah  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3549) and i think that that's a that's  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3550) something that i think that should be  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3552) emphasized and stressed because that's a  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3554) beautiful state to be in  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3555) i think in life your question we know  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3557) there are many examples in the quran  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3559) that can help us look at the example of  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3561) eunis al-istan for example he was since  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3563) people of nineveh nineveh  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3565) and his people people of nineveh they uh  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3569) was slow in accepting they were  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3571) not not liking what he's saying and they  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3574) became seven and arrogant and because of  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3576) that and by the way when he goes off he  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3579) goes off angry but it was a good sense  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3581) of anger it was anger for the sake of  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3582) allah he's angry with the people maybe  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3585) thinking i could find a better people  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3586) than these chaps over here and he goes  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3588) off and as you know there was uh he's he  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3591) seeks safety in a ship but the ship was  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3593) full  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3594) and they had to cast lots and he was  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3596) thrown overboard and allah says  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3599) and he was the one that was to blame  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3601) meaning he should have remained patient  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3603) with his people um and patience is not  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3605) something that we can say for example  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3607) i've tried hard and they didn't listen  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3609) so therefore i got to stop because what  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3611) about nu al islam example in the quran  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3613) and new islam is dealing with them for  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3615) centuries calling them back to allah and  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3618) and by the way new al islam he says okay  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3620) so i call my people layla and one aha on  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3622) night and day and publicly privately but  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3624) what is known as i'm telling people he  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3625) said to them i'm saying to them ask  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3628) allah for forgiveness  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3630) and you'll find allah is forgiving and  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3632) if that happens you're the citizen of  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3635) allah will send you the reign and allah  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3636) will give you good children and and  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3638) wealth and everything else meaning allah  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3640) give you your blessings in this life and  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3642) the next life but that was his message  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3644) it was ask ask allah to forgive your  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3646) sins also forgive your sins but the  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3648) point is this it was a long campaign you  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3650) know with those people in eunice's  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3652) example  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3654) he loses hope with them and so therefore  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3656) it goes on the ship but allah says in  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3658) the quran  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3659) don't be like the companion of the fish  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3661) meaning like yunus allah says don't be  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3663) like eunice that islam city for although  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3665) he's like an amazing paradigm it's not  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3668) through his action of running from his  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3670) people that's not where he serves as an  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3672) example for us what comes after is  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3674) paradigmatic because now he's in the  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3676) belly of a whale swallows him whole he's  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3679) in the belly of the fish so what happens  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3680) allah says and by the way it's a  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3682) beautiful thing here yeah because  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3684) there's two different places where this  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3685) is made maybe even more one of them is  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3687) when allah says eunice was from the  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3689) messengers and it's  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3691) on when he goes and abakka by the way is  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3693) like the arabic the arabic is like the  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3695) runaway slave  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3696) so allah says he's like the runaway  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3698) slave and running away and the world  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3700) swallows him whole and uh and then if  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3703) anada feels almighty cries out in the  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3705) darkness this is very powerful because  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3706) nada feels  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3708) cries out in the darknesses and the  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3710) mufastrin they say darkness of the whale  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3712) darkness of the sea ducks of the night  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3714) three like sometimes you feel in your  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3716) life  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3717) layers and layers of difficulty one on  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3719) top of the other one there's this but  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3720) it's also there there's also that one as  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3722) well and uh and it's his prayer allah  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3728) that number one there's three layers  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3729) there's three there's three parts of his  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3731) prayer as well the scholars they say  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3733) because the first is to heed the second  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3735) is tasbee that is this take far or blame  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3738) and stick far he says  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3740) none deserves worship except you oh  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3742) allah subhanak all perfection belongs to  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3746) you and no imperfection belongs to your  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3747) word of all praise and then i was the  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3750) one that wronged my own soul and then  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3751) allah says  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3753) we responded to him and we removed his  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3756) grief from him  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3758) what meaning and just like that we  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3760) respond to the believers that means it  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3762) becomes an example for us but the  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3764) prophet says that and even tamiya even  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3766) though he has a shortly sadda on just  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3768) this dua just the dua yeah  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3770) and the in light of the hadith when the  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3772) prophet says that when anyone any one of  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3775) you makes dua let him pray with the  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3777) prayer of you and salisa because no  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3779) muslim prays with that prayer except  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3781) allah answers allah responds to him  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3783) because that that key that third part is  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3786) key just like that we respond to  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3788) believers now the other verse in the  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3789) quran concerning his  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3790) islam allah says  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3795) if he was not this is very clear if he  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3798) was not  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3799) of the muslim  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3800) of those who always were for allah he  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3802) would have remained in the belly of the  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3804) will until yamako yama until the end of  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3806) time  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3807) so that means that means  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3809) you know something was  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3811) very helpful for eunice al-islam at a  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3814) time where he needed the most  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3816) his liquor his test be his remembrance  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3819) of allah is take far and as if he was  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3821) not like that before even it would  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3824) remain in the valley of the fish until  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3825) the end of time therefore never  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3827) undermine the good you do today because  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3829) it could come a time tomorrow where you  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3832) would need that the most the prophet  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3833) hadith says  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3835) no allah  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3840) so if you're with allah when things are  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3842) easy for you in life you have some money  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3843) in your pockets you have some clothes  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3845) the weather is good everything's fine  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3847) remember allah more remember allah more  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3849) pray to allah more do try and do more  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3852) give sadaqa more because when  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3854) you have a difficult day you'd find  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3856) allah allah is closer to you and allah  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3857) will aid you so i think that on the one  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3860) hand you don't want to fall victim to  
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3862) shaytaan because shaytan encourages  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3864) hopelessness and you could find for  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3865) example i could give dawah and no  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3868) results and shiitake would say you know  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3870) what forget it it's a it's an end game  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3872) ain't gonna happen let somebody else do  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3874) it let him you know and then this is  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3876) shaytanic because this is this is a way  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3877) of discouraging you from doing a good  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3879) deed you should do with by the way you  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3881) know when the prophet says in the hadith  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3883) your actions won't save you he says  
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3889) means be  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3890) mudra i mean be  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3892) you know like  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3893) pace yourself in in an easy way like  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3896) don't be  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3898) don't over burden yourself and and even  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3900) the raja mentions variation of the  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3901) hadith what he says one of them is in  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3903) the hadith this deen is easy and nobody  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3907) makes it hard on himself except that it  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3908) overcomes him it overtakes him because  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3910) he's made it too excessively hard upon  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3912) himself so first give yourself realistic  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3915) targets and goals if for example you're  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3917) going to say  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3919) maybe i was doing dawah in x y and z way  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3923) maybe i can kind of change my strategy a  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3925) bit ask allah for aids and assistance  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3927) and do it in a way that because the  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3929) prophet says allah loves what is  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3930) continuous even if it's small so if  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3933) you're doing something continuous even  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3935) if it's a small thing is better than  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3936) doing a big thing only once and then  
[1:05:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3939) that's the end of the affair so maybe  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3940) sometimes we do it the wrong way maybe  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3942) we do the big thing run out of steam  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3945) burn out and uh we think there's nothing  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3947) going to happen whereas the one who is  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3949) patiently persevering in his dawah even  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3952) if it's slow will have better results at  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3955) the end of it and then he will always  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3956) feel better in himself as well  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3959) so this is this is consistency and is  
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3962) the karma and now but to summarize what  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3964) you said which is very moving and  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3966) beautiful so  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3967) if when we hit rock bottom in the tower  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3969) so one important thing to do is to  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3972) basically just  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3974) obviously with a heartfelt supplication  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3977) the supplication  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3978) of yunus alaihissalam there is no deity  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3981) except you exalted are you indeed i have  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3984) been of the wrongdoers  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3987) but also in making this dua we must  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3989) become this dua  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3991) and what's really fascinating when you  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3993) were talking about this what came to  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3994) mind is when we do hit rock bottom or we  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3997) do basically  
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=3999) we face hurdles and obstacles and and  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4001) self-inflicted errors if you like  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4004) go back to tawheed remember this is all  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4007) about allah subhanahu wa tower  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4009) my tower is basically an expression of a  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4013) timeless  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4014) fact that allah is worthy of extensive  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4017) praise ultimate gratitude he's worthy of  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4020) all worship he's the only deity worthy  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4021) of worship so go back to allah subhanahu  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4024) wa remember why you're doing it in the  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4025) first place this is just an expression  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4028) of why allah is worthy of worship which  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4030) is the the the the  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4034) truest truth if you like yeah  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4036) and then praise allah as a result  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4038) because remember the  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4040) dua is uh there is no date except you  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4042) exalted or you so then praise allah  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4045) subhanahu wa ta'ala you know you know  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4048) subhan allah he is he is transcendent he  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4052) is beyond anything uh in in our  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4054) imagination uh praise allah extensively  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4058) praise allah because praise as we know  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4059) in um kitab surah  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4062) is actually one of the keys of worship  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4063) praise and gratitude we say  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4065) alhamdulillah  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4067) all perfect praise and gratitude belong  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4069) to the lord of everything that exists  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4071) and um kitab is a summary of the whole  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4073) of the quran and the summary of the  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4074) whole of the quran is tawheed itself so  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4077) that so once you remember this is about  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4079) worshipping allah remembering who allah  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4081) is then praise him and then  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4084) we we we ask allah for forgiveness that  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4087) we have transgressed it's because of our  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4089) transgressions but that should also mean  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4091) that you realize what those  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4092) transgressions are because humiliation  
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4095) in the tower or hitting rock bottom or  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4097) basically moving away from the taoist  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4099) scene or feeling disenhartened it could  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4102) be as a result of some things that you  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4104) have missed out in your own life it  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4106) could be  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4107) it could be the fact that you have a job  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4109) it could be it could be a whole range of  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4111) things so the very fact you're admitting  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4114) that you're the wrong doer means that  
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4115) you understand that wrong some  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4116) wrongdoing has been done so you should  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4118) do some kind of self-reflection to find  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4120) out what on earth has happened what did  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4122) i do what was going on and you know i  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4125) see this so this in my life i went  
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4126) through crazy humiliation in the dawah  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4128) which now i remember one shaykh said to  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4130) me on the day of judgement you're gonna  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4132) wish that this happened to you a  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4133) thousand times  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4136) if it wasn't for that  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4139) i don't think i've ever spoken too much  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4141) publicly about it but  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4143) i was like almost suicidal  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4147) [Music]  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4150) and that created uh a sense of awareness  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4153) that there's some stuff inside me that  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4156) needs to be fixed and it was one of the  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4157) greatest gifts allah has given  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4160) after that i finished my book then i  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4163) became ceo of  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4165) so many different things  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4166) and if i was in the same state before  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4169) that humiliation  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4170) all of this would have been a calamity  
[1:09:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4172) for me  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4173) and the way and the way it happened i'm  
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4175) telling you it was it was transformative  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4177) beyond anything and you know for the art  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4180) and for someone like me who's maybe you  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4182) know arrogant and stuff you know no one  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4184) else could deal with me apart from allah  
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4186) only allah could teach me this yet  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4188) because in other human beings maybe it  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4189) wasn't enough allah had to give me that  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4191) shake  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4192) um and it was profound it was absolutely  
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4195) profound so it helped me recognize  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4197) within myself what has been missing  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4204) what is this all about this is not about  
[1:10:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4205) you this is about yours  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4207) you know if says that  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4209) whenever you find a loss in your affairs  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4212) he says  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4214) begin to make sugar because  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4218) if you think allah allah would increase  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4220) you now allah doesn't say what is going  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4222) to increase you in by the way yeah  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4224) but there's going to be increase in you  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4227) from shukra of allah so more gratitude  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4229) to him subhanallah and it could be for  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4232) example sometimes  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4234) and it's like you know it's been a it's  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4236) a  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4236) i don't know that even we you know may  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4238) allah have mercy on sheikh muhammad who  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4241) passed away just yesterday  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4246) i mean growing up of course he was a big  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4247) inspiration for all of us because he was  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4250) you know we had all of his talks and  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4251) everything else subhanallah but you know  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4253) the day before  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4255) he  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4255) therefore yesterday my wife's mother  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4258) passed away the day before  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4261) the way my friend's father passed away  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4263) you know and so and then there's  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4265) there's been so many deaths around us  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4268) subhanallah and it's a reminder of  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4270) course but one of the things that i've  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4272) really taken  
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4274) i mean i think that we've really  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4275) benefited as a community in fact from  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4277) this is the fact that  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4279) so my father my friend's father passed  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4281) away  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4282) uh you know he had a stroke he was  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4284) paralyzed he couldn't talk he couldn't  
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4286) talk

[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4302) couldn't even talk before and so  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4305) yeah on the day he dies

[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4321) iman until he then and he said that and  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4324) it was like a sense of uh you know his  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4327) gratitude even through loss  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4330) like you know our friend from  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4332) previously omar sorry my very close  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4334) friend whose whose son was stabbed to  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4335) death of the aziz uh  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4338) likewise i mean it was a similar thing  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4339) because when he when he when he died  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4341) when he was when they heard when he  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4342) heard the news that he'd been stabbed to  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4344) death  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4344) uh his mom who didn't know anything  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4347) because she thought maybe were involved  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4349) in an accident or something and when her  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4351) brother went to break the news to her in  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4353) the night at the home  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4355) and had to kind of break that news to  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4356) her imagine that the feeling of her  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4358) mother he said the first thing she did  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4360) is she made she made sajdah  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4363) she made such a to allah and even omar  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4366) who was in hospital said that you know  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4368) the first that they did that they went  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4369) to make wudu in the in the bathroom  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4372) and they prayed salah and it's like the  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4375) the the allah mentions that you know  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4377) with iman comes anor becomes a light you  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4379) see comes a light and that light  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4382) it's something that know you can't find  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4384) anywhere else because the way that you  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4386) conceptualize shukra now isn't just  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4388) shukra as in shakir it's in shakur so  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4392) you have the shakira and shakur when  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4393) wasallam was praying the whole night and  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4395) aye she said ya rasulallah why do you do  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4396) that when allah has just forgiven  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4398) everything and he said to affleck  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4401) and should i not be then a truly  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4403) grateful son of allah meaning in all  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4405) situations being grateful to him this is  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4407) why ibrahim says that the  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4414) for the things are like uh present for  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4416) him in his life and things and stuff and  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4418) the shakur thanks allah for what's just  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4420) missing in his life you know at shaku  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4422) and shaky thanks allah for blessings and  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4424) shakur thanks allah for the calamities  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4426) because like you mentioned that calamity  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4428) the nicoma became enigma the calamity  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4431) becomes a blessing so that's the way  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4434) because the person on their faith when  
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4436) he was  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4437) you know underwent so much difficulty  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4438) the hardship of his life and  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4440) because of the expectation maybe they  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4442) would listen to him like the mecca to  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4443) listen to him they said  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4447) this is humility oh allah i complain to  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4449) you for the weakness of my strength you  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4451) know  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4453) the  
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4454) minimum nature of my resources and and  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4457) i'm not important in the eyes of the  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4458) people  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4460) they don't think i'm important but then  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4462) he says well i can if you don't if  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4463) you're not angry with me then i don't  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4465) mind what's going to happen to me or  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4466) allah i mean that's that's the key thing  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4468) and so uh the beautiful thing is as i i  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4471) mentioned  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4472) to umar i said look at the example of  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4474) aurora because otherwise the example is  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4477) he had four kids you know and the khalif  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4480) invites him to damascus he goes to  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4481) damascus  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4482) one of his kids was playing in the in  
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4484) the stable with the horses and the horse  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4486) kicks his son and the son dies  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4488) and so orwell now has to prepare the  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4489) funeral for his son and he washed the  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4492) body and prepared the funeral and while  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4494) he's doing that i think digging the  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4495) grave he he injures himself and then his  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4498) leg becomes infected  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4500) and the doctors say you have to have it  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4502) amputated and so he had to have his leg  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4504) cut off and then the people said the  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4506) aura they said after a few days they  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4508) said you know we're so sad because first  
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4509) you must use your son then you lose your  
[1:15:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4511) limb  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4512) and then he said he's very beautiful  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4513) words he says look allah gave me  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4516) baby allah gave me four sons and allah  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4519) took one but allah left three for that i  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4520) praise allah  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4522) and allah gave me four limbs two arms  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4524) two legs allah took one and i left three  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4526) for that i praise allah whenever allah  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4527) took something from allah left a lot  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4529) back for me you know and it's just as a  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4531) perspective so you have allah gives even  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4534) opportunities for people to really show  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4537) the most remarkable sugar uh in the most  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4540) difficult situation subhanallah and  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4542) that's that's just that's something that  
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4544) we we uh you know i i i witnessed that  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4547) myself and what i saw locally in my  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4549) community you know  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4551) and it just goes to show that  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4553) you know if  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4555) we could get consumed by negative events  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4557) and trauma but what islam teaches us  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4559) that we need to understand that the  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4560) meaning that we're giving this trauma is  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4562) not the only meaning that we should give  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4564) the meaning that allah and his messenger  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4566) want us to give and wallahi brothers and  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4568) sisters even especially in our context  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4571) if you give the meaning that allah and  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4573) his messenger want you to have for this  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4575) particular event  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4576) then you're going to transcend that  
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4577) calamity insha allah and we see this  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4580) with  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4580) in in  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4582) and we see this with musa alaihis isn't  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4584) that right the way allah talks to the  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4586) prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4588) gain to  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4589) to attribute a different perspective a  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4591) different meaning to his life and to  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4593) certain issues in order for him to  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4594) transcend those issues correct  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4596) subhanallah yesterday one of the because  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4599) i do thursday three hours of mentoring  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4601) and one of the guys  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4603) who said brother i feel so low in my  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4605) life i don't know what to do with  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4606) anything he was just so depressed with  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4608) everything and so i mentioned  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4610) to him and i said look when allah means  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4613) it was at a time in the prophet's life  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4616) when the muslim began to insult him make  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4618) fun because the first verses were  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4620) revealed and it was a gap in revelation  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4621) that we can say like what  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4623) is lord is abandoned what is abandoned  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4624) him and allah reveals  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4626) begins by saying well doha by the early  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4629) morning brightness  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4631) meaning there's always like it connotes  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4633) has imagery of newness freshness new  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4636) beginning new chance new opportunity new  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4638) beginning new things could happen no two  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4640) days are the same in the life of any son  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4642) of adam every day is a unique day when  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4644) laylee either  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4645) which means you're the kenneth sakin and  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4646) when the night is still  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4648) like that like the stillness of the sea  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4651) that to the still dark night silent  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4654) night and the early morning brightness  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4656) your lord hasn't abandoned you nor does  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4657) he scorn you and what is yet to come for  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4660) tomorrow's story for you will outstrip  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4663) is better for you than we have today and  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4665) you'll be pleased with that then allah  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4667) says i let me dedicate a team and  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4669) so i said to brother i said look i said  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4671) you you can't fix it only on today you  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4674) have to think about your yesterdays  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4676) that's the lesson in  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4677) allah says didn't we find you an orphan  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4679) and sheltered you and found you poor and  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4682) enriched you and found you wandering and  
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4684) guided you meaning  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4685) you know who was looking after you when  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4688) things were good for you in your life  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4689) when things were you know when you were  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4691) in difficulty but allah aid and assisted  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4693) you and then comes kind of a social  
[1:18:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4695) responsibility like empathy building  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4698) because there's going to be people you  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4700) encounter in life who will be in like in  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4702) your situation before  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4704) foreign  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4708) as for the orphan don't be cruel as for  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4711) the one that comes to ask you don't push  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4712) him back and even kathir says it means  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4716) what could you  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4717) remember when you were an orphan  
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4719) what could the remember when you  
[1:18:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4721) were poor meaning have that sense of  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4722) empathy for other people and i think  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4724) that that's a powerful thing so  
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4725) therefore you know we gain a lot of ins  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4727) we can you should gain a little  
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4728) inspiration from the quran i mean from  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4730) all these prophetic examples and stories  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4733) and the seerah and the sunnah because  
[1:18:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4735) that's really what gives us life as  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4737) muslims and how else do we navigate the  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4739) trudges and sludges of life sometimes of  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4741) course things happen in life  
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4742) unpredictable we weren't expecting them  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4745) they can be difficult  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4746) but but if we if we navigate through  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4749) life you know with these kind of uh uh  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4751) you know positive  
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4753) reinforcements then they will kind of  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4755) build us i think inshallah in in good  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4757) ways and i said that's uh something i  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4759) think for the da i mean for all of us in  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4761) charlotte hoping to be duart  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4763) remember therefore the importance of our  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4766) connection with allah subhanahu wa  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4767) ta'ala is of the this of the prime is a  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4770) primary thing you know the way that you  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4772) are with allah will detect everything  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4775) and and you're not looking for successes  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4778) only in this life you want the success  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4781) in the next life i mean that's the big  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4782) thing and it could be even if you have  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4785) delayed successes in this life all  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4788) prophets went through that so that's  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4789) what i mean the prophets were bigger  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4790) than us bad at us chosen by allah and  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4793) they had they had these delays and stuff  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4795) and look how bani israel went on there  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4798) went back to worshiping the carving oh  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4800) musa had to struggle with all these  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4802) people  
[1:20:03](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4803) but allah still says to musa speak to  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4805) pharaoh in a soft word maybe his heart  
[1:20:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4807) might might be reflected and so  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4809) therefore the message is convey the  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4811) message as best as you can with guidance  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4813) with vasira with with with insight and  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4816) wisdom and with knowledge and with  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4818) courage and all these things and then  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4820) leave your affairs to allah subhanahu wa  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4821) ta'ala and you know when allah guides  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4824) even katherine says i think al qurtabi  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4826) says because i mentioned in the book he  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4828) says that the one allah guides is one  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4830) who is mr one who is deserving of the  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4832) guidance so you don't know who's  
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4833) deserving of the gun because only allah  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4835) knows who's deserving  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4836) why would you beat yourself over if  
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4838) allah knows who's  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4840) so therefore the it's a big blessing if  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4842) allah has afforded you  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4844) that the time the chance the in life to  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4847) do something to convey this beautiful  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4850) deen unto other people and in the course  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4852) of that to make you more mindful of him  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4855) and in his remembrance that's  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4857) the the biggest gift i think allah has  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4859) given a person in his life so therefore  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4862) may allah make us appreciative humble  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4864) and grateful to him and patient in our  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4867) affairs  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4870) so just to complete this podcast i think  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4873) just to summarize what you've said you  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4875) know when we go through these laws  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4877) actually you know stand in the  
[1:21:19](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4879) possibility that the meaning you're  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4880) giving is not the right meaning and what  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4882) the meaning that allah is giving it and  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4884) the meaning that the prophet salallahu  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4886) wasallam is the correct meaning i hope  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4888) you transcend these calamities and these  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4890) problems  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4891) and  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4892) so with that being said there is so much  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4894) more we could talk about of course  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4896) there's so much more we will talk about  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=4898) in the future in future podcasts

[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=5029) as well it's always going to be an  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/__NpvDxDSlw?t=5030) infinite regress of gratitude
