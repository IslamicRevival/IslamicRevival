Those who repent and believe in Allah will have their sins forgiven and will have their evil deeds turned into good deeds.

It explains that the human being must be treated as a transcendent, unique creator and sustainer of everything, and that all acts of worship should be directed towards Allah alone. This is important when sharing Islam with people, as it helps to connect them with the religion on a deeper level.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=300)** explains that in order to effectively share Islam with others, we must first understand who the human being is. He goes on to say that this is missing in today's dhawa discourse, and that we must be sincere in our commitment to the goodness and guidance of all people. He also notes that this is in line with western cognitive science, as people think that they are rational but in reality are motivated by non-rational factors.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=600)** The seminar discusses the concept of everyone worshipping, ultimately concluding that Allah is the only deity worthy of devotion.

The presenter gives an approach to unclouding the fitra which is spirituality. This is one opinion of the fitra, and there is another opinion that it has no knowledge. The presenter pulls this together to make the point that there are different ways to uncloud the fitra to awaken the truth within. This is a key approach to the quran and the anbiya. Successful Dawah will be based on using different approaches together to engage with the human being.

### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=3600) - [01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=6000)

\**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=3600)* explains how people can become devoted to extreme nationalism, and how this devotion can distort one's moral vision. He also discusses how this devotion can be represented by various aspects of one's life, such as obedience to nationalistic leaders, extensive praise of nationalistic symbols, and love of nationalism itself.

*   **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=3900)** This lecture explores the idea that everyone worships something, and that Allah is the most worthy of our devotion.

*   **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=4200)** Allah is worthy of worship because he is the only deity, and he has said that he is God. Praising Allah by virtue of his attributes (such as eloquence or football skills) is acceptable. If someone isn't interested in poetry or football, they can still praise Allah by virtue of his role as the Creator of the universe.
*   \**[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=4500)* Discusses how everyone worships, focusing on how Allah is worthy of our devotion due to his perfect attributes and gifts, without any deficiency or flow. The first point is that Allah is worthy of worship by virtue of who he is- essentially, it's his right to worship. The second point is that all life is provided for us by Allah, including our conscious moments. The third point is that Allah provides us with innumerable blessings, including the gift of life. discusses a thought experiment in which someone tries to count all the blessings Allah has given them, and eventually gives up. This example is from early pious scholars, and applies to anyone who suffers or has a difficult life.
*   \**[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=4800)* Discusses the concepts of worship, gratitude, and self-love, and how they relate to one another. He says that if one loves oneself, then one should also love Allah. Al-Ghazali discusses this in his work "Ihea."
*   **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=5100)** The presenter discusses why Allah is worthy of worship, citing five reasons: because everything happens according to Allah's will, Allah is the most loving, all of Allah's names and attributes are perfect, we are natural born worshippers, and Allah is the soul and creator of the universe. The presenter suggests that if someone is naturally drawn to worship something, Allah is that something.
*   **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=5400)** The presenter discusses why Allah is worthy of worship, discussing that we're born to worship, that obedience to Allah is the most rational thing to do, and that it's irrational not to obey Allah. He also explains the epistemology of testimony, concluding that because Allah is the ultimate authority, we must obey him.
*   **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6pO6OrWD8E\&t=5700)** explains that everyone worships Allah because He is the source of all goodness, and that atheism and idol worship are both forms of shirk (associationism). The Islamic spiritual tradition teaches that rejecting or giving Allah's attributes to something else is a form of idol worship.

[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=35) spending some time with you today\
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=37) to articulate a very powerful approach\
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=40) to sharing islam intellectually and\
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=44) academically\
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=46) and when we talk about intellectually\
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=48) and academically sharing islam\
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=51) it's not only talking about theo\
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=53) philosophical issues\
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=54) it's not only talking about abstract\
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=57) deductive\
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=58) arguments or abstract philosophical\
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=60) arguments\
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=61) but rather if you study the quran\
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=64) if you study the book of allah subhanahu\
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=66) wa ta'ala or rather when we study\
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=68) the book of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=71) and we study\
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=72) the sunnah of our beloved prophet\
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=73) sallallahu alaihi wasallam\
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=76) and we study the way of our spiritual\
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=79) masters our early scholars\
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=81) the classical tradition we will\
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=83) understand\
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=85) that sharing islam is quite broad\
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=89) meaning that there are different ways to\
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=92) engage with the human being\
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=93) there are different means to uncloud\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=98) the innate disposition of the human\
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=99) being i'm going to explain what that\
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=101) means in a few moments\
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=103) now what i'm trying to say here is that\
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=106) it's also very important to use\
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=109) spiritual arguments or\
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=110) existential arguments or an existential\
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=113) approach\
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=114) or a phenomenological approach\
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=117) really tapping into people's real world\
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=120) experiences\
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=121) and getting people to understand their\
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=123) real world experiences\
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=125) and to engage with them in that way\
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=129) and it becomes far more powerful\
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=132) and hopefully by the end of today's\
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=134) session you will understand\
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=136) that this approach that we're going to\
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=137) take today is one of many approaches\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=140) within the broad spectrum of sharing\
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=142) islam according to the quran the sunnah\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=144) pious predecessors are pious spiritual\
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=147) masters if you like\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=148) and you're going to find it quite\
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=150) powerful insha allah so\
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=153) what are we going to cover today the\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=155) first thing that we're going to cover\
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=156) is spend a few moments on speaking about\
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=159) the kind of metaphysical backdrop\
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=161) in other words what is\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=164) the metaphysics in the islamic tradition\
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=167) concerning\
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=168) the human being what is the human\
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=171) and this is very significant in the\
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=173) context of any type of dawah any type of\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=176) sharing islam\
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=177) whether it's intellectually or\
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=178) academically otherwise because\
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=181) we are calling a human being to\
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=184) the way of allah meaning the fact that\
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=188) allah\
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=188) is worthy of worship that we must single\
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=191) out and direct\
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=192) all of our internal and external acts of\
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=195) worship to allah alone\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=196) and we must recognize him we must\
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=199) understand\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=200) that he is the sole transcendent unique\
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=203) creator maintainer sustainer of\
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=205) everything that exists\
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=207) and he is worthy of our utmost gratitude\
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=209) and extensive praise\
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=212) so this is very significant because when\
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=216) we're sharing islam\
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=218) and we're speaking to the human being\
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=219) and we're telling the human being\
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=221) to follow the way of\
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=225) wa to allah as allah says in the quran\
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=227) called to the way of allah\
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=229) we need to understand not only who allah\
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=231) is as well which we're going to talk\
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=232) about today of course but we have to\
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=233) understand what is the human being\
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=236) because if we treat the human being as\
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=238) other than the human being\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=240) then we're not really engaging with the\
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=242) human being in an effective way\
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=243) so if we're treating the human being for\
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=245) example as some kind of\
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=248) artificial intelligence machine that\
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=250) we're treating the human being\
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=252) as an abstract\
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=255) ai machine we're treating the human\
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=257) being\
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=258) as a kind of functional model of the\
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=260) mind because in the philosophy of the\
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=262) mind\
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=263) functionalism is generally speaking in\
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=265) simplistic terms based on\
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=267) inputs mental states and outputs there's\
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=269) a relation between\
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=270) inputs mental states and outputs so are\
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=273) we treating the human being\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=274) as a just a functionalist model of the\
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=276) mind that would just give\
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=278) the human being some input and we're\
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=280) going to expect some kind of output\
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=281) right we're going to give some kind of\
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=283) dawah algorithm\
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=285) and then we're going to expect some\
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=287) positive change we're going to expect\
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=289) them to basically\
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=290) accept islam this is the wrong approach\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=294) and this will betray the human being\
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=297) other than the human being is so what's\
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=300) very important when we're talking about\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=302) sharing islam intellectually and\
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=303) academically\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=304) otherwise we have to know who the human\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=307) being is\
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=308) in order to effectively deal with the\
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=310) human being\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=311) in order for us to share islam\
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=315) effectively\
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=315) because we have to be sincere to allah\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=317) subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=319) and we have to be sincere to the human\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=321) being because as you know\
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=322) and i repeat this a lot in the islamic\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=324) tradition based on various\
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=326) hadith various prophetic traditions\
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=329) and even based on the quran as well when\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=332) allah says that the prophet saw was sent\
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=333) as a rahmah\
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=334) as a mercy to all the worlds to\
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=337) everything\
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=338) also the prophetic teachings of the\
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=339) prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi\
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=341) wasallam when he said as noted by\
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=343) bukhari in tariq al-qaeda and this is a\
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=346) authentic hadith\
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=347) that you must love for humanity love for\
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=350) li nes that's the arabic lin-ness for\
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=352) the people for humanity\
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=354) what you love for yourself and we have\
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=356) the other prophetic tradition\
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=357) which was collected by the famous\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=360) scholar and nawawi\
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=361) in his arabian in his 40 hadith 40\
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=364) ahadith 40 prophetic traditions it's the\
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=367) 13th hadith\
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=369) and the prophet sallallahu alaihi\
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=370) wasallam says\
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=375) you won't truly believe unless you love\
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=377) for your brother or your love for\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=378) yourself\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=378) and now we he comments on this prophetic\
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=381) tradition he said this also means\
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=383) your brother and sister in humanity and\
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=385) what does it mean to love for others\
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=387) what we love for ourselves\
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=388) what does it mean to to\
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=391) love for humanity what we love for\
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=392) ourselves it basically means that we\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=394) must be committed to the goodness\
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=396) and guidance of all people and this is\
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=398) exactly what i know and now we were\
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=399) saying\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=400) and even the maliki scholar\
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=404) he says something very similar we must\
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=406) be committed to the well-being\
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=408) to the goodness and guidance of all\
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=409) people this is the prophetic approach\
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=412) this is the islamic approach so if we're\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=414) sincere to allah say to people\
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=416) we must be sincere in the commitment to\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=419) their well-being\
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=420) and if we're sincere in the commitment\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=422) to their well-being which means goodness\
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=424) and guidance\
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=425) then when we're talking to them about\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=426) islam we have to do it in the most\
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=429) sincere way\
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=430) so it means we can't treat them as some\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=432) kind of functionist model of the mind\
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=434) we can't treat them as some kind of\
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=437) abstract ai\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=438) machine that was going to type in some\
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=439) kind of rational argument some kind of\
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=441) algorithm\
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=442) and we're going to get some type of\
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=443) results and this is why\
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=445) it's very important in\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=448) any context concerning the tao of\
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=450) concerning sharing islam\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=452) is that we understand who the human\
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=454) being is\
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=455) because that's missing really in our\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=457) dhawa discourse that's missing\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=459) in our discourse today what is the human\
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=462) being because we\
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=463) in some ways we presume\
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=466) that the human being is some kind of\
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=468) function this model of the mind some\
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=470) kind of\
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=470) abstract artificial intelligence entity\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=473) and we're just going to give them some\
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=474) kind of\
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=474) you know robust feel philosophical\
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=476) argument expecting results\
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=478) but that's a very in due respect an\
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=480) intellectually pathetic\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=482) approach to the human being why because\
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=486) allah who created the human being knows\
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=488) the human being\
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=489) better than we know the human being and\
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=491) allah is telling us that's not the human\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=492) being\
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=494) so obviously i'm not going to get into\
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=495) like islamic psychology or islamic kind\
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=498) of\
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=498) metaphysics concerning what is the human\
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=501) but the human\
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=502) as allah says in the sunnah talks about\
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=504) various things\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=506) and the human is a roar has a soul\
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=511) has a pub has a heart and remember the\
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=513) heart does\
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=514) it wavers and a\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=518) function of the heart according to the\
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=519) ulama according to the scholars\
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=521) is the aqua is the intellect right it's\
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=523) a function of the heart\
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=525) then we have the nafs the kind of ego or\
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=527) psychological disposition\
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=529) and we have the fitra the kind of\
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=531) normative\
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=532) original state of the human being\
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=536) and all of these things are in the\
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=538) dynamic interplay\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=540) so we have to appreciate this and once\
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=543) we appreciate this\
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=545) then we'll be in a better position to\
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=547) understand like\
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=548) how do i how do i express that\
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=550) commitment to the goodness and guidance\
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=553) in their context meaning how am i gonna\
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=556) convey to them the message of islam and\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=559) treat them\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=559) as they should be treated as a human\
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=562) being\
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=562) rather than some kind of abstract\
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=565) artificial intelligence\
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=566) machine and by the way what we're going\
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=568) to talk about is so in line with western\
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=570) cognitive science anyway\
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=571) from the perspective of that people\
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=573) think that you know they're rational\
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=574) but in reality you know the kind of\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=577) rational or intellectual positions are\
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=579) motivated by non-rational fact such as\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=583) psychological\
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=584) and and otherwise anyway i don't do that\
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=586) too much\
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=599) \[Music]\
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=601) obey him and to direct all acts of\
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=604) worship the internal acts of worship and\
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=606) the external action\
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=609) then we're going to talk about the\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=610) concept of everyone worships because if\
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=612) you universalize the kind of underlying\
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=614) logic\
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=615) of the concept of worship you're going\
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=617) to really understand that even if\
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=618) someone rejects god even if someone's an\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=620) atheist\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=620) they actually worship something and\
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=622) we're going to give an example of\
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=624) extreme nationalism\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=625) to basically highlight this point and\
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=627) then we're going to\
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=629) once you talk to human beings in this\
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=631) way and you ask these questions\
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=633) concerning you know worship and you ask\
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=636) the particular\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=637) which we're going to unpack in a few\
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=638) moments inshallah concerning this\
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=641) topic it's going to create some kind of\
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=645) spiritual and existential vacuum if you\
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=647) like because they're going to be like oh\
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=648) my god yes i actually do worship\
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=650) something\
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=651) and it's going to raise something's\
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=653) going to raise in their minds and\
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=654) they're going to think well\
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=656) is that thing that i'm worshiping\
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=658) actually worthy of worship\
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=660) and then that's when we introduced the\
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=661) fact that allah is the only deity worthy\
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=663) of worship\
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=664) and i'm going to give you seven\
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=665) perspectives or seven approaches or\
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=667) seven arguments\
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=668) of why allah is worthy of worship and\
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=670) then we're gonna deal with some\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=671) objections and go into questions so\
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=673) hopefully this is clear\
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=675) so awakening the truth within\
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=679) there's a few things we need to\
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=680) understand brothers and sisters we\
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=681) already spoke about\
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=682) at length it was supposed to be\
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=684) introduction but concerning the\
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=685) metaphysics of the human\
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=688) when we're giving dao when we're sharing\
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=690) islam intellectually and academically\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=692) we are actually talking to a human being\
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=694) we're inviting their human being to\
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=695) allah\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=698) so in order to effectively invite the\
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=700) human being to the way of allah\
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=702) the fact that he is worthy of worship\
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=705) we have to treat the human being and\
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=707) understand the human being as the human\
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=709) being is\
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=710) and not in any other way and therefore\
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=713) we should raise the question well what\
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=715) is the human being\
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=716) and that should make us realize that\
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=718) maybe our current understanding is\
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=719) completely wrong\
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=720) because a lot of people think the human\
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=722) being is this kind of abstract intellect\
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=724) right\
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=724) which is fundamentally flawed because\
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=727) the human being\
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=728) is not that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=730) talks about the human being\
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=732) has a hazard it does\
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=735) wavers the heart the spiritual heart\
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=737) wavers then we have an alkaline\
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=740) intellect which is not an abstract thing\
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=741) but rather it's a function of the kalb\
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=744) right and this is very interesting\
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=746) because we know even even when someone's\
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=748) super intelligent\
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=749) and their great philosophy if you like\
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=750) and they're really intelligent they may\
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=752) still not accept islam\
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=754) why because the the intellect is a\
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=757) function of the kaab is a function of\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=759) the heart\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=759) and the heart can be diseased with\
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=761) spiritual diseases such as kibber\
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=763) such as arrogance and arrogance will\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=765) basically not allow the occult to\
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=767) function properly within that dynamic\
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=769) right it's very very very significant\
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=772) right\
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=773) so anyway come back to the point you\
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=775) have an aqua which is the function of\
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=777) the heart then you have\
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=778) the nafs the ego the psychological\
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=780) disposition then you have the fitrah\
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=782) and all of these these things are a\
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=783) dynamic interplay now i'm not here to\
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=785) basically claim i know how that works\
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=787) in totality no but i just want to give\
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=789) you some advice in the context of\
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=791) sharing islam in order for us to be a\
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=792) little bit more elevated in our\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=794) discourse\
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=795) and be more effective in our tower and\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=796) fundamentally being\
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=798) do things that are more pleasing to\
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=800) allah because\
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=801) if we're sincere to allah we're sincere\
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=803) to the human being we're committed to\
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=805) the goodness and guidance\
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=806) then basically we should do things that\
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=809) are in line with\
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=810) what with allah's guidance right\
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=812) irrespective of success\
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=814) because success comes from allah\
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=815) subhanahu wa ta'ala but even in saying\
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=817) that\
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=818) when you're closer to guidance you're\
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=820) gonna get success\
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=821) the true concept of success not limited\
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=824) numbers in the next two three months or\
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=826) even two three decades\
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=827) but rather continuing even after your\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=830) death\
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=831) and that so if you're closest to\
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=832) guidance you're always going to be more\
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=834) successful\
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=834) so coming back to the point when we zoom\
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=836) into the fit from the context of sharing\
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=838) islam intellection academically\
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=840) there are two main opinions concerning\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=842) the fitra the fitra is the kind of\
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=844) normative original state it's the innate\
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=846) disposition\
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=847) the normative original innate\
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=848) disposition of the human being\
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=850) and we know this from the quran in\
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=853) chapter 30\
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=854) verse 30 we know this from the hadith of\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=856) the prophet sallallahu alaihi\
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=858) wasallam that's in muslim in the\
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=860) authentic hadith\
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=862) narrated by by muslim and\
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=866) the concept of the fitra is very\
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=867) interesting because in the islamic\
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=868) intellectual tradition and by the way\
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=870) i'm not here to unpack the whole\
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=871) tradition here we've mentioned this in\
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=873) other\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=874) seminars and webinars i'm not going to\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=876) unpack it too much here but generally\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=878) speaking there are two main opinions\
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=879) concerning the fitra\
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=881) yes it's the normative original innate\
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=883) disposition\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=885) however there are two main opinions one\
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=887) opinion is\
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=888) that the fitra has some type of\
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=891) knowledge within it\
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=892) call it primary knowledge or call it\
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=894) proton knowledge and there is a\
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=895) discussion on what this type of\
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=897) knowledge is\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=898) but the two main elements within the\
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=899) fitrah are that\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=901) allah is worthy of extensive praise\
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=904) worthy of worship and he is a reality\
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=906) right\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=907) and that's within the fitra however as\
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=910) per the prophetic tradition that is\
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=912) authentic\
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=913) the prophet sallallahu talks about\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=916) something happening that the the child\
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=920) or the human being\
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=922) actually somehow doesn't acknowledge\
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=924) that truth within them\
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=926) and as you know inshallah we should know\
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=929) the hadith of the prophet sallallahu\
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=930) alaihi wasallam basically says\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=932) that every child is born in a state of\
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=934) fitra but it's his\
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=935) parents who change him into or make him\
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=938) into a christian a jew or a megan and so\
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=940) on and so forth\
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=941) so the scholars discussed as some kind\
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=944) of\
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=945) veiling or we like to call it a clouding\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=948) over the fitrah\
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=950) so there is this proton knowledge\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=952) primary knowledge within the fitra that\
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=953) allah\
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=954) is worthy of extensive praise he's\
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=956) worthy of worship\
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=957) and that he exists he is a reality but\
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=960) something happens to the fitra because\
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=961) of socialization\
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=963) because of even maybe shubu heart\
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=965) destructive doubts\
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=966) maybe of because of sins because of\
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=968) transgressions\
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=969) it could be a range of things but the\
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=970) point is something happens\
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=972) we like to use the kind of metaphor the\
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=974) clouding of the fitra\
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=976) so the fitra does get clouded\
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=980) and in the context of this first opinion\
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=982) when we said there is a form of primary\
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=983) knowledge within the fitra\
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=985) the fitra gets clouded and therefore\
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=990) they can't see the truth that's already\
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=991) within them\
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=993) so our job as people who like to share\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=996) islam\
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=997) is we need to ask the question how do we\
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=999) uncloud the\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1000) fitra or help uncloud the fitra or\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1003) facilitate that process\
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1004) in order to awaken the truth within this\
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1007) is a very important question\
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1009) and you will realize if you studied the\
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1011) quran the sunnah and the way of the\
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1012) scholars in our classical tradition\
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1014) abstract rational arguments are not just\
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1016) doing it\
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1017) yes that may be one of the means to\
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1020) uncloud the fitra\
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1021) absolutely but i may not\
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1024) and will only realize this if we ask the\
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1027) question if we understand the human\
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1028) being as the human being is\
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1030) and when we and this makes sense of over\
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1032) a thousand years of conversions of\
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1034) people\
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1035) people conveying to islam it makes sense\
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1037) of the quran it makes sense of the\
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1038) sahaba becoming muslim it makes sense\
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1041) of islamic intellectual tradition\
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1043) islamic psychology even makes sense of\
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1045) western cognitive psychology\
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1047) and this is why sometimes when you're in\
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1048) this kind of discussion rational debate\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1051) with someone and it's still not working\
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1052) even though you're intelligent and the\
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1054) person's intelligent\
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1055) but something is not happening that\
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1057) should give an indication that maybe\
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1059) you're using the wrong means to uncloud\
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1061) the fitra maybe they need something else\
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1063) and that's why you're looking at this\
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1065) slide at the moment you have the fitra\
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1067) is clouded\
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1068) and there are different means to uncloud\
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1070) the fitrah yes rational arguments can do\
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1072) the job\
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1073) revelation direct revelation can do the\
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1075) job we have experiences\
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1077) practical real life experiences\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1078) concerning this and this could be\
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1080) considering the quranic beauty the\
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1082) meaning of the verses\
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1083) people pondering over the quran all of\
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1085) these things can become\
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1086) means to uncloud the fitra to awaken the\
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1089) truth within\
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1090) it could be your character your good\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1091) character could be a means to uncloud\
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1093) the fitrah\
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1094) getting them to critically think\
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1096) empowering people to teach them how to\
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1097) critically think\
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1098) could be a means to uncloud the fitra to\
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1100) awaken the truth within and accept the\
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1102) truth\
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1103) it could be experiences getting them to\
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1107) reflect on natural beauty because\
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1109) natural beauty if you attended one of\
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1110) our seminars previously\
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1112) you could find it on our youtube channel\
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1115) talks about natural beauty\
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1116) natural beauty increases all and when\
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1119) someone is\
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1120) has all it basically increases cognitive\
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1122) function\
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1123) and it decreases one's ego and these\
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1126) things are very important in terms of\
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1128) guidance because someone has an ego it's\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1129) a buyer to divine guidance\
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1131) and when someone has heightened\
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1132) cognition they're more likely to accept\
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1134) the truth\
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1135) it's a phenomenal phenomenon and it's\
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1136) based on research by the way it's a\
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1138) phenomenal seminar please attend it\
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1139) it's recorded it's on our youtube\
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1141) channel\
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1142) we could refer to experiences as trauma\
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1145) even positive experience the human\
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1147) or negative experiences human\
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1149) relationships all of these things could\
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1150) be unpacked and we could teach people\
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1152) to stand in the possibility that the\
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1155) meaning that they're giving these\
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1156) experiences\
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1157) may not be the correct meaning and the\
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1159) meaning that they should give those\
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1160) experiences is the meaning\
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1161) that allah wants them to give those\
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1164) experiences\
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1165) that approach itself could be a nissan\
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1166) cloud you don't have to use\
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1169) use all of these in isolation or they're\
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1171) not exclusive\
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1172) you could use them in combination but\
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1175) the point here\
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1176) is if we don't know what the human being\
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1178) is and you don't have this approach\
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1180) and you don't ask the right questions\
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1182) then you're going to be using only one\
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1183) means\
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1185) or you're not going to be intellectually\
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1187) spiritually mature enough\
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1189) to understand when you should shift your\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1192) approach\
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1193) or combine certain ways to try and try\
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1196) and awaken the truth within try to\
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1198) uncloud the fitrah\
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1200) to awaken the truth within and this is a\
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1201) summary we're going to have a\
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1203) in-depth session on just this topic as\
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1205) well but it's very important to\
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1207) highlight even in the beginning of the\
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1208) seminar\
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1209) because what's important is the whole\
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1211) seminar is based on one of the\
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1213) approaches to uncloud the fitra which is\
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1215) spirituality\
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1216) and this whole issue of allah is worthy\
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1219) of worship and showing to humanity\
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1220) allah's worthy of worship\
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1222) and using that in the context of today's\
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1225) seminar\
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1226) that would be an approach to on cloud\
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1228) the fifth route to awaken the truth\
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1230) within and we call it\
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1231) the spiritual approach of spirituality\
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1233) and we're going to obviously unpack it\
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1235) and make you understand what that really\
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1236) is but that could be one way\
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1238) to uncloud the fitness we're not saying\
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1240) this is the only way to give dawah the\
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1242) only approach\
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1243) you could use with a combination of rash\
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1244) with rational arguments\
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1246) with experiences with revelation you\
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1248) could use it on its own\
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1249) depending you know if you listen with\
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1251) the intention to understand the human\
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1253) being\
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1253) and you understand their context because\
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1255) the sunnah the prophetic way\
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1257) of engaging with human beings is to\
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1259) individualize them and understand\
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1261) the the individual context you could\
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1263) understand what the best approach is\
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1266) anyway notwithstanding you know once\
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1268) you've done that then you may realize\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1270) this\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1270) is one of the approaches to use\
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1272) standalone or in combination with the\
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1274) other approaches\
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1275) but obviously we're just going to give\
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1276) you this particular approach in the\
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1278) context of today's seminar\
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1279) so that's one opinion of the fitra the\
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1282) other opinion of the fitra\
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1284) is that it has no knowledge and this is\
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1286) based on the verse in the quran\
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1288) subhan award to allah talks about that\
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1291) the human being when it's born before\
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1294) it's born it didn't know anything it\
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1295) doesn't know anything at all right\
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1297) so there is no knowledge at all within\
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1299) the fitra okay that's another opinion\
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1301) however it's this opinion this classical\
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1305) opinion still understands the fit of to\
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1306) be\
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1307) an original normative innate state or in\
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1309) the original normative\
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1311) natural disposition and instead of it\
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1313) having knowledge\
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1314) it's more of a kind of it's like a\
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1317) vehicle just like in this diagram\
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1320) that directs you towards the truth if\
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1322) it's not clouded\
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1323) and all the other variables are in place\
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1326) then it will direct itself towards the\
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1327) truth\
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1328) however if it's clouded the vehicle the\
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1331) fitrah cannot direct\
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1333) itself towards the truth and similarly\
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1336) to the first opinion\
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1337) there could be different ways to uncloud\
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1339) the fitrah to allow the fitor to direct\
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1341) itself towards the truth\
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1343) these include revelation experiences\
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1345) character rational arguments reflection\
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1347) introspection\
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1348) and introspection critical arguments and\
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1350) of course spirituality which we're going\
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1351) to be using today\
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1354) so how do we pull this to context we'll\
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1356) pull this in context to make you\
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1358) understand that there are different ways\
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1360) different means to uncloud someone's\
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1363) fitrah to awaken the truth within\
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1365) and we can't treat the human being as an\
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1367) abstract artificial intelligence machine\
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1369) as some kind of functionless\
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1370) understanding of the mind in the\
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1371) philosophy of the mind they have this\
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1373) understanding of functionalism which is\
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1375) a particular understanding\
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1377) and it's about inputs mental states and\
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1379) outputs and we just think we're going to\
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1380) give them some kind of input some kind\
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1382) of\
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1382) dollar algorithm and expect certain\
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1384) results that's not the human being and\
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1386) that's why a lot of idawa is not very\
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1388) successful\
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1389) and we're missing the true profound\
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1391) engagement with the human being\
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1393) because if we listen with the intention\
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1395) to understand and we connect with the\
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1397) human human being or we try to connect\
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1399) with the human being\
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1401) as the human being is as we as we've\
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1403) just discussed and we're committed to\
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1404) the well-being which is that we're\
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1406) committed to the goodness and guidance\
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1408) then we're going to stand in the\
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1409) possibility that my approach that i'm\
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1412) currently using\
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1413) is not effective and we need to stand in\
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1415) the possibility that there are other\
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1416) ways of unclouding the fitra\
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1418) in isolation or combination to awaken\
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1421) the truth within to uncloud the fitra\
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1423) to awaken the truth within or if you\
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1424) follow the other opinion and cloud the\
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1426) filter to allow\
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1427) the filter to direct itself towards the\
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1429) truth and this is an\
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1431) elevated understanding of the dao and\
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1432) when someone adopts this their\
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1434) psychology changes\
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1435) their relationships change with the\
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1437) other human being\
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1438) they're more committed in a sincere way\
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1440) to the goodness and guidance\
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1441) they have more effective power and it's\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1444) closer to\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1444) allah's pleasure and and which is\
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1446) allah's guidance right\
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1448) close to allah's guidance therefore\
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1449) closer to allah's pleasure and you'll be\
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1451) far more successful\
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1454) and what we mean by success is success\
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1456) as allah defines it\
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1457) right no are kind of you know abstract\
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1459) numbers and you know i'm going to get\
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1460) this many shahadas\
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1462) yes you're going to be successful in\
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1463) that way as well but true success which\
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1466) outlives our kind of temporary\
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1469) finite lives so\
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1473) yes okay let's pull this together now so\
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1476) yeah so hopefully\
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1476) you've got the point now so this seminar\
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1479) is just discussing\
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1480) one way to uncloud the fitrah to either\
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1483) awaken the truth within\
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1485) or to uncloud the fitra to direct itself\
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1487) towards the truth and that's going to be\
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1489) a key way that allah teaches us in the\
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1492) quran or\
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1493) alludes to and it's the approach of the\
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1496) anbiya\
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1497) because the quranic strategy when it\
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1499) comes and it's not the only strategy by\
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1501) the way\
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1501) but a key strategy and one would argue\
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1504) the central strategy in the quran\
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1507) is to announce allah to mankind\
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1510) is to engage with the human being in\
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1512) such a way to get them to\
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1514) realize that allah is the only deity\
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1516) worthy of worship\
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1518) and that we must direct and single out\
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1520) all our acts of worship to allah alone\
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1522) the internal acts of worship and the\
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1523) external acts of worship\
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1525) and allah says this very clearly in the\
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1528) quran in chapter 21 verse 25\
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1530) and we sent not before you any messenger\
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1533) that we reveal to him that there is no\
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1536) deity except me\
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1537) so worship me meaning\
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1540) that we must worship allah subhanahu wa\
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1542) to allah that we must direct our\
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1545) internal and external acts of worship to\
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1547) allah alone\
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1548) and that obviously includes that we have\
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1550) to affirm his divine oneness\
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1552) and and so on and so forth i'm going to\
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1553) explain that in a few moments\
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1556) and what's interesting is when you look\
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1557) at the quran and you do\
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1559) of the quran you you ponder over the\
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1561) quran which is very important by the way\
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1563) because allah says in the quran\
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1564) do they not ponder over the quran or are\
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1566) there locks on their hearts and you\
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1567) could mirror the meaning here\
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1569) so the more you ponder the more your\
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1572) heart becomes\
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1573) unlocked to receive the guidance and\
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1575) mercy of allah\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1576) so when you ponder on the verses many of\
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1579) these verses that\
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1580) talk about natural phenomena or point\
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1583) you to look at the interconnecting\
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1584) principles of nature\
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1586) you see that they tend to affirm god's\
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1588) creative power\
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1590) his the oneness of his creative power\
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1592) his transcendence his wisdom his power\
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1594) his knowledge\
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1595) his majesty and so on and so forth and\
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1599) that affirmation is there for you\
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1602) to realize just by reflecting\
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1606) on the natural phenomena in order for\
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1610) you to conclude\
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1613) god's divinity allah's divinity the fact\
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1615) that he is worthy of worship\
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1616) so that's the general quranic strategy\
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1619) when there's talking about allah's power\
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1621) majesty the interconnecting principles\
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1622) of nature the sun the moon the orbits\
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1624) the stars and so on and so forth\
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1626) it's there to get you to realize and\
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1628) affirm something that you already know\
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1630) within your fifth\
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1631) if you like if you follow the first\
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1632) opinion or something that's obviously\
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1634) self-evident which is the kind of\
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1636) existence and\
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1638) power of allah for you to affirm this\
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1641) and that will be used as a kind of\
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1643) anchor if you like\
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1645) to conclude and to place yourself\
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1649) intellectually spiritual and spiritually\
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1652) in the understanding that allah is\
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1654) worthy of worship so this this general\
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1656) strategy in the quran concerning\
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1657) natural phenomena or talking about\
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1659) allah's majesty and creative power and\
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1661) transcendence\
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1662) is that you affirm that and that helps\
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1664) you\
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1665) realize that allah is worthy of worship\
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1668) and this is very interesting this is a\
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1670) a key strategy in the quran and the\
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1672) quranic arguments and the quranic\
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1674) strategies are the best strategies\
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1676) because they come from allah\
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1678) so it's time we use them but\
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1680) notwithstanding we've already given you\
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1682) the kind of metaphysical backdrop about\
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1683) the fitra and the clouding and different\
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1685) ways\
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1686) to uncloud the fitrah to either awaken\
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1688) the truth within or\
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1689) to allow the fitzra to direct itself\
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1691) towards the truth we've already spoken\
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1693) about that so this is\
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1694) one of a multiple ways of uncutting the\
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1698) fitra or one\
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1699) means amongst other means to uncloud the\
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1701) fitrah\
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1702) to awaken the truth within but to be\
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1704) honest this is one of my favorite\
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1706) because it applies to everybody whether\
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1708) you believe in allah or not if you you\
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1710) know\
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1711) if you claim to reject him or not it\
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1714) applies to everyone it applies to\
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1715) atheists it applies to christians it\
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1717) applies to non-religious people to\
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1719) humanists and if you do it in the right\
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1721) way you can have an effective powerful\
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1723) discussion\
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1724) and really introduce to people the\
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1726) beauty\
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1727) of allah his beautiful names and\
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1730) attributes the fact that he is worthy of\
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1732) worship\
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1732) and it will be placed in a\
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1734) phenomenological context it will be\
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1735) placed in this kind of experiential\
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1737) context because it's going to refer to\
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1738) their own existence and life\
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1740) because you're going to make them\
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1741) realize that they worship something\
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1743) but they should be worshipping the one\
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1745) that is actually truly worthy of worship\
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1747) allah subhanahu wa that's what we're\
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1749) going to discuss in sha allah\
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1752) so what is worship\
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1755) worship brothers and sisters entitles\
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1757) the following\
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1758) it is to know allah which\
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1762) means to recognize him to have your\
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1764) life's focus on allah subhanahu wa\
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1766) ta'ala\
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1767) and to make allah central to your life\
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1770) and to know\
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1771) allah in terms of getting to know who\
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1774) who he is\
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1775) so this is what it means to know allah\
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1778) so\
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1778) that's an aspect of worship also it's to\
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1781) love allah\
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1783) and loving allah\
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1786) is something extremely important which\
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1788) we're going to unpack when we talk about\
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1789) why allah is worthy of worship\
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1791) but loving allah sometimes is not spoken\
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1793) about much but it should be because this\
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1795) is\
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1796) very central to the islamic tradition\
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1799) because when we say that allah is worthy\
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1801) of worship it actually also means allah\
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1803) is worthy of adoration\
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1805) he is worthy of our love and we must\
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1808) love allah more than anything else\
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1810) which is which echoes the prophetic\
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1812) teachings of the prophet sallallahu\
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1814) alaihi\
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1814) wasallam so worship entails to know\
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1817) allah to love allah\
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1818) and to obey allah now what does that\
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1821) include\
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1822) that that includes to be humble before\
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1824) allah to be humbled before the divine\
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1827) it also means to have positive fear of\
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1830) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1831) obviously there's a difference between\
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1832) positive fear negative fear i don't have\
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1834) to unpack this too much\
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1835) but negative fears that you're afraid of\
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1837) like a monster\
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1838) that's not the type of fear that we have\
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1840) of allah subhanahu wa\
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1841) ta'ala it's more of the type of positive\
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1843) fear that we fear losing the connection\
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1845) with allah\
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1846) we fear losing his pleasure we fear the\
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1849) consequences\
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1850) of removing ourselves away from allah\
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1853) just like a a mother in in in a shopping\
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1857) center with a child and she tells of the\
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1859) child and the child because\
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1861) doesn't want to lose the pleasure of the\
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1862) mother doesn't lose lose that connection\
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1864) wants to come closer to the mother\
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1866) actually holds on to them on the says\
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1867) sorry man please forgive me\
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1869) it's that type of positive fear also\
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1872) obeying god\
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1873) includes submitting to allah subhanahu\
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1876) wa ta'ala\
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1877) this kind of peaceful submission to\
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1879) allah\
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1881) another aspect of worship is that we\
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1883) must direct\
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1884) and single out all acts of worship to\
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1886) allah alone\
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1887) the internal acts of worship which are\
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1889) the actions of the heart because in the\
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1890) islamic tradition\
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1892) you have an understanding of the actions\
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1893) of the heart like\
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1896) like a reliance that you rely on allah\
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1899) and also you have actions of the limbs\
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1902) the external actions such as\
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1905) dua sadaka giving charity\
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1908) prayer you know the bowing and the\
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1910) prostration and so on and so forth\
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1912) now obviously the external acts of\
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1913) worship also have an internal element\
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1915) because you must have ichlas which means\
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1917) you're doing it for the sake of allah\
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1918) you must be sincere\
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1920) you must have the correct intention but\
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1922) it's\
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1923) in it's it's useful just to categorize\
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1925) them as internal and external\
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1926) but they both have a connection from\
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1928) that perspective so this is summarized\
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1931) what is worship it is to know allah to\
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1933) love allah to obey allah and that\
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1935) includes being humble before him having\
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1937) positive fear of allah\
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1939) submitting to allah and also it means to\
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1941) single out and direct\
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1943) internal and external acts of worship to\
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1946) allah alone and this is summarized in um\
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1948) kitab\
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1949) right what's um kitab it's you know uh\
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1952) the um\
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1953) is the mother so it's the mother of the\
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1955) book and what's interesting\
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1956) you know the children revolve around the\
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1958) mother right so the um\
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1960) the mother of the book is quite central\
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1963) to the book and he explains the whole\
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1965) book and um\
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1967) the first chapter of the quran and allah\
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1969) says in the fifth verse\
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1971) it is you we worship and you we ask for\
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1973) help\
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1974) obviously these are the words that we\
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1976) say to allah\
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1978) we say this every day in our five daily\
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1980) prayers\
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1981) we say in every every unit of prayer\
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1985) we say it is you we worship and it is\
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1988) you\
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1988) we ask for help and this basically\
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1993) you know opens the door to massive\
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1995) exegesis volumes and volumes on just\
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1998) what this means\
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=1999) and you know this means love and\
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2001) reliance and so on and so forth but as a\
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2003) useful kind of\
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2006) conceptual analysis if you like worship\
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2007) entails to know allah to love allah to\
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2010) obey allah\
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2010) and to direct and single out all acts of\
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2012) worship to allah alone\
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2014) so let's quickly focus on knowing allah\
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2016) because it's very important to know\
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2018) allah\
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2018) which is you know a key aspect of\
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2021) worship but also it's very important\
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2022) because we spoke about\
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2024) the importance of knowing the human\
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2025) being because you're calling the human\
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2027) being to the way of allah\
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2029) and we now need to understand well we\
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2032) need to know who allah is\
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2033) in order to invite the human being to\
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2036) allah\
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2037) now obviously with allah is the greatest\
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2039) example and i'm not making an analogy\
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2041) you can't make analogies with allah says\
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2044) in the quran\
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2046) there is nothing like his example laser\
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2050) can he as mithil his example\
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2053) anything so there is nothing like any\
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2054) any there is no example\
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2056) that you can use to compare with the\
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2058) example of allah\
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2060) which is a very interesting linguistic\
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2063) strategy here because it's not saying\
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2065) there is\
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2065) nothing like allah there is nothing like\
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2068) allah's example which is more of an\
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2070) emphasis if you like that\
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2072) the total transcendence of allah\
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2074) subhanahu wa ta'ala so what i'm saying\
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2075) now is not an analogy it's more of an\
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2077) a4i argument meaning by greater reason\
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2080) so you know if i'm a salesperson and i'm\
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2083) selling a car to a human being\
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2086) not only must i know the human being in\
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2087) terms of what their likes and dislikes\
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2090) are\
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2090) you know a bit of human psychology to be\
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2092) a good salesperson\
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2093) but in order to make an effective sale i\
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2095) have to know the car\
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2097) if i don't know nothing about the car\
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2099) i'm not going to sold the car so if i'm\
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2101) sending trying to sell the the the\
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2103) person\
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2104) a lamborghini and all i know is about\
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2107) peugeots then with all due respect i'm\
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2109) not gonna sell the lamborghini\
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2110) effectively right\
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2112) so from by greater reason\
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2115) not only must we understand what the\
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2117) human being is as per the quran and\
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2119) sunnah and to really\
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2120) you know from an islamic psychological\
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2121) perspective address the human being in\
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2123) that way\
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2124) but we have to know who allah is as well\
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2126) which is very important\
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2127) and this is important because part of an\
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2130) aspect of worship\
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2131) is to know allah as allah says in the\
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2133) quran chapter 47 verse 19\
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2135) so know that there is no deity except\
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2138) allah so when we say knowledge here to\
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2141) know allah subhanahu wa ta'ala we're\
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2143) really also saying to acknowledge allah\
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2145) to be aware of to recognize and to have\
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2148) certainty in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2150) in the islamic tradition allah in terms\
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2153) of affirming his existence and the fact\
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2155) is where they worship this is the most\
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2157) certain thing for\
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2158) us this is absolute certainty\
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2161) so this is what knowing allah entails as\
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2163) well so obviously i'm just going to\
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2165) summarize this but it's important\
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2166) especially when we talk about wildlife\
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2168) worthy of worship\
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2169) but when we talk about knowing allah\
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2171) we're really talking about the tawheed\
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2173) of allah the oneness\
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2174) of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and we\
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2176) could talk about allah's oneness in the\
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2178) following way and\
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2179) have spoken about in other ways but this\
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2181) is a nice way of\
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2183) putting it together so one way of\
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2185) talking about allah with regards to his\
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2188) tawheed affirming his oneness\
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2190) is to talk about first and foremost the\
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2192) oneness of his creative power\
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2193) what does this mean this means that we\
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2195) affirm that allah is transcendent\
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2197) he is the unique only\
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2201) sustainer maintainer fashioner owner\
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2204) master of\
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2205) everything that exists and this is very\
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2207) important\
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2208) and if you give these descriptions to\
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2210) other than allah\
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2211) then this is what is called as shirk\
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2213) which is associationism this is a form\
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2216) of associationism or associate\
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2219) associating partners with allah\
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2220) in the islamic tradition this is the\
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2223) gravest transgression something that\
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2225) we're going to\
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2226) briefly talk about in a few moments then\
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2228) we can affirm\
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2229) the wonders of allah's names and\
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2231) attributes that allah has\
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2233) names and attributes he says allah's\
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2234) names are the most beautiful names\
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2236) all the beautiful names belongs to allah\
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2240) in actual fact this is something that my\
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2241) dad says which is very interesting you\
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2243) know\
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2243) and i think i told him once actually\
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2245) that's what the quran says right you\
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2246) know\
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2247) the beautiful names belong to allah\
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2250) anyway so when we affirm the wonders of\
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2253) allah's names and attributes what are we\
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2255) saying here we're saying that they are\
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2256) transcendent\
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2257) lasik mithlih we affirm them\
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2260) and we also believe in their maximal\
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2264) perfection\
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2265) in islamic tradition and all the schools\
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2267) of creed the main schools of creed they\
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2270) affirm this that allah\
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2272) is maximally perfect what does this mean\
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2275) well allah's names and attributes are to\
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2277) the highest degree possible\
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2279) they have no deficiency and no flow\
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2282) okay so take for example allah's love\
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2286) so allah is he is the loving\
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2289) so allah's love is to the highest degree\
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2291) possible it's transcendent\
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2293) it's the most purest form of love and\
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2296) it's the highest degree possible without\
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2298) any deficiency without any flaw\
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2300) okay now when\
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2303) you now say that allah's names and\
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2306) attributes are like a human beings\
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2308) what you've done now is humanization\
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2312) okay you've humanized allah's names and\
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2314) attributes which is\
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2315) shirk which is a form of associationism\
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2318) if you do the other way around if you\
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2320) say this human being\
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2322) he is like or his attributes are like\
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2324) allah\
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2325) like he is loving like allah then what\
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2328) you've done\
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2328) is you have dare find that human being\
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2331) which is also\
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2333) which is also associationism or\
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2334) associating partners\
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2336) with allah subhanahu wa ta'ala which is\
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2338) the gravest sin the gravest\
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2339) transgression\
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2340) and we're going to speak about why\
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2341) that's the case in a few moments\
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2343) then another way of understanding\
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2345) allah's oneness\
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2346) is the oneness of his divinity what does\
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2349) this mean this means that allah\
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2351) is worthy of our worship he's whether of\
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2353) our unconditional obedience\
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2355) of our utmost love of our prayers or our\
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2358) extensive praise of our ultimate\
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2359) gratitude\
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2360) he's the only deity worthy of worship\
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2363) all acts of worship the internal acts of\
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2364) worship and the external acts of worship\
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2366) must be dedicated and directed to him\
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2368) alone\
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2369) if you take these acts of worship and\
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2371) you give it to something or someone or\
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2373) some things other than allah\
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2375) this is again associationism this is\
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2378) shikh this is associating partners with\
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2381) allah which is the greatest\
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2382) transgression\
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2383) so in summary to know allah means to\
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2386) acknowledge allah to\
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2387) affirm his existence to be aware of him\
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2389) to recognize him to have certainty in\
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2390) him\
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2392) and you can really talk about knowledge\
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2394) of allah from the perspective\
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2396) of tawheed affirming the oneness of\
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2397) allah which\
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2399) can include if you want to categorize it\
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2401) in this way the oneness of his creative\
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2403) power\
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2403) the one of his oneness of his names and\
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2405) attributes and the oneness of his\
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2406) divinity\
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2407) just to summarize the oneness of his\
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2409) creative powers that he's the only\
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2410) unique transcend\
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2411) transcendent soul creator state and\
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2414) maintainer\
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2415) master of everything that exists if you\
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2418) give these descriptions to other in\
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2419) allah then this is a form of\
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2420) associationism which is the gravest\
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2422) transgression the greatest injustice the\
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2424) greatest injustice the greatest\
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2426) greatest immorality and it's the\
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2429) greatest sin\
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2430) then another way of understanding an\
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2433) additional way of understanding allah's\
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2435) oneness affirming his oneness is\
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2436) affirming his names and attributes\
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2438) that we affirm them we affirm their\
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2440) transcendent nature we also firm them\
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2442) their maximal perfection\
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2444) that they are they are maximally perfect\
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2446) to the highest degree possible without\
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2448) any deficiency\
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2449) and without any flaw and to\
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2452) compare allah allah's attributes to\
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2455) human being\
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2456) and to compare human attributes to allah\
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2458) both of these cases are a form of\
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2459) associationism which is a form of\
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2462) also the key understanding of allahi\
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2467) is that is that oneness of his divinity\
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2470) that allah is the only deity worthy of\
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2472) worship\
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2473) our utmost gratitude and our\
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2476) our greatest love and our prayers and\
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2478) our extensive praise\
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2480) and our acts of worship must be directed\
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2482) to allah alone if we don't do that\
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2484) that's associationism\
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2485) and that is the gravest crime in sin\
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2489) so briefly on associationism the\
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2492) greatest sin is\
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2494) the gravest transgression allah says in\
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2496) the quran in the 25th chapter verses 68\
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2499) and 70\
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2500) indeed allah does not forgive\
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2502) association with him\
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2504) but he forgives what is less than that\
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2506) for whom he wills\
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2507) and he and he who associates others with\
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2509) god with allah\
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2510) has certainly committed a tremendous sin\
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2513) but there is a caveat\
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2514) allah does forgive associationism what\
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2516) this verse is talking about\
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2518) is people who die in a state of shirk\
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2521) or die and not doing tawba not repenting\
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2525) from associationism not repenting from\
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2528) shirik\
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2529) not repenting from associating partners\
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2532) with allah\
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2533) but if you do in your life and may\
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2535) allah protect everyone from this\
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2537) if you do associate partners with allah\
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2539) in your life and you repent to allah\
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2540) you find allah off-forgiving and\
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2543) merciful but if you\
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2544) close the door to allah's\
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2548) mercy and guidance which is always open\
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2550) for every human being\
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2551) if you close the door deliberately by\
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2553) continuing a life of associating\
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2555) partners with allah to the degree\
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2557) that that is your eternal intention if\
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2560) you like because allah says the people\
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2562) of hell\
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2563) you know if they'll be brought back to\
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2564) earth they will do the same thing so\
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2566) it's like you have you're internally or\
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2568) you're perpetually intending\
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2569) associating partners with allah and you\
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2572) and you've died in that state\
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2574) then you've made the decision for\
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2575) yourself you've you've pushed away\
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2577) allah's guidance and mercy\
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2579) you've pushed it away and allah is going\
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2580) to give you what you want\
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2582) yeah and that's something very important\
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2583) for us to understand and\
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2585) you know allah doesn't want us to to\
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2589) associate partners with him allah wants\
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2591) people to connect with him to love him\
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2593) to know him\
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2594) to have a relationship with him allah\
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2596) wants this allah says in the quran that\
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2597) he doesn't prefer disbelief for his\
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2599) servants\
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2600) this is the essence of the meaning and\
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2601) the mufasarin those who explain the\
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2603) quran say that allah wants people to go\
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2605) to paradise\
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2606) we push people away we push allah\
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2609) subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2611) in terms of his guidance and mercy away\
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2613) we push it away\
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2614) and we commit injustice to ourselves and\
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2617) we throw ourselves into the punishment\
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2620) that's why allah says don't blame allah\
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2623) allah didn't wrong them they wronged\
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2624) themselves\
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2625) and this is why the question is not how\
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2627) can a loving lord send someone to hell\
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2629) that's the wrong question\
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2630) it's how can you choose hell over a\
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2633) loving lord how can you do that\
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2635) why are you choosing hell right guidance\
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2637) and mercy and divine perfect love is\
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2639) waiting for you\
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2641) now you know for that to be forced on\
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2644) you from the perspective that you have\
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2645) no free will anymore\
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2646) then everything loses its meaning anyway\
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2649) if i put a gun to your head and said\
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2650) give charity your charity has no meaning\
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2652) likewise in order for these things to\
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2654) have their profound value and\
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2656) significance\
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2657) you have to have a choice so what's\
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2659) going to be your choice are you going to\
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2660) choose hell\
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2661) over a loving lord that's the choice\
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2664) that you need to think about carefully\
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2666) allah says in the quran in chapter 23\
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2668) verses 99 and 100\
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2671) and those who invoke not any other deity\
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2673) along with allah\
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2674) except those who repent and believe\
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2677) and do righteous deeds for those allah\
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2680) will change their sins into good deeds\
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2682) and god is of forgiving most merciful\
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2685) not only will allah forgive you but he\
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2687) will make those evil deeds\
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2688) into good deeds this phenomenon and this\
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2691) includes\
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2692) if you repent to allah if you turn back\
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2695) to allah\
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2696) now just to be a little bit more nuanced\
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2698) and obviously when i have time to unpack\
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2700) this right here and that's why i put it\
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2701) in the notes here\
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2702) now when we're talking about\
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2703) associationism and allah will not\
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2705) forgive associationism that you're going\
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2706) to be\
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2707) in in you're going to throw yourself\
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2709) into hell for eternity\
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2710) this applies to major forms of\
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2712) associating partners with allah\
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2714) there are lesser forms that do not lead\
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2716) to disbelief\
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2717) in this context however major forms of\
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2720) associating\
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2721) with allah include you know praying to\
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2723) other than allah\
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2724) and believing other things are worthy of\
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2726) worship other than allah and that is all\
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2728) disbelief which is if you die in that\
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2730) state\
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2731) then you've thrown yourself into eternal\
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2733) hell\
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2734) and obviously there's nuances here and\
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2737) you know there is a discussion amongst\
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2738) the scholarly tradition that even if you\
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2739) do the lesser forms of associating\
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2741) partners with allah\
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2742) the lesser forms of such as\
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2744) ostentation\
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2746) doing a deed for other than god's sake\
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2748) like you know\
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2749) giving a seminar right this is supposed\
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2751) to be dalla which is\
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2753) you know virtuous in islam you're\
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2754) supposed to be doing it for the sake of\
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2755) allah if i'm doing it for my ego for\
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2757) pray play\
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2758) praise or pleasure this is ostentation\
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2761) and this is what you call the lesser\
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2763) form of but there is a discussion that\
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2765) if there's a continuation of that\
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2767) then that could end up being a major\
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2770) form of\
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2771) in some way there there is that\
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2772) spiritual discussion the point i'm\
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2774) trying to say here is\
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2775) that there's more to be said about this\
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2778) matter there are major forms and lesser\
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2779) forms major forms lead to disbelief\
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2781) lesser forms don't necessarily do that\
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2783) at all and i'm not going to unpack that\
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2785) right here but the most important and\
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2787) that's why you need to continue your\
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2788) intellectual spiritual journey\
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2789) but what's important is to understand\
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2791) that associationism\
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2792) worshipping allah is the greatest sin\
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2795) and if you don't repent from it\
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2797) and you die in that state you die in the\
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2799) state of disbelief the major form\
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2801) of then you've thrown yourself into\
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2803) eternal hell perpetual\
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2804) hell but allah says if you repent\
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2808) and you do good deeds allah would change\
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2811) that evil into good deeds and allah will\
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2812) forgive you and you will find allah\
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2815) in the greatest of your expectations so\
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2818) that's why it's very important as well\
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2819) to have husson of\
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2820) a good opinion of allah subhanahu wa\
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2822) ta'ala if you if you believe he's going\
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2824) to forgive you\
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2825) then he will forgive you and that belief\
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2827) is not just\
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2828) lip service but it manifests in your\
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2830) heart on your tongue and how you act\
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2832) so if you translate that into turning\
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2835) back to allah\
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2836) allah will forgive you okay so\
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2839) because we believe allah's love is\
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2840) maximally perfect without any deficiency\
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2843) and without any flow which is totally\
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2845) different from the christian tradition\
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2846) by the way\
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2847) you know just as a side note and i don't\
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2848) want to go too much into this because\
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2850) with\
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2850) sapience institute we've got a book\
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2852) coming out on this that\
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2854) i don't believe that mainstream\
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2855) christianity has sold the world a lie\
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2858) that the biblical god is a loving god\
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2860) with all due respect how can that be the\
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2862) case\
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2863) because maximal love perfect love\
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2865) entails perfect forgiveness\
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2867) but if you start from the beginning of\
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2869) the adamic\
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2870) narrative adam can't be totally forgiven\
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2873) in the christian tradition there must be\
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2875) a black\
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2875) blood sacrifice forgiveness of humanity\
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2878) the so-called inherent sin which we\
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2879) don't believe in\
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2880) that can only be forgiven outside of the\
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2883) relationship between\
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2884) the believer and his creator it has to\
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2887) be\
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2888) an external sacrifice and you have to\
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2891) acknowledge that sacrifice at the same\
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2893) time\
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2894) which no which is not only a form of\
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2896) injustice but it's not a form of maximal\
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2898) perfection\
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2900) but if you if you contrast that to the\
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2902) quranic narrative\
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2904) it is a manifestation of maximal\
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2906) forgiveness\
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2907) and a loving lord is\
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2910) maximally forgiving so what's the\
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2913) summary of the story\
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2914) adam alaihissalam slips it's not full\
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2917) from grace\
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2918) as the christian tradition says it's a\
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2920) slip allah describes it as a slip\
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2922) and then what does allah say then allah\
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2924) says and and then allah\
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2925) turned to them because who moved allah\
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2928) didn't\
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2929) move from that perspective it was the\
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2932) sin\
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2932) the sinner in that this case who moved\
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2935) in his wife\
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2936) they moved and allah turned to them\
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2939) told them words of forgiveness and allah\
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2942) forgave them\
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2943) it's based on their relationship it's\
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2946) based on\
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2947) them the sincerely for asking for\
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2950) forgiveness\
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2951) but what's very interesting allah turned\
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2953) to them and taught them how\
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2956) allah will forgive them\
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2964) beautiful so this is maximum forgiveness\
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2967) because not only\
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2968) is will allah forgive someone who asked\
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2970) for forgiveness\
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2971) allah turned to to us\
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2975) if you like by extension because islam\
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2978) is our father\
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2979) and and taught him the words of\
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2981) forgiveness\
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2982) so contrast the two scenarios the\
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2985) biblical god can't forgive\
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2987) unless there's something outside of the\
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2989) relationship and it's a blood sacrifice\
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2991) right right it's not based on the\
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2994) relation\
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2996) cannot forgive because he's too holy\
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2998) right\
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=2999) but allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3002) he is transcendent nothing affects him\
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3007) he is complete he's perfect he's asmed\
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3009) he is the independent he is the\
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3010) self-subsisting\
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3012) and he is the loving al-wadud he is the\
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3015) forgiving\
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3016) and allah\
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3020) when a servant transgresses and moves\
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3022) away from allah\
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3023) allah has taught us how to come back\
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3027) to come closer to him just to have a\
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3030) sincere heart\
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3031) and to ask for forgiveness right so it's\
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3034) based on the relationship this is\
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3035) maximal forgiveness\
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3037) anyway there's more to unpack by the way\
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3039) is a quick summary but i wanted to\
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3040) mention this because\
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3042) it's a big lie anyway so\
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3045) why is associationism the greatest sin i\
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3047) have to give credit here to\
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3048) our beloved brother ustad abdullah al\
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3050) and\
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3051) i know it's something that he wrote very\
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3053) recently and\
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3055) i don't think he mentioned all of the\
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3057) stuff i've mentioned but\
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3058) it's complete anyway and he\
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3061) motivated me to add this in and it's\
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3064) motivated me for you to tell you to go\
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3066) to his website abdullah\
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3069) al-andalusi.com he's got a piece on why\
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3072) uh associating partners with allah is\
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3074) the gravest sin\
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3075) and you know he's got a beautiful quote\
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3077) from his piece\
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3079) that says no ephemeral crime done by\
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3082) one human to another whose consequence\
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3084) is temporary\
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3085) and effect is limited can ever match the\
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3087) crime done against the eternal source of\
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3089) all creation\
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3090) i thought that was very beautiful and\
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3091) there's more beautiful statements in his\
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3094) piece concerning that so please read\
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3095) that so i'm just going to briefly talk\
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3096) about why\
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3097) associationism why should why associate\
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3100) partners with what is the greatest sin\
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3102) well think about this since we are\
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3103) created by allah subhanahu wa\
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3105) and solely depend on him denying and not\
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3108) worshiping him is\
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3110) a crime against reality which is\
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3112) something that abdullah mentions it's\
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3114) the greatest\
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3114) in gratitude it's the worst evil and the\
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3117) greatest injustice\
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3119) so let's explain this why is it a crime\
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3121) against reality\
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3122) because rejecting allah is a reject\
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3124) rejection of\
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3125) al-haq that's one of his names the truth\
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3127) itself and the basis for all reality\
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3130) everything exists because of allah and\
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3133) not extensively praising the one worthy\
[0:52:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3135) of extensive praise\
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3136) is a rejection of reality so not\
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3138) worshiping allah\
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3140) associating partners with allah\
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3141) associationism is a crime against\
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3143) reality itself\
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3145) also it's the greatest in gratitude why\
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3147) because not worshiping the one who gives\
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3149) us life\
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3150) and who is the one that everything\
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3152) depends upon is the peak of ingratitude\
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3155) you know our own very existence is\
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3157) because of allah\
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3159) and not being ultimately grateful for\
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3160) this priceless gift which is something\
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3162) we're going to explain in a few moments\
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3164) is the greatest in gratitude\
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3167) you know we may you know you could be\
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3169) ungrateful to your parents i'm grateful\
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3171) to your teachers and grateful to someone\
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3172) who's helped you\
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3173) which is very wrong by the way but the\
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3176) greatest\
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3176) form of gratitude is to be ungrateful to\
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3178) allah because allah created them\
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3180) and all of these things happened as a\
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3183) result of allah subhanahu wa tad\
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3186) it's also the worst evil why because\
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3188) allah is the foundation of our objective\
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3190) values and morals\
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3192) allah is the foundation of the uh\
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3195) the fact that human beings have\
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3197) objective value\
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3198) allah is the foundation for our\
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3200) objective morals now we're going to\
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3202) unpack that philosophy right here\
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3204) but rejecting allah is rejecting the\
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3206) foundation for all values and all morals\
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3208) therefore it's the worst immorality to\
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3211) reject allah\
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3212) not to worship allah also it's the\
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3214) greatest injustice because worship is\
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3216) allah's right\
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3217) not that he needs anything and we're\
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3219) going to talk about that later\
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3220) concerning the objections allah is free\
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3222) is independent of his self-subsisting\
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3225) but this is\
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3225) worship is allah's right by virtue of\
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3228) who he is\
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3229) and not worshiping him is the greatest\
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3231) injustice\
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3232) because if you think about it if worship\
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3235) is allah's right\
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3236) and not worshiping him is is is is is\
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3239) removing\
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3240) is being unjust to allah then being\
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3242) unjust to allah\
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3244) is actually the greatest injustice why\
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3246) because allah\
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3248) is the foundation for all of our rights\
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3251) allah gives our rights value\
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3253) objectivity and he is the one who\
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3256) gives our rights because he is the one\
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3259) who created us and he knows us better\
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3260) than we know ourselves\
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3262) he is the foundation for all of our\
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3263) rights so not giving allah's right\
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3265) is tantamount equivalent of not giving\
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3268) anyone anyone's rights and more because\
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3270) remember allah is perfect and eternal\
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3272) so this is a summary of why sherlock is\
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3275) the great\
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3275) is the greatest sin is the greatest\
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3277) transgression it's a crime against\
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3278) reality\
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3279) it's the greatest in gratitude it's the\
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3281) worst evil and this is the greatest\
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3283) injustice\

[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3286) read more\

[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3302) talk about here\
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3303) let's universalize now the understanding\
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3305) of worship that we mentioned remember\
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3307) is to know allah to love allah to obey\
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3310) allah\
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3311) to and to direct and singular all acts\
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3314) of worship to allah alone\
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3315) so let's universalize this this\
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3318) understanding of worship\
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3320) so it's to know something or some things\
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3323) the most\
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3324) right and remember knowledge here\
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3326) includes the focus of your life\
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3328) what you're aware of the most the thing\
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3330) that you're most certain about\
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3331) from an intellectual and spiritual\
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3333) perspective the thing that you're most\
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3334) certain about\
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3336) also we could say it's the thing that\
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3337) you love the most you know\
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3340) the thing that you love to love\
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3342) something the most okay\
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3344) also it's to obey or to refer to\
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3346) something or some\
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3347) things the most and it's direct acts of\
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3350) devotion to\
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3351) something or some things the most and\
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3352) that includes ultimate gratitude and\
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3354) extensive praise\
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3355) so let me just summarize universalizing\
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3357) the understanding of worship in the\
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3358) islamic tradition\
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3360) it's to know something the most which\
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3362) includes focusing the thing that you\
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3363) focus in your life the most\
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3365) the thing that you're aware of the most\
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3366) the thing that you're most certain about\
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3368) it's the thing that you love the most or\
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3370) the things that you love the most\
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3372) it's the things that you obey or refer\
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3374) to the most\
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3375) and it's the thing or things that you\
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3377) direct acts of devotion to something the\
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3380) most such as ultimate gratitude and\
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3381) extensive praise\
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3384) and what's interesting is when we have a\
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3387) discussion\
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3388) obviously with hikima with wisdom and\
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3390) with rahman with mercy with our fellow\
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3391) human being\
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3393) you know we want to get them to\
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3394) understand that actually worshiping\
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3396) something by virtue of\
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3398) what we've just done concerning\
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3400) universalizing the\
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3401) the concept of worship right the thing\
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3404) that you know the most the thing that\
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3405) you love the most the thing that you\
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3406) obey the most the thing that you direct\
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3408) acts of devotion towards the most like\
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3410) ultimate gratitude and extensive praise\
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3412) and there are many examples that we can\
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3414) use obviously\
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3415) within the specific context of the\
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3417) dialogue in order to get them to realize\
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3419) that it could be\
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3420) someone's ego someone could be a\
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3421) narcissist it could be other people it\
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3423) could be an ideology like nationalism\
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3425) it could be materialism right so let me\
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3427) give an example with extreme nationalism\
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3430) just to make you understand how you\
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3431) could universalize this concept of\
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3433) worship\
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3434) first let's focus on the thing that you\
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3437) know the most so\
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3438) for some extreme nationalists\
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3441) nationalism its values ideas its\
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3444) philosophies\
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3445) and so on and so forth is the thing that\
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3447) they give most recognition to\
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3449) it's the thing that they give most\
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3450) attention to and the thing that they\
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3452) focus more and also the associated ideas\
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3456) and values that come from nationalism\
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3458) are their center of attention right yes\
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3461) you know\
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3462) say for example they may have to study\
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3463) at university and they may have to study\
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3464) psychology\
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3465) that may become the center of attention\
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3467) for for a temporary period\
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3469) but generally speaking the main focus\
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3471) recognition\
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3472) attention awareness is\
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3477) the kind of nationalistic ideology\
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3482) so that's what it means when they want\
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3484) to know something the most in the\
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3485) context of nationalism nationalism\
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3487) becomes the thing that they want to know\
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3488) the most because it's the thing that\
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3489) they recognize the most\
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3491) they give the most attention to they\
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3492) give the most focus\
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3494) to uh their actions are connected to\
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3496) this ideology the most\
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3498) and you know they give the associate\
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3500) ideas and values\
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3502) more over focus and attention and also\
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3505) they have certainty in this ideologies\
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3507) you know one of the the key things\
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3509) you know if they were to write down what\
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3511) they're most certain about\
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3512) this would be you know extreme\
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3514) nationalist you know they will put their\
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3516) extreme nationalism\
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3517) as as you know the top that in in the\
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3520) top list\
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3522) so they want to know the kind of\
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3525) nationalistic ideology the most what\
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3527) about love\
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3528) well they they love the nation and its\
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3531) history\
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3532) and the ethnic group the most to the\
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3534) degree that it destroys\
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3536) natural relationships and distorts one's\
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3538) moral vision\
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3539) so they love the kind of extreme\
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3541) ideology the nationalism\
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3543) the nation by the way there's nothing\
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3545) wrong with you know loving your country\
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3547) and loving your culture obviously\
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3549) there's a criteria in the islamic\
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3550) spiritual tradition as long as it\
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3551) doesn't basically\
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3553) you know go above islamic values and\
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3555) ethics but\
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3556) that's not extreme nationalism obviously\
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3559) that's totally different that's just you\
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3560) know liking your tribe\
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3561) nothing wrong with that yeah obviously\
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3563) within the same caveats\
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3564) which include islamic ethics and you\
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3567) know the understanding of the quran and\
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3569) the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam\
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3570) in the\
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3571) but let's put that to aside for a moment\
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3573) so from the point of view of worshipping\
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3576) you know nationalism as an ideology you\
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3578) know they love the nation the most it's\
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3579) history\
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3580) and the the ethnic group that belongs to\
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3583) the\
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3584) the nation they love it the most to the\
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3586) degree destroys natural relationships\
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3588) like\
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3588) you know you know fellow human\
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3591) relationships\
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3592) your neighbor right even say you know\
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3595) your spouse right say for example\
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3599) you know you got married to someone\
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3601) who's not of your ethnic background\
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3603) and then later on you start developing\
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3606) this extreme nationalistic ideology\
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3608) and then you get rid of your wife and\
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3609) kids because they're not pure enough\
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3611) right\
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3611) so it destroys natural relationships\
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3613) distorts one more\
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3614) moral vision one's a moral vision you\
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3616) start judging people by by virtue of\
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3619) the the the you know the allegiance to\
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3621) your nationalistic ideology\
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3623) and you judge them and you you you\
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3625) perceive them\
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3627) through the lenses of the particular\
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3629) ethnic group\
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3630) not because of the virtue of the god\
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3632) consciousness or the good character\
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3634) but rather because of this particular\
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3636) ethnic group so it distorts your moral\
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3638) vision\
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3639) that's how much you love it right and\
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3641) you have people like that\
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3643) also you have the obedience part so you\

[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3647) of the nationalistic ideology you d your\
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3650) baits leaders\
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3651) you refer to its symbols to its rules\
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3653) and obligations related to nationalism\
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3656) right also\
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3659) you also direct acts of worship to\
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3663) nationalism how do you do that how do i\
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3665) how do you direct acts of worship to\

[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3679) history or the destroyed view\
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3681) of uh the nation's history you\

[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3687) affairs\
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3688) notwithstanding that no one's perfect\
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3690) and no nation's perfect you do it to the\
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3691) degree that skews your mind\
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3694) and you extensively praise its\
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3697) nationalistic symbols\
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3698) and leaders more than anything and you\
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3700) give the ultimate gratitude you're like\
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3702) oh you know i wouldn't be me if it\
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3704) wasn't for\
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3705) my nation you know life would be\
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3707) meaningless without this\
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3709) you know without my nation and you know\
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3711) the adherence to this extreme\
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3713) nationalism and so on and so forth so\
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3715) this kind of extensive praise\
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3716) if it's the thing that you praise the\
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3717) most and the thing that you direct your\
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3719) utmost gratitude towards the most\
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3721) well that's acts of worship so you can\
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3723) see now that extreme nationalism\
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3725) could be your idol\
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3728) you could be an atheist nationalist\
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3732) still your idol by virtue of what we've\
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3735) done with regards to universalizing the\
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3736) concept of worship\
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3738) or making it applicable here because\
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3740) remember it's to know something the most\
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3741) to love something the most to obey\
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3742) something the most into direct acts of\
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3744) worship towards something the most and\
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3745) we've just discussed that with an\
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3746) example\
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3747) extreme nationalism and allah makes this\
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3749) clear that\
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3750) you know association associationism or\
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3753) worshiping something\
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3754) or worshiping something other than allah\
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3755) it's not just about you know worshipping\
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3757) a physical idol\
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3758) you know allah says in the quran in\
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3760) chapter 2 verse 165\
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3761) and yet among the people of those who\
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3764) take other than allah\
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3765) as equals to him they love them as they\
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3768) should love allah\
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3769) but those who believe are stronger in\
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3771) the love of allah\
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3772) so again here you know if you know\
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3776) they they love things other than allah\
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3778) but allah should be loved\
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3779) the most also allah says in the quran in\
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3782) chapter 45 verse 23 have you not seen no\
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3784) one who takes his desire\
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3786) as his own lord he takes his god as his\
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3788) own desire\
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3789) right you know the narcissistic people\
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3792) in the world you know this like self\
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3793) worship well\
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3794) self self-worship their auto deity you\
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3797) know self-worth\
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3798) self-worship you know the egos to the\
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3800) degree where\
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3801) they basically just worship the dictates\
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3804) of\
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3804) the blameworthy desires and the ego\
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3807) centric and egotistical\
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3809) desires right that becomes an object of\
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3812) their worship\
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3813) also allah says in the quran chapter 9\
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3815) verse 31 they have taken their rabbis\
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3818) and monks as well as the messiah son of\
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3820) mary as lords besides allah even though\
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3822) they were commanding to worship\
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3824) none but allah there is no deity worthy\
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3827) of worship except him\
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3828) glorified is he above what they\
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3830) associate with him\
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3832) obviously we're not unpacking these\
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3833) verses any depth but it's just to give\
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3835) you an indication it's not just about\
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3836) physical idol\
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3837) it's also about another human being it's\
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3839) also about your own self your own ego\
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3841) it also includes things like love and so\
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3844) on and so forth\
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3846) so in the context of dawah in the\
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3848) context of sharing islam with people\
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3850) you could ask certain questions with\
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3852) regards to the topic that we're dealing\
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3854) with today\
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3855) so you could ask for example and say you\
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3856) know was there something at any moment\
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3858) in your life that you wanted to\
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3860) know the most meaning that your whole\
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3862) life was was was based about about\
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3864) recognizing this idea them also this\
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3866) thing the most\
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3867) or your whole focus of life was centered\
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3870) around this thing the most\
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3871) right or what were you most certain\
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3873) about you know was there something\
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3875) in any moment in your life that you\
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3876) loved the most to the degree where\
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3879) you know it you loved it more than you\
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3881) know natural love like the mother\
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3884) the love of your mother or or love of\
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3886) your siblings and so on and so forth\
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3888) you know was it something that you\
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3889) obeyed or referred to the most it could\
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3891) be not one thing could be many things by\
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3892) the way you know all the things that\
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3893) we've spoken so far it could be not just\
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3895) one thing but many things you know\
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3896) maybe obedience is something you may not\
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3898) recognize but you know something that\
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3900) you refer to the most it's\
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3901) it's your frame of reference it's your\
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3903) it's your basis\
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3905) it may be your explicit implicit kind of\
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3908) frame of reference the thing that you\
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3909) always refer to the most for some it\
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3911) could be you know\
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3912) you know a celebrity or a leader or it\
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3915) could be the dictates of materialism\
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3917) whatever and obviously you don't have to\
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3919) ask these questions in this way but i'm\
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3921) asking them in this simple way so it\
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3922) just opens your mind on how\
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3923) you can interact with your fellow human\
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3925) being and you could\
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3927) raise the question concerning you know\
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3931) you if have you ever expressed you know\
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3933) ultimate gratitude towards something or\
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3935) some\
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3936) things the most or praise some things uh\
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3938) the most or gave extensive praise to\
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3940) something the most\
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3942) so when you ask these type of questions\
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3944) of related questions\
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3946) you get to get you get them to think and\
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3948) then you say to them or from an islamic\
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3950) spiritual tradition\
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3951) that thing or those things are actually\
[1:05:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3953) your objects of worship\
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3957) and and this is very interesting because\
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3959) it also echoes what the thinker martin\
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3961) ling said\
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3962) he's something very profound he said man\
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3965) cannot not worship because that's the\
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3966) default position of human beings because\
[1:06:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3968) if this\
[1:06:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3968) something that you've loved the most at\
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3970) one point or obeyed the most or\
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3971) wanted to know the most or you've you've\
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3975) directed acts of worship like ultimate\
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3977) gratitude and extensive praise towards\
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3978) the most\
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3979) then that is your object of worship and\
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3982) human beings\
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3983) always do that right and that's why it's\
[1:06:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3986) very interesting that martin ling said\
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3988) man cannot not worship and he says\
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3990) equipped as he is by his very nature for\
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3992) worship\
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3992) man cannot not worship and if his\
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3994) outlook is cut from the spiritual plane\
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3997) he will find a god to worship at some\
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=3999) lower level\
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4000) that's endowing something relative with\
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4002) what belongs only to the absolute\
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4005) which is very interesting he makes\
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4006) another interesting point which is not\
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4008) entirely related but he says\
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4009) the desire for freedom is above all the\
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4011) desire for god\
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4013) absolute freedom being a central aspect\
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4015) of divinity which is very interesting\
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4017) now you know the euro 2020 just happened\
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4021) obviously it's 2021 but because the\
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4023) pandemic\
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4024) euro 2020 just finished and who won\
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4028) i forgot who won oh the italians one of\
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4030) course yeah\
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4031) i watched the game i was quite upset\
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4033) that england lost anyway so\
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4035) um the italians won so if you look at a\
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4037) lot of football fans especially the kind\
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4039) of\
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4039) you know extreme\
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4042) football fans right football becomes the\
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4045) the idol worship\
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4047) right or the football team is the object\
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4049) of worship\
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4051) because if you think about all of these\

[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4114) even if it's subconscious explicit or\
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4116) implicit\

[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4136) worship but you know i haven't analyzed\
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4139) it too much but you get the point even\
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4140) when it comes to football\

[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4144) team and favorite football players can\
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4146) be the the objects of worship even from\
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4148) the perspective of what we've just\
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4149) discussed in terms of what worship\
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4150) entails\
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4153) now this is one of my favorite verses in\
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4156) the quran because it elucidates and\
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4158) elaborates on this idea that everyone is\
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4160) in a state of worship allah says in\
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4161) chapter 39 verse 29\
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4163) allah puts forward this illustration can\
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4165) a man who has several partners for his\
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4167) masters of which\
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4168) our odds with each other be considered\
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4170) equal to a man devoted holy to one\
[1:09:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4172) master\
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4173) all praise belongs to allah though most\
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4176) of them do not know\
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4178) think about this amazing amazing analogy\
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4180) allah is giving you this illustration\
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4182) allah is giving\
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4183) he is basically saying to us from a\
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4184) double pondering point of view he is\
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4186) telling us\
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4187) that there are two states of the human\
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4189) being either you are worshiping\
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4192) something other than allah or some\
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4194) things other than allah\
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4195) and they don't know what's really best\
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4197) for you and they don't love you and have\
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4199) merciful and have affection for you\
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4200) like allah does because the prophet said\
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4202) that allah has more affection for his\
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4204) servants than the mother has to her\
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4206) young ones right\
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4207) and allah knows you because he created\
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4209) you these things that you worship don't\
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4210) you know don't know you\
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4211) they don't want best for you right and\
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4213) they're all quarreling so that's one\
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4214) state\
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4215) the other state is that you're actually\
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4217) connected to and worshipping the one\
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4218) that is worthy of worship\
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4220) and isn't this this describe life if\
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4223) you're not connected to and be us\
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4225) being at service to and worshiping allah\
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4227) you're going to be worshipping something\
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4229) else\
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4229) your football team your ideology your\
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4231) nufs your ego\
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4232) your shahad your blameworthy desires\
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4235) i don't know it's so many things that\
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4237) you could that that replace allah\
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4239) subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4241) if you're not knowing allah loving allah\
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4243) obeying allah and directing acts of\
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4244) worship to allah alone\
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4246) you're going to be knowing something\
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4247) else loving something else obeying\
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4249) something else and directing acts of\
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4250) worship to something else\
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4252) so what situation would you rather be\
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4254) the person who is enslaved to all of\
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4256) these masters and they're all quarreling\
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4258) or the one who is enslaved to one master\
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4260) whose condition is best\
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4262) and this will give you true freedom and\
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4263) that's why you know i want you to call\
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4265) this seminar the free slave\
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4267) because what's interesting when you\
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4268) enslave yourself to allah you are truly\
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4270) liberated you free yourself from the\
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4272) other shackles of the enslavement to\
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4273) yourself\
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4274) and to other people or to other things\
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4278) and this freedom is amazing because you\
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4281) know the word for soul in arabic is raw\
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4284) and it shares the same root as the word\
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4287) which means ease and liberty right in\
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4290) turkish\
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4291) they have the word i believe which is\
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4293) you know from the arabic it's like ease\
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4295) and liberty\
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4296) and what's interesting is that the soul\
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4299) can\
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4300) only achieve this ease and liberty and\
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4302) serenity\
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4303) if it is that service to allah connects\
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4306) to allah\
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4307) if it doesn't worship allah then it\
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4309) won't have raha it won't have\
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4310) that spiritual liberation so if you\
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4312) truly want to be liberated\
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4314) then don't worship the one the things\
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4316) that are not worthy of worship\
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4317) worship allah subhanahu wa tala so\
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4321) in your discussion with your fellow\
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4322) human being and you raise these\
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4324) questions and you get them to understand\
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4326) that okay if this is true then i'm\
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4327) worshiping something and\
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4329) you get them to realize that the thing\
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4330) that they're worshiping is not actually\
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4331) worthy of worship\
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4333) and that would create an existential\
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4334) spiritual vacuum for you now to talk\
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4336) about\
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4336) but let me introduce to you why allah is\

[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4350) who he is\
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4351) allah says in the quran in chapter 20\
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4352) verse 14 indeed i am god i am allah\
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4355) there is no\
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4356) deity except me so worship me and\
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4358) establish prayer for my remembrance\

[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4414) iqbal when he said\
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4415) this prostration that you find so\
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4417) difficult frees you from a thousand\
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4419) frustrations\
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4420) or you could talk about rumi right you\

[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4424) and you know he came up with some\
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4426) amazing lines\
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4427) phenomenal lines actually in in in many\
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4430) of his lines are\
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4430) quite deep you know when he says things\
[1:13:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4433) like the\
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4434) the cure to pain is in the pain itself\
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4436) all right\
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4437) also when he says and i'm paraphrasing\
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4439) you know true lovers\
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4440) don't really fall in love they are they\
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4442) were already in love before they met\
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4444) right which is another beautiful thing\
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4447) and\
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4448) so on and so forth so you might love his\
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4450) poetic attributes so\
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4451) you praise him by virtue of his\
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4453) eloquence or his act\
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4454) his poetic attributes and linguistic\
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4456) attributes right even though he's not\
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4458) perfect he's deficient and flawed he's a\
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4460) human being he's contingent\
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4461) but you still give him praise by virtue\
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4463) of his attributes\
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4465) likewise if you're not interested in\
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4466) poetry maybe you like football\
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4468) as we say in the uk or soccer as you say\
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4470) in north america\
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4471) in america you might like soccer you\
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4474) know uefa the euro\
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4476) 2020 has happened and\
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4479) you may you may have been you know\
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4481) extremely\
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4482) um impressed by i don't know one of the\
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4485) italian players\
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4487) and you know you praised him you gave\
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4488) him a round of applause you you stood up\
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4490) you're like wow brilliant right bravo\
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4493) whatever they say in italy\
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4494) and so you praised him by virtue of his\
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4498) because of his football attributes his\
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4500) soccer attributes his athletic\
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4501) attributes and so on and so forth\
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4503) but he's not perfect he's a human being\
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4505) he's probably rated eight out of ten\
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4507) he's not 10 out of 10 and even if it's\
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4509) 10 out of 10 it's within the human\
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4510) context is contingent and limited flow\
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4512) and flowed in some way\
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4514) so these examples i'm giving you to get\
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4515) you to understand that we naturally give\
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4517) praise to things by virtue of their\
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4519) attributes\
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4521) even though their attributes don't\
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4522) directly benefit us in any way they\
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4524) don't sustain us\
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4525) or you know keep us alive and even\
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4528) though their attributes are not perfect\
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4529) they have some deficiency and flaw\
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4532) so if it's true that we can praise\
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4534) things that don't directly benefit us in\
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4536) any way\
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4537) and praise them by virtue of their\
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4538) limited and flawed attributes\
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4541) then what does it mean about praising\
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4544) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4546) whose names and attributes are to the\
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4548) highest degree possible\
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4549) without any deficiency and without any\
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4552) flow\
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4554) what does it mean it means allah is\
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4557) worthy of extensive praise\
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4559) and extensive praise is a form of\
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4561) worship we already mentioned\
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4563) um kitab surah al-fatiha the summary of\
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4565) the whole of the quran the first chapter\
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4567) of the quran\
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4568) what does allah say in the first line\
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4570) alhamdulillah\
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4572) all perfect praise and gratitude belong\
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4574) to the lord of everything that exists\
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4577) praise and gratitude our keys to worship\
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4579) are forms of worship\
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4582) so allah is worthy of worship by virtue\
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4584) of who he is and not necessarily because\
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4586) he's\
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4586) manifested his names and attributes in\
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4588) your life in any positive way\
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4591) don't get me wrong he is worthy of\
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4593) worship and worthy of praise and\
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4594) gratitude because\
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4595) what he gives us and provides us but\
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4597) even if he didn't\
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4598) allah is worthy of worship by virtue of\
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4601) who he is\
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4602) even if there was nothing to worship him\
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4606) allah is still worthy of worship\
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4608) and allah is so majestic and his\
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4611) attributes are so perfect\
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4613) that if the whole world were to worship\
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4616) him it wouldn't increase in his majesty\
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4619) and if the whole world were to not\
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4621) worship him he wouldn't decrease in his\
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4622) majesty\
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4624) so the first point allah is worthy of\
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4626) worship by virtue of who he is\
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4628) it's essentially is allah's right to\
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4631) worship it's a necessary fact of his\
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4632) existence because of who he\
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4634) is just like what we just discussed\
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4636) second point\
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4638) the second reason why our lives worthy\
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4639) of worship allah created and sustains\
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4642) everything allah says in the quran in\
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4644) chapter 35 verse 3\
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4646) o mankind remember the favor of allah\
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4648) upon you is there any other creator\
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4650) other than allah\
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4651) who provides from for you from the\
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4653) heavenly earth there is no deity except\
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4655) him\
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4655) so how are you deluded again think about\
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4658) this allah is\
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4660) he is the creator he he is the\
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4663) perpetually creating\
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4665) and allah subhanahu wa\
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4668) he basically created us in our lives and\
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4670) i need to think about this whole\
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4671) experiment\
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4672) there is something in our life that has\
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4675) been given to us\
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4676) freely that is priceless that we don't\
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4678) earn own or deserve\
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4681) and if it's true there is something in\
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4683) our lives that is given to us freely at\
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4684) every moment of our existence that we\
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4686) don't earn own\
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4687) or deserve and it's priceless then how\
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4690) should we feel we should be grateful\
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4693) what is this thing\
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4694) it's every moment conscious moment of\
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4697) our existence\
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4698) these conscious moments come from allah\
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4700) we don't earn own or deserve them we\
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4702) can't even create a fly we can't create\
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4703) life\
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4704) and we know it's a priceless gift\
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4706) because if i told you you have 10\
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4708) minutes of conscious moments left and in\
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4709) order to have another 10 days you have\
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4711) to give me all of your wealth you give\
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4712) me all of your wealth\
[1:18:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4714) such is the priceless gift of these\
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4715) conscious moments\
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4717) and they're priceless and they're given\
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4719) to us for free\
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4720) and we don't earn own or deserve them\
[1:18:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4721) how should it make us feel grateful but\
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4723) grateful to whom\
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4724) grateful to the one who gave you these\
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4726) conscious moments allah subhanahu wa\
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4728) ta'ala\
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4728) and gratitude as we explained is a key\
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4730) and a form of worship\
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4733) the third point allah provides us with\
[1:18:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4735) innumerable innumerable favors\
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4737) allah says in the quran in chapter 14\
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4739) verse 34\
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4741) and if you should try to count to\
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4743) enumerate the favors of allah\
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4746) you could not enumerate them indeed\
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4748) mankind is generally most\
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4750) unjust and ungrateful now i wanted to\
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4752) find a thought experiment or an example\
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4754) to show\
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4755) that we could find one blessing and that\
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4757) we couldn't count that blessing\
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4760) and and i wanted to apply it to someone\
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4762) who suffers or someone who has a great\
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4764) life\
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4765) right i didn't i didn't want to just\
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4766) just to be applied to someone\
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4768) who has a great life but someone who has\
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4770) a life that may not be\
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4772) full of well-being and there is a good\
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4775) example\
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4776) by the way this example has come from\
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4778) also our\
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4779) early pious scholars and it's the\
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4781) heartbeat\
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4783) think about the heartbeat as a blessing\
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4784) brothers and sisters the heartbeat is\
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4787) the physical\
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4787) suburb physical cause that allah uses to\
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4790) keep us alive and we already spoke about\
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4792) the priceless gift of life of every\
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4794) conscious moment\
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4796) the heartbeat if we had 10 heartbeats\
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4798) left\
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4800) and if i set you to get another 10 000\
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4802) heartbeats you have to give me all of\
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4804) your wealth you will give me all of your\
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4805) wealth\
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4805) such as the priceless reality of every\
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4808) heartbeat\
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4811) and we don't remember what we said\
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4813) previously we don't earn\
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4815) these conscious moments or own them or\
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4817) deserve them and it's given to us freely\
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4819) in these conscious moments as a result\
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4820) of a heartbeat\
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4823) so here's the question i want you to\
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4826) individually count all the heartbeats\
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4828) you've had in a lifetime\
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4829) i want you to individually count all the\
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4832) heartbeats you've had in a lifetime it's\
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4833) impossible\
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4834) for the first two or three years you\
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4835) can't even count\
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4838) when you're sleeping you can't count you\
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4839) have a huge black backlog\
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4841) it's practically logically impossible to\
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4843) count enumerate individual heartbeat in\
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4845) a lifetime now let's shift this with\
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4847) regards to gratitude\
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4848) i want you to think about alhamdulillah\
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4850) for every single hobby you had in a\
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4852) lifetime it's impossible\
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4853) you got such a backlog even if you\
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4855) started from the day that you don't have\
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4857) to count and how to speak\
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4858) you couldn't do it because you when you\
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4859) sleep you can't do it\
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4861) so isn't it true that we can't enumerate\
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4864) individually each of our heartbeats and\
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4865) even be thankful for each one of our\
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4867) heartbeats\
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4869) one blessing and if we have this correct\
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4872) perspective we understand that\
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4874) anything above a heartbeat is a bonus in\
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4877) actual fact even if you had the ability\
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4878) to be grateful for every single\
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4880) heartbeat you've had individually\
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4882) you would have to be grateful for the\
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4884) ability to be grateful\
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4886) there'll be an infinite regress of\
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4887) gratitude the point here is\
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4890) we can never truly be thankful\
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4893) and count the favors of allah\
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4896) and interesting is in this verse i think\
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4898) allah doesn't use the favor\
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4899) in terms of blessing in terms of the\
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4901) plurals and the singular\
[1:21:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4903) as a linguistic ploy to show forget\
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4906) all the blessings one blessing you\
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4908) couldn't count not even the heartbeat\
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4911) so if we can't even truly be grateful\
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4912) for a heartbeat imagine\
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4914) what type of gratitude we must have for\
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4916) everything else brothers and sisters\
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4920) and all of those things that as a result\
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4921) of allah subhanahu wa\
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4924) our utmost gratitude is due to allah\
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4930) the fourth point while allah is worthy\
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4931) of worship is concerning self-love\
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4934) now self-love leads to the love of allah\
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4937) now what do i mean by self-love don't\
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4939) accuse me of promoting narcissism here\
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4940) yeah i'm not talking about narcissistic\
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4942) traits culvert narcissism or you know\
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4946) you know the the the normal narcissist\
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4950) none of this narcissism i'm not talking\
[1:22:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4951) about this\
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4952) i'm talking about a mature self-love\
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4954) it's the kind of self-love that\
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4956) the eric from the psychologist he writes\
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4958) in his book the art of loving\
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4960) it's like wanting good for yourself so\
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4962) it's a mature and it's intellectual type\
[1:22:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4964) of self-love\
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4965) and also you know if you think about it\
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4967) there's nothing closer to you than you\
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4969) if you don't love yourself happy not\
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4971) love anyone else right\
[1:22:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4973) and you know if you want to be loving\
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4975) and to be is to be related\
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4977) if you can't relate to yourself in a\
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4978) loving way then how are you going to\
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4979) love anyone else\
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4980) and that's why a lot of these people who\
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4982) really hate who are not nice people\
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4985) they don't really want good for\
[1:23:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4986) themselves they don't really love\
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4987) themselves\
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4988) and this echo what the polymath the\
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4990) proof of islam ali ghazali the 11th\
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4992) century theologian\
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4993) may allah have mercy on him he talks\
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4995) about this in his ihea in his revival to\
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4997) the\
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4998) village of sciences i think he's in the\
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=4999) 36 volume he talks about love he talks\
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5001) about this type of love this self love\
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5003) that you want good for yourself you\
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5004) don't want bad for yourself\
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5006) and ala ghazali is saying if you truly\
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5008) love yourself\
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5009) from the perspective that you want good\
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5010) for yourself you have to love allah and\
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5012) why\
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5012) because who created you who created the\
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5014) aspar the physical causes that you can\
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5016) use\
[1:23:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5017) to actually come towards good\
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5020) to get pleasure to run away from pain\
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5022) right to achieve your goals\
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5025) who is the source of love so all of it\
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5028) so these are the kind of\
[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5029) basic concepts that he's trying to\
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5030) allude to and if you\
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5032) love yourself and you don't love allah\
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5034) then you're basically in a state of\
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5036) delusion\
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5036) and he says whoever is so besotted by\
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5039) his fleshy appetites as to lack this\
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5042) love\
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5042) neglects his lord and creator he\
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5045) possesses no authentic knowledge of him\
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5047) his gaze is limited to the cravings and\
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5050) to things of sense\
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5052) so self-love should leave lead to the\
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5055) love of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5056) by virtue of asking certain questions\
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5059) who is the source of love\
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5061) who created me who created the physical\
[1:24:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5064) causes in order for me to use to\
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5066) actually\
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5066) achieve pleasure achieve goodness for\
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5069) myself\
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5070) and run away from pain who actually\
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5073) knows what's really good for me allah is\
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5076) the source of all goodness\
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5077) and so on and so forth so if you love\
[1:24:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5080) yourself and you don't really love allah\
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5082) then you don't really\
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5083) you you just you just besotted by your\
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5085) fleshy appetites as al-ghazali says\
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5087) and you don't have authentic knowledge\
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5089) of allah and that's why knowledge and\
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5091) love are very important in islamic\
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5092) tradition\
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5093) because in order to love something\
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5095) properly you have to know it right\
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5097) so to know that allah is a source of\
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5098) love to know that allah creates\
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5100) everything and causes everything to\
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5102) happen and so on and so forth\
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5104) these things are very important because\
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5105) once you want good for goodness for\
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5107) yourself and you know allah then you're\
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5108) gonna love allah immediately\
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5109) because he's the source for all of that\
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5112) goodness\
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5114) and remember loving allah is a form of\
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5116) worship\
[1:25:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5117) the fifth point allah is worthy of\
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5119) worship\
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5121) because he is the most loving so we're\
[1:25:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5123) focusing on\
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5124) on one of his names here the fact that\
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5127) he is\
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5127) the loving now allah says in the quran\
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5131) in chapter 85 verse 14 he is the\
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5132) forgiving\
[1:25:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5133) the loving allah says in the quran in\
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5135) surah baqarah second chapter verse 165\
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5138) we already mentioned this\
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5139) and yet among the people are those who\
[1:25:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5141) take other than\
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5142) god as equals to him they love them as\
[1:25:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5144) they should love\
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5145) allah but those who believe are strongly\
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5147) in the love of allah\
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5148) also the prophet said which connects to\
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5150) this in some way allah is more\
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5152) affectionate\
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5152) seventh than a mother to her children\
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5154) narrated by abu dhawud\
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5156) now this is very important when we spoke\
[1:25:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5159) about allah's names and attributes and\
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5160) that's why we had to mention\
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5162) allah's names and attributes annoying\
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5164) allah we said allah's names and\
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5166) attributes are perfect without any\
[1:26:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5167) deficiency and flaw and that they are to\
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5169) the highest degree possible\
[1:26:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5171) so just by virtue of understanding this\
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5172) in the context of allah's love because\
[1:26:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5174) he says he is\
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5176) and understanding who allah is and and\
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5178) having good and having correct knowledge\
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5180) of him as al-ghazali says\
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5182) you're going to be compelled to love\
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5183) allah why allah is\
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5185) coming from the arabic word wood which\
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5186) means a loving that is giving his love\
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5188) is to the highest degree possible\
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5189) without any deficiency and without any\
[1:26:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5191) flow\
[1:26:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5191) without any deficiency and without any\
[1:26:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5194) flaw\
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5195) his love is to the highest degree\
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5196) possible and it's the most purest form\
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5198) of love why because when allah loves he\
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5200) doesn't need to love yet he loves allah\
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5202) it doesn't require completion he is\
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5204) ahmed he is\
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5206) he is the independent he was the self\
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5208) subsisting he is elegant\
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5209) he is the free he's the rich he's the\
[1:26:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5211) independent\
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5213) and his love is greater than any love we\
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5215) can imagine even a mother's love because\
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5216) when a mother loves she\
[1:26:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5217) needs to love it completes her allah\
[1:27:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5220) doesn't require completion yet he loves\
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5222) imagine how pure his love is so allah's\
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5224) love is to the highest degree possible\
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5226) allah's love is the most purest form of\
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5227) love\
[1:27:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5228) so we must be compelled to love him\
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5230) here's a thought experiment\
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5232) if someone came into your room and i\
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5233) said this person is the most loving\
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5234) person to have ever and will have ever\
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5236) walked on this earth\
[1:27:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5237) something is going to happen to you\
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5238) something is going to happen do you want\
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5240) to be able to understand what that love\
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5241) is\
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5242) by greater reason and allah is the\
[1:27:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5245) highest example\
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5246) if allah has the most purest form of\
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5249) love\
[1:27:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5250) and allah's love is the most maximal\
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5252) perfect love with no deficiency or no\
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5254) flaw\
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5255) then we must be true of allah we must be\
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5258) compelled to love allah\
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5260) and loving allah is a form of worship\
[1:27:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5262) the sixth reason why allah is worthy of\
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5264) worship\
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5264) is because we are natural born\
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5266) worshipers allah says that our purpose\
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5268) in life and this is in chapter 51 verse\
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5270) 56\
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5270) i did not create the spirit world the\
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5272) jinn nor mankind\
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5274) except to worship me meaning except to\
[1:27:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5275) worship allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala\
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5277) we are natural born worshippers we\
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5280) already discussed this by universalizing\
[1:28:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5282) the concept of the aspects of worship\
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5284) and we know that we we have something\
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5286) that we focus on the most or we want to\
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5288) know the most we have something that we\
[1:28:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5289) love the most we have something that we\
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5290) obey the most we have something that we\
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5292) direct our\
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5293) extensive praise and gratitude ultimate\
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5295) gratitude towards the most these\
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5297) it could be one thing or many things the\
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5299) point is we do do that\
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5301) so that's our object of worship we're\
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5303) natural born worshipers\
[1:28:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5304) whether worshiping allah worshiping\
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5306) something other than allah and we\
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5308) already spoke about the fitra and the\
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5309) innate disposition\
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5310) that we have this natural tendency to\
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5314) worship and to love something the most\
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5315) to refer to something the most\
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5317) and to give extensive praise to\
[1:28:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5319) something the most it might be your own\
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5320) ego or other people or an ideology but\
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5322) the point is we do that\
[1:28:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5324) it seems to be that we have a natural\
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5326) from a phenomenological perspective\
[1:28:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5329) from the perspective of the first person\
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5331) experience that we we\
[1:28:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5333) we worship something by virtue of what\
[1:28:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5336) we've discussed concerning the aspects\
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5338) of what the aspects of worship\
[1:28:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5339) are\
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5343) so if we're natural-born worshippers\
[1:29:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5346) then we need to realize that we need to\
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5350) worship the one that is actually worthy\
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5351) of worship\
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5352) and just by merely talking about allah\
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5356) who he is\
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5358) describing allah as allah described\
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5360) himself and as as the prophet\
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5361) described allah allah is beauty and he\
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5365) loves beauty\
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5366) allah's names are the most beautiful\
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5368) names allah is the soul creator the\
[1:29:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5370) sustainer he is\
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5372) he is the loving he is the intensity\
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5374) merciful he is\
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5376) al-barr the source\
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5386) and so on and so forth when you when you\
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5388) just introduce people to allah and since\
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5391) they are natural born worshipers they're\
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5392) going to be compelled\
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5394) to worship allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and\
[1:29:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5396) this may not be necessarily a reason why\
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5398) allah is worthy of worship\
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5399) but it gives you the kind of you know\
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5402) background to why allah\
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5404) you know is worthy of worship or or why\
[1:30:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5407) we should worship allah or the kind of\
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5408) driving force behind all of this because\
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5410) we're natural born worshipers we are\
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5412) born to worship\
[1:30:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5413) and some people don't have allah in\
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5415) their life they don't know who allah is\
[1:30:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5417) and that's why they worship other than\
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5418) allah but the minute you introduce who\
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5420) allah\
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5420) is his names and attributes his reality\
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5422) who he is\
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5424) people are going to be compelled if they\
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5425) have you know sincerity they're going to\
[1:30:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5427) be compelled to worship allah\
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5430) finally the seventh reason why allah is\
[1:30:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5432) worthy of worship\
[1:30:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5434) is we must obey allah\
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5437) allah is worthy of our unconditional\
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5439) obedience\
[1:30:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5440) allah says in the quran in chapter 3\
[1:30:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5442) verse 132\
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5443) and obey allah and the prophets that he\
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5445) may so that you may be given mercy\
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5448) and we know obedience to the first islam\
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5450) is as a result of obeying allah because\
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5452) he commands us to do so\
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5454) so why is it the most rational thing to\
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5455) do to obey allah some people say oh you\
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5457) obey god how primitive and medieval this\
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5459) is no i'm sorry we need to be proud\
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5461) about this this is the most it's the\
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5462) high\
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5463) of rationality it's the peak of the\
[1:31:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5465) intellect to worship\
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5467) to obey allah which is a form of worship\
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5469) why well think about this brothers and\
[1:31:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5471) sisters\
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5472) who is allah he's the ultimate authority\
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5476) he is the knowing he is the wise he has\
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5477) the totality of knowledge and wisdom\
[1:31:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5479) allah has the picture\
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5480) we just got a pixelated understanding of\
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5482) reality allah knows and we don't allah\
[1:31:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5485) is\
[1:31:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5485) the source of oh goodness so we're going\
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5487) to follow his commands we're going to\
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5488) obey him because he is the highest\
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5490) authority\
[1:31:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5492) and remember the door swings both ways\
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5494) don't build it to this\
[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5495) don't people atheists non-religious\
[1:31:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5497) people\
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5498) obey things all the time don't you obey\
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5500) the dictates of your ego and your shahad\
[1:31:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5502) your blame where\
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5504) don't you obey the dictates of your\
[1:31:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5505) politicians and the scientists and\
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5507) people of knowledge and doctors i'm not\
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5508) saying you shouldn't obey them in their\
[1:31:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5509) particular particular\
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5511) fields of expertise of course you should\
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5513) of course you should refer to them\
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5514) but don't you do that anyway what does\
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5516) that show it shows that you refer to\
[1:31:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5518) something or obey something\
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5520) by virtue of their\
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5523) expertise when you're on a plane and you\
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5524) know nothing about turbulence or the\
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5526) science of how a plane flies\
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5528) and the pilot says ladies and gentlemen\
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5529) we're going to be experiencing some\
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5531) turbulence please\
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5532) sit down buckle up or you may harm\
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5533) yourself you're not going to say\
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5535) forget this guy i'm going to start you\
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5537) know moon walking on the aisle of course\
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5539) you don't do that you sit down you\
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5540) buckle up you make dua you supplicate to\
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5542) allah right\
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5544) because you know he has an authority\
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5546) that you don't\
[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5547) and you obey him or refer to him by\
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5549) virtue of his authority when we go to a\
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5550) doctor and we say we have these symptoms\
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5552) and we don't have any medical\
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5554) expertise but we know they have the\
[1:32:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5555) background medical expertise and the\
[1:32:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5557) experience\
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5558) and you know the curriculum vitae the\
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5560) the history of\
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5561) of being a good doctor and so on and so\
[1:32:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5563) forth you know\
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5565) the they have the education we we listen\
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5568) to them we say yes\
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5569) okay i have covid for example\
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5572) or have a mala protect us or you know i\
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5576) have\
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5576) you know a certain disease and they tell\
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5578) you to go to a pharmacy and they\
[1:32:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5579) prescribe some drugs for you and you\
[1:33:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5580) take the drugs you don't start now\
[1:33:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5582) questioning the chemical compound of the\
[1:33:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5584) drug or questioning the expertise of the\
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5586) doctor fine you may ask for a second\
[1:33:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5587) opinion but generally speaking\
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5589) you don't reject them you obey them or\
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5591) refer to them by virtue of the\
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5592) particular expertise and authority that\
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5593) they have\
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5594) even when you go to school by the way\
[1:33:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5597) and if you refer to\
[1:33:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5598) the previous seminar that i did on god's\
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5601) testimony i spoke a lot about the\
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5603) epistemology of testimony so i'm just\
[1:33:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5604) summarizing it here now\
[1:33:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5606) when you look into epistemology of\
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5608) testimony\
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5609) you understand that we have to refer to\
[1:33:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5611) the authority of other people we can't\
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5613) know everything just like dr elizabeth\
[1:33:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5614) fricka says that you know given that her\
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5616) limitations are parametric\
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5618) she can't know everything she has to\
[1:33:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5620) refer to the authority of others\
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5621) so if it's true we have to refer to the\
[1:33:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5623) authority of others then by\
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5625) greater reason how must we refer to the\
[1:33:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5628) authority of allah\
[1:33:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5630) since he knows everything he has the\
[1:33:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5632) totality of knowledge and wisdom\
[1:33:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5634) right he has the picture we just got the\
[1:33:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5636) pixel\
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5637) it will be the most rational thing to do\
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5639) to obey allah it is irrational\
[1:34:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5641) to not obey him if it's irrational\
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5644) to reject and disobey and not refer to\
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5648) experts in science or in medicine\
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5651) then imagine how irrational it is to\
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5653) disobey allah subhanallah\
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5655) who created the scientists who created\
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5657) their minds and he who is\
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5658) who has the totality of knowledge and\
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5660) wisdom\
[1:34:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5662) so that's that's why we must obey allah\
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5664) subhanallah now by the way you may argue\
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5666) and remember i said this was a\
[1:34:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5667) phenomenological existential approach\
[1:34:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5669) i'm not saying this is a deductive\
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5671) argument because you may think well\
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5672) doesn't this\
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5673) doesn't this assume allah exists doesn't\
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5675) assume that this is what allah says\
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5677) doesn't this assume that the quran is\
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5679) true\
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5680) don't worry about that because remember\
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5682) what we said about the fitra\
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5683) the cloud could be the cloud could be\
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5686) unclouded\
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5687) by virtue of introducing them to who\
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5689) allah is and why he's worthy of worship\
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5692) and that's very significant from a\
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5693) phenomenological first person experience\
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5695) perspective\
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5697) so to conclude the seminar brothers and\
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5698) sisters there are two main objections to\
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5700) this\
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5701) the first objection is what does allah\
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5703) need our worship\
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5704) of course not we've already affirmed\
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5706) this but just to affirm it again allah\
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5708) says in the quran\
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5709) allah is free of need the praiseworthy\
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5711) he says this in chapter 22 verse 64.\
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5714) and we know allah he is the\
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5716) self-subsisting he is the free he is the\
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5719) rich\
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5720) if the whole universe were to worship\
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5721) him and what's within it it won't\
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5723) increase in his majesty\
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5724) if the whole universe was within it were\
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5726) not to worship him it wouldn't decrease\
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5727) in his majesty\
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5728) allah does not need our worship at all\
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5731) he gains nothing from our worship\
[1:35:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5733) and our lack of it takes nothing away\
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5735) from allah subhanahu wa ta'ala\
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5737) we worship allah because through allah's\
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5738) wisdom and mercy\
[1:35:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5740) he created us that way and allah made\
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5742) worship good and beneficial for us\
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5745) from both a worldly spiritual\
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5746) perspective\
[1:35:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5749) now one would further probe and say well\
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5750) why did he create us for worship\
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5752) fine he created us for worship but why\
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5755) there's two\
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5756) main ways of answering this question the\
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5758) first way is we don't know\
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5760) maybe this refers to the part of god's\
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5762) wisdom that's beyond our limited\
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5764) cognitive abilities\
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5765) and there's nothing wrong with that\
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5766) because you can't compare our\
[1:36:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5768) understanding or\
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5769) our cognitive you know faculties with\
[1:36:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5772) the knowledge and wisdom of allah\
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5773) subhanahu wa tala is it's impossible\
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5775) it's just you know if if a baby\
[1:36:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5778) cannot you know understand quantum\
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5780) physics the quantum physics of a\
[1:36:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5783) professor of theoretical physics or\
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5785) quantum physics\
[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5787) by greater reason how we are ever going\
[1:36:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5789) to even fathom the full wisdom and\
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5791) knowledge of allah this is ridiculous\
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5793) right so one way just is just citing the\
[1:36:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5797) wisdom because not being able to answer\
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5798) this question doesn't undermine the fact\
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5800) that allah is actually worthy of worship\
[1:36:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5803) but there's another way of looking at\
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5804) israel it's focusing in on allah's names\
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5806) and attributes now allah is\
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5808) he is the source of oh goodness and that\
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5811) means he loves good\
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5812) and allah is a maximally good being so\
[1:36:55](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5815) when we say allah is a source of\
[1:36:57](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5817) goodness we're saying he's a source of\
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5819) of all goodness from the point of view\
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5821) that is to the highest degree possible\
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5823) without any deficiency without any flaw\
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5825) so therefore allah's actions in terms of\
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5828) creating us\
[1:37:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5828) are not only good but the expressions of\
[1:37:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5831) who he is meaning\
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5832) he is the source of oh goodness and the\
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5835) fact that he created us as creatures who\
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5837) could freely choose to worship him and\
[1:37:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5838) do good\
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5839) and some even attaining the virtue of\
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5842) people like prophets\
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5844) and then as a result of doing that being\
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5846) giving eternal life\
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5847) in the presence of allah to pass an\
[1:37:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5849) eternity of intimate love and\
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5850) companionship\
[1:37:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5852) is actually the greatest story ever told\
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5854) and since allah loves all good\
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5856) it's clear why he would make the story a\
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5858) reality\
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5860) allah the this whole thing that's being\
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5862) played out\
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5863) is an expression of allah's names and\
[1:37:46](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5866) attributes of who he is in other words\
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5868) allah being\
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5869) the source of all goodness it's one of\
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5870) the greatest stories ever told\
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5872) allah loves good things great things and\
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5876) this story playing out in reality\
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5879) isn't it is an expression of his names\
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5881) and attributes\
[1:38:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5883) just like a painter he's going to\
[1:38:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5885) eventually paint\
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5887) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is a source of\
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5889) goodness\
[1:38:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5891) and this good great story is now being\
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5893) told is\
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5894) an expression of who he is and\
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5897) interestingly allah says in chapter 11\
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5898) verse 118\
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5900) if your lord had pleased he would have\
[1:38:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5901) made all people a single community but\
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5903) they continue to have the differences\
[1:38:25](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5905) except those on whom your lord has mercy\
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5909) for he created them to be this way he\
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5912) created them to be this way\
[1:38:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5914) i'm not going to unpack that for you too\
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5915) much but hopefully that answers\
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5917) the objections brothers and sisters\
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5920) so alhamdulillah\
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5924) where are we we are question times\
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5927) question time rather okay\
[1:38:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5931) so how long how are we doing with time\
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5934) what is the time\
[1:38:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5938) lost track of time\
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5941) um it's not telling me oh we've been\
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5944) going on for nearly one hour 40 minutes\
[1:39:05](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5945) subhanallah okay so\
[1:39:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5948) uh brother says let's take some\
[1:39:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5950) questions okay\
[1:39:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5956) okay there's a question here\
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5960) which is worse atheism or idol worship\
[1:39:22](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5962) well they're both the same\
[1:39:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5964) so in the islamic spiritual tradition\
[1:39:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5967) atheism\
[1:39:27](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5967) brothers and sisters is actually a form\
[1:39:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5971) of shirk\
[1:39:32](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5972) why because what we said about what\
[1:39:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5974) associationism is\
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5976) when we spoke about allah's oneness the\
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5978) fact that allah is worthy of worship\
[1:39:40](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5980) when we spoke about the fact that he is\
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5982) the sole creator maintain a sustainer\
[1:39:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5984) of everything that exists rejecting this\
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5987) or giving this to something other than\
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5988) allah\
[1:39:49](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5989) is a form of associationism is a form of\
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5991) idol worship is a form of associating\
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5993) partners with allah\
[1:39:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5994) so atheist what they do they reject that\
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5996) they reject the results create a sustain\
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5998) and master of everything that exists\
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=5999) but at the same time if they don't any\
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6002) and at the same time they may implicitly\
[1:40:04](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6004) or explicitly give those descriptions to\
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6006) other than allah like the universe\
[1:40:08](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6008) created itself or whatever the case may\
[1:40:09](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6009) be\
[1:40:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6010) and even if they don't give it those\
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6011) explicit descriptions to others\
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6013) by virtue of rejecting these\
[1:40:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6015) descriptions of allah subhanallah this\
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6017) is a form of associationism\
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6019) right but one would argue that you you\
[1:40:21](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6021) have to implicitly or even explicitly\
[1:40:23](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6023) you know give these descriptions to\
[1:40:26](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6026) uh something other than allah if you\
[1:40:28](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6028) don't give them to allah subhanahu wa\
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6030) ta'ala so\
[1:40:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6031) atheism is actually a form of it's it's\
[1:40:34](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6034) it's associating partners with allah\
[1:40:38](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6038) okay so let's take\
[1:40:41](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6041) a few more questions\
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6056) and second\
[1:41:07](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6067) uh just bear with me\
[1:41:10](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6070) there's not that many questions by the\
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6072) looks of it\
[1:41:24](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6084) um scrolling down just check out some\

[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6104) so it's very hard to find questions\
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6114) yeah i don't know why this happens you\
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6116) guys like have a discussion\
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6118) you're supposed to be at least listening\

[1:42:31](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6151) okay uh it looks like there's not much\
[1:42:33](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6153) here apart from you guys discussing\
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6170) all right then some of the questions are\

[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6182) more that needs to be said\
[1:43:03](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6183) but it is an introduction you know the\
[1:43:06](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6186) the more that needs to be said is going\

[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6253) because the accusation is that allah is\
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6255) morally inadequate\
[1:44:16](https://youtu.be/j6pO6OrWD8E?t=6256) and he's not maximally perfect and we're\
