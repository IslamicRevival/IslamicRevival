[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=14) upon you all  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=15) and welcome to sapient thoughts another  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=17) episode where here we discuss theo  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=20) philosophical issues we answer some of  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=21) the contentions that are brought against  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=23) islam and we offer  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=25) hopefully a robust case for the veracity  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=27) and beauty of islam insha'allah as a way  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=29) of life my name is anwar arafat and  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=32) today we are doing  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=34) episode 2 of our case study a  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=37) problematic hadith that seems to put  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=39) women down or that might seem  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=41) disrespectful or demeaning towards women  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=43) and a person might read this come across  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=46) it in some of the books and say hey wait  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=47) a second this is problematic  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=50) so how do we deal with this well as we  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=52) demonstrated the hadith of course it's a  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=54) little longer  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=56) if you haven't listened to the hadith  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=57) you can go back to that first episode um  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=59) in this episode we will apply our hadith  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=62) toolkit as we shared it where we we have  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=65) 10 tools so for this episode we're going  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=67) to go actually through the first five  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=70) in applying them to this specific hadith  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=73) in sha allah ta'ala  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=74) tool number one  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=76) is sincerity and remember we said this  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=78) is sincerity towards the material  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=81) sincerity towards whatever goal it is  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=83) sincerity towards your own biases  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=86) and obviously as muslims first and  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=88) foremost sincerity towards god allah  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=90) subhanahu ta'ala  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=92) sincerity towards the corpus  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=94) means that  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=97) when i read a hadith i don't take it by  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=100) itself i understand that as part of an  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=102) entire corpus a person easily can seize  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=105) on one hadith and take it out of context  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=109) and show hey look muslims say one two  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=111) and three  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=112) i can do this to almost any book i can  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=114) do this to almost any religion  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=115) um not only is it  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=118) unwise it's unjust right we're not being  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=121) fair to the material not being fair to  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=122) anything if i am muslim and i come  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=125) across a problematic hadith i have a  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=127) bias if i'm not muslim i also have a  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=130) bias if i'm an academic  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=132) i have a bias there as well what are  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=135) some of these biases if i'm muslim and i  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=137) read a problematic hadith that seems to  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=138) put women down  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=140) my sincerity to my paradigm is that wait  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=142) a second i know that the prophet sallam  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=144) doesn't put women down in fact there are  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=145) so many hadith in which he praises women  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=148) right he thanks them he's appreciative  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=150) he's respecting he's accommodating he's  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=152) doing all these things in fact arguably  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=154) no one throughout human history has done  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=156) more  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=157) for women giving them rights etc then  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=160) somebody like the prophet saws  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=162) especially 1400 years ago when nobody  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=164) was doing anything for one whatsoever so  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=166) i know that wait a second if i'm reading  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=168) this in a way that it could be putting  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=170) women down i know this goes against what  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=171) i already understand from my paradigm  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=174) because i am muslim and i am aware of  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=176) all these things  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=177) if i am an islamophobe  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=179) i already have my bias i'm going to  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=180) seize upon something like this and i'm  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=183) going to be like hey oh this is more  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=184) fuel to my fire but if i'm an academic i  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=188) know that i have to take everything  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=190) within its context that means i look at  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=192) it i analyze it i don't just take  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=195) something and run with it without  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=196) actually analyzing it correctly this is  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=198) why the toolkit is so important for us  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=200) and i believe that this toolkit will be  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=201) helpful whether you're a muslim or  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=203) you're not muslim meaning  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=205) how can we actually look at something  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=206) like this did the prophet saw salaam  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=208) really mean to say that women are less  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=211) than men in terms of their religion or  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=213) in terms of their intellect  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=216) let's analyze this let's test this just  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=218) because we have one hadith that seems to  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=220) insinuate this is this actually the case  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=222) if i'm an academic if i'm actually being  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=224) honest this is why sincerity is so  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=226) important that it makes us aware of our  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=228) own biases and it makes us aware of what  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=230) it is that we're actually reading so my  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=232) bias as a muslim is that i know that the  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=234) prophet sallam respects him so why would  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=236) he say this and by the way this bias  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=239) informs how we actually read the hadith  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=242) and we'll get into it when we do the  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=243) reread at the very end we'll go into  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=246) why did the prophet say this  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=248) what did it mean  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=250) and this is why sincerity is very  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=252) important so this is applying tool  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=254) number one  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=256) tool number two  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=259) tool number two  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=260) is  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=261) patience  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=264) now what does patience mean here  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=268) patience of course is in contrast to i  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=270) want an answer now we want everything  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=273) instantaneous  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=275) um i read it  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=277) and i want to run with it  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=279) a lot of times people will come and  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=280) they'll say  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=283) what does islam say about women  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=286) okay what does islam say about women are  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=289) deficient in their intellect and  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=291) and  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=292) religion  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=294) the thing is this is an incorrect  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=295) question  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=296) what does islam say  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=300) is  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=301) a problematic question we can look at  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=303) what does the quran say what does the  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=305) hadith say what do some scholars say but  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=308) islam has a huge concept is such a big  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=311) thing that islam  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=313) is represented through a lot of these  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=316) different avenues but there's  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=319) it's not that there's one there's not  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=320) one islam  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=322) but that the question itself is  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=324) inherently wrong this is how for example  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=326) the khawarij  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=328) the kharajits when they came to alibi  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=332) and they said we want the quran to rule  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=335) between us  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=337) right and so he brought or i think in  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=339) this generation it was  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=341) he brings a mushaf and he puts it in  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=343) between them and he says quran rule  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=346) between us  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=348) and everybody looks at him like he's  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=349) crazy  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=350) what they said this is a book it doesn't  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=352) speak he said that's what you asked  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=354) though  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=356) you asked for the quran to rule but the  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=358) thing is the quran is always read  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=361) through a human being meaning there's an  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=362) interpretation happening always  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=365) right whether we like it or not now i  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=366) can interpret it according to what i  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=368) know the prophet saws said i know what  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=369) some of the companions said etc which is  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=371) what we do all the time  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=373) but we're reading it through an  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=374) interpretation i saw something wonderful  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=377) where there was a lady who came to a  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=378) scholar  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=380) and she said what is the what is the  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=382) ruling in my case i think it was an  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=383) issue of divorce  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=385) right on a certain ayah  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=388) and so the scholar told her well i can  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=390) tell you what  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=392) allah says or i can tell you what the  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=393) quran and sunnah says  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=396) she says no tell me what is says and the  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=399) man got upset he's like what i am  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=401) telling you that i have the quran and  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=403) sunnah and you're telling me shafer she  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=405) says no  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=406) what you're going to tell me is your  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=408) interpretation of the quran and sunnah  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=410) and when you quote michelle it's his  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=412) interpretation of the quran and sunnah  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=414) both of you guys are interpreting  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=416) as he says i trust his interpretation  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=418) over yours  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=420) he's a big imam i don't know who you are  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=422) basically she's saying  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=423) and that's interesting thing because we  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=425) have to realize that it's always taken  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=426) through that lens so we have to have  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=427) patience when it comes to we want  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=429) instantaneous answers we want to know  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=431) what does islam say about women that's a  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=433) big question  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=434) right let's look at what are some of the  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=436) verses say what are some of the how do  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=437) you say what do some of the scholars say  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=438) etc so patience when applying this  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=440) toolkit we can't automatically just  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=443) write off something because we don't  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=445) like it or don't agree with it from the  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=447) outset there might be something going on  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=449) and in fact in this case there is  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=450) something else going on  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=452) so that's tool number two  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=454) tool number three is to talk to someone  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=457) of knowledge  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=458) and in this case i would encourage  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=460) anybody if you come across a problematic  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=462) hadith one of the best ways to overcome  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=464) it is to ask somebody of knowledge and  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=466) in this case we did we consulted many  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=467) scholars they offered their  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=468) interpretations and their takes which  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=470) was great and we'll share them inshallah  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=472) at the end  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=473) of this whole scenario so we already did  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=475) that but we don't want to get ahead of  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=476) the gun here tool number four knowledge  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=479) of arabic  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=481) we said knowledge of the prophetic  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=483) language in this case it would save the  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=485) person so much headache because as i  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=487) said the translation is outright  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=489) incorrect so let's pause and go back to  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=492) the translation inshaallah  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=494) the translation of the problematic so  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=496) we're only going to go over the  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=497) problematic or one of the problematic  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=499) um phrases is where he says  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=503) in arabic  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=512) now it was incorrectly translated as i  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=515) have not seen anyone more deficient in  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=516) intelligence i'm sorry i have not seen  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=518) anyone more deficient in intelligence  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=521) and religion than you  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=523) so this is sentence number one and then  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=525) sentence number two he says a cautious  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=526) sensible man could be led astray by some  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=528) of you now it's right off the bat in  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=531) arabic it was one complete sentence and  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=533) in english they translated it into two  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=535) which caused a big problem  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=537) meaning it's as a statement and not as a  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=539) thing let's look at another translation  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=541) this is the translation of mishkatun  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=543) that appears for us in the english  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=546) translation and what did he  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=548) that same phrase how was it translated  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=550) here  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=551) he said  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=552) so look at how different the translation  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=554) is among women who are deficient in  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=557) intelligence and religion i have not  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=560) seen anyone more able to remove the  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=561) understanding of a prude man than one of  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=564) you  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=565) this is a completely different meaning  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=568) okay let me repeat this again he says  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=570) among women who are deficient in  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=573) intelligence and religion i have not  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=574) seen anyone more able to remove the  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=577) understanding of a prudent man than one  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=579) of you  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=580) meaning this is sarcasm  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=582) here he's being sarcastic in that other  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=585) translation he's stating facts  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=588) huge difference between sarcasm and  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=591) facts and by the way a person might ask  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=592) wait was the prophet ever like um  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=596) sarcastic or ever he was mentioning it  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=598) here trying to highlight the irony  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=602) that despite women being deficient  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=605) supposedly being deficient in their  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=607) intellect and in the religion they can  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=609) lead  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=610) a wise and intelligent man astray  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=615) so he's saying maybe they're not so  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=617) deficient if they can lead somebody  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=619) who's  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=619) more intelligent than them how can they  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=622) lead them astray  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=624) so that's that's uh something that will  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=626) give light inshallah to what is actually  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=628) going on here's another translation this  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=630) translation i thought this is the  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=631) translation of sunan of numaja  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=635) and this is narrated by  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=637) omar but the same thing it doesn't  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=638) mention the first part about the khutba  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=640) but it just talks about how he comes to  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=643) the women  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=644) and then he tells him this is what he  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=646) says i have never seen anyone  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=649) lacking in discernment and religion more  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=651) overwhelming to a man of wisdom than you  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=655) very simple straightforward this is the  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=656) translation of the same now in arabic  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=658) they're all the same  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=660) men  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=663) very good  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=664) so here they translated it as  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=667) i have never seen anyone  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=669) lacking in discernment instead of  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=671) intellect he uses the word discernment  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=673) here and religion more overwhelming to a  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=675) man of wisdom than you  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=678) meaning you're able to over overwhelm a  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=680) wise man despite  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=683) that deficiency obviously he's saying  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=685) that it's technically or in reality it's  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=687) not a deficiency even though technically  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=690) there is a deficiency and we'll talk  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=691) about what it means actually by this so  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=693) as you can see translation makes a huge  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=695) difference and in some of these like i  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=697) said the one of  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=699) unfortunately is completely wrong in  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=702) some of the other versions like we said  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=705) um  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=706) is okay  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=708) the translation the typical one that's  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=709) given  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=710) he says  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=711) in spite of your lacking in wisdom and  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=714) failing in religion you are depriving  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=716) the wisest of men of their intelligence  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=720) okay so again irony it says in spite of  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=723) your lacking in wisdom and failing in  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=725) religion now failing and religion is  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=726) completely wrong it doesn't use that  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=728) word you are depriving the wisest of men  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=730) of their intelligence okay  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=732) translation matters  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=734) and unfortunately the translations are  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=736) out there are not perfect these are  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=737) human endeavors  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=738) sometimes they get it right often they  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=740) get it wrong  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=742) in this case that  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=744) mistake  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=745) has led a lot of people to have issues  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=748) with this and i completely understand  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=749) that and in fact i'm sympathetic and  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=750) empathetic towards that  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=752) um  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=753) and this is why  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=755) tool number four when you can access the  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=758) original arabic it solves so many  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=760) problems you're not reading it through  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=761) someone else's translation someone  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=762) else's take on the hadith you're reading  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=764) it through  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=765) what did the prophet saw actually say  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=767) this is why it's so important for us to  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=769) to kind of realize this inshallah ta'ala  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=771) will stop here  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=773) and we will go to the  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=776) next tools inshallah in the next video  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/eHsv5BLwGmI?t=778) we'll see you guys then assalamualaikum
