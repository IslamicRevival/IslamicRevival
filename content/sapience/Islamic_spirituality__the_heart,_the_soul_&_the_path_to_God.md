[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=112) road to disease of the heart  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=114) ostentation which is real which is blame  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=117) with the jealousy Kippur which is  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=119) arrogance and also a job which is kind  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=122) of self amazement and we're gonna go  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=124) into those how to do those and also to

[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=130) with these matters because everything  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=131) you see  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=133) festered in the real world manifested in  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=135) our lives is a derivative of our state  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=138) of being our state of HA and this  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=141) includes our politics this includes the  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=143) way we treat each other this includes  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=145) maybe the Baraka or the lack of it that  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=147) we have in our lives  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=148) this includes our unity as Ahmadis  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=151) includes the way we deal with our  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=152) parents and family this includes  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=154) everything everything we do really is  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=157) the derivative of our state of being of  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=160) our state of heart and this is why I  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=162) believe this is the most important  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=164) YouTube life that I would ever do  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=166) because it's focusing on something so  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=169) important because sometimes we always  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=170) focus on strategy we focus on I don't  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=174) know you know these different type of  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=176) methodologies but at the end of the day  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=178) and the crux of the matter is if your  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=181) heart is not sound if we don't have the  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=184) class if we do things with arrogance if  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=186) we have hazarded jealousy if we have  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=189) ostentation drea if we have this form of  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=192) self amazement this our job then there  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=194) will be no Baraka and it's more like  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=197) this is what your state of being is is  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=199) how you relate to yourself others and  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=201) Mark and this all we have to focus on  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=203) the simple on topic because if this is  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=206) not right and everything else is is  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=209) wrong from that view so sure a below

[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=398) which won't come as a surprise to you  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=403) listen mr. Vieau audience tonight is  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=405) actually the spiritual heart and though  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=409) this is something living that more and  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=413) more people are becoming aware of that  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=416) actually the spiritual heart is in one  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=419) sense the build and the end in fact a  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=423) spiritual heart is the locus of the  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=427) divine you're familiar obviously with  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=432) the hadith in in Sahih Muslim and I'm  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=436) sure your audiences as well the audience  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=438) is is what we're the prophets of Allah  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=440) and Allah says in raha young Veronica  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=445) what is super Riku  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=447) well acting young through in-app Hulu  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=449) become Malik indeed God doesn't but he  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=457) looks at your hearts and your actions  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=461) the heart to see if it's full of love of  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=464) Allah sincerity to God commitment to him  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=468) surrender to him loving submissions in  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=470) him and the actions to see if those  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=473) actions are in conformity to a large  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=477) revelation to what the Prophet SAW Allah  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=479) Miley was so important of religion  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=482) worship and Submission so the divine  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=485) gazes on the actual heart and in fact  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=488) it's the heart that sees the spiritual  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=492) heart that sees or doesn't see it's the  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=497) spiritual heart the program teaches us  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=499) that has to choose vision or lacks the  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=502) true vision so for example in sort of an  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=506) edge Allah Allah says  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=519) haven't they travelled through the earth  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=521) and they traveled through the land and  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=524) have they hearts by which they  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=527) understand or ears by which they hear  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=538) but it is not the heart of the eyes in  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=541) the head that go blind rather which is  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=544) the hearts in the chest but become blind  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=548) and there are that speakers are the  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=554) heart going blind and once the heart is  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=557) flying so that alone just reinforces how  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=566) you started off this session by saying  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=569) that really the inward spiritual matters  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=572) the matter of the spiritual artistry and  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=574) soul is in one sense the be all and end  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=579) and it's something that I think it might  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=585) be safe to say or at least fair to say  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=589) that we don't really give enough  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=593) attention back in the mid eighties when  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=597) I kind of started my journey in Islam I  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=601) was born into a Muslim family but I'm  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=605) talking about when you become  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=606) consciously the idea of the the inward  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=615) law and the importance of the heart it's  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=619) not there I think every Muslim at some  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=622) level into its that the spiritual heart  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=625) is important and it has its place and it  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=628) has to be a relationship  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=631) I don't think convert would be oblivious  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=637) to this but it probably not as clear in  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=641) our minds as it should be and they're  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=644) not centrally enough in our practice as  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=646) it ought to be I think that's really a  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=650) fair thing to say for for many Muslims  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=653) and and when I started out it was almost  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=657) like this and by the end of the 90s  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=662) coming into the new millennium more and  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=665) more people  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=667) speaking about this while teaching these  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=670) immoral nobles came out to help help the  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=673) cause in Charlotte but in that sense  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=675) there is a lot of progress that has been  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=678) been made but it's still an issue it's  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=688) still an issue I'm getting some notes  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=695) from my my wife saying that people can't  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=698) hear and this tapping on the screen or  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=702) this pad sound sorry sounds yeah I mean  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=710) the tapping sound okay okay so people  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=716) can hear it's just the tapping sound I  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=718) don't know how to do with that  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=719) everything is fine on my end going on my  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=723) and sure I think we should just carry on  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=725) anyway  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=726) we'll find a way to sort out insha'Allah  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=730) just try any time maybe raise your voice  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=733) a little bit more each other okay so so  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=738) today we're at the stage where I think  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=740) especially when they become more  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=742) conscious or wanting to practice their  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=745) needs their religion they are aware that  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=747) there is this important element of  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=749) spirituality of the inward law of inward  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=753) purification but then we come to the  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=756) issue of how where you know where does  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=760) one begin one begins by first really  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=763) understanding what a last one time has  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=766) said about the heart once we have an  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=769) overall awareness of the spiritual  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=772) technology of the heart let the fan of  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=775) the Scimitar go out of it go out of  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=777) their way to try to explain so for  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=781) example the Quran says and it's  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=782) something that the verse that you  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=784) alluded to right at the beginning young  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=790) people in sunny that day meaning the day  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=794) of judgment will neither wealth nor  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=796) children will avail anyone except he who  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=799) comes to Allah  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=800) or people bring to God a heart set up on  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=805) saline somehow nama : saline but what is  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=810) this saline cold what is this sound'  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=813) wholesome heart it's a heart that is  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=816) filled with filled with a love of Allah  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=820) filled with the fear and awe and the  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=823) majesty of God filled with the hope of  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=825) Montana filled with love of the prophets  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=828) awesome and love of imitating his way  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=831) fill his yearning for alone hereafter  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=835) over and above living in this material  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=838) world and these these descriptions of  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=843) the heart Allah doesn't want us to make  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=845) claims about it Allah wants us to live  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=849) it otherwise you know you go on Facebook  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=853) profile pages and there is my little

[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=863) whatever it's not really what I was  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=867) really asking us he's asking us is there  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=871) love in my heart of him  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=875) of the Dean of the Prophet SAW lost them  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=877) is their love of a light in the heart  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=880) such that it reforms my life and  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=884) connects me in a way with him that he is  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=888) pleased with not an egotistical love  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=891) this is how I think I should express my  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=894) love of God love of God for me is  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=899) sentiment sentimentality fluffiness you  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=902) know that fluffy spirituality let me  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=905) light a candle let me just feel good  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=906) that's not really what what allah subhan  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=910) allah is asking or last month I was  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=912) asking that my spirituality must be  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=915) rooted to submission it's so important  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=919) the heart and its spirituality and  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=922) Submission is so important that that  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=926) really we're in danger unless we come to  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=929) a last moment our Allah by His grace  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=930) with a kalamoon Saleem let me just say a  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=933) few more words about  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=934) heart and and then maybe I'll I'll stop  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=939) there for that for a time being so I  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=941) won't I hadith and it's a hadith again  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=944) you mentioned or alluded to Allah in the  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=947) field just in the mother either sulla  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=949) had soldiers who Kaluga way they're  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=951) faster better than just look aloo  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=953) allowed we and Allah here where he'll  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=956) come so handy thing Bihari or Muslim  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=959) indeed there is a piece of flesh in the  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=962) body if that piece of flesh behold and  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=965) sound all of the body is whole and sound  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=967) if that piece of flesh be diseased and  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=970) corrupted all of the body's diseased and  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=973) corrupted Allah well yeah well he'll  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=975) hold that piece of flesh is indeed the  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=978) heart the spiritual heart so depending  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=981) upon how corrupt or sound my heart sees  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=985) will reflect on the rest of my body it's  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=988) also vice versa as well let's stick with  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=991) this way when there is darkness in the  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=994) heart scenes disobedience rebellious  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=998) against God being lackadaisical in terms  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1002) of making that journey to Allah or just  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1008) metaphorically you driving so fast  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1010) through the through the the roads of  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1013) this world that the signs of Allah just  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1016) pass me by and I can't be bothered to  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1018) slow down and read them and and kind of  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1021) work out their implications when the  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1024) heart is that blinded that oblivious it  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1028) will show on the lens and ultimately  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1030) there's serious consequences  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1033) there is paradise and there is also hell  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1037) I mean that's a salt point that I'd like  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1040) to make and I keep on making listen and  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1044) people sometimes become slightly  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1047) surprised why one has to make this point  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1050) again and again that spirituality in  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1053) this round it's an unfortunate word is  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1056) really not the word that you know that  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1059) is a useful only because it can mean 101  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1062) different things 101 different people  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1064) but you know kind of a limited  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1067) vocabulary  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1068) what can we translate what can we use  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1070) instead so I'll use spirituality but  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1072) spirituality in Islam is not about  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1074) feelings it is it is linked in totality  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1081) with surrender and submission to Allah  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1083) but it's not that slavish grudging  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1087) submission I'll have to pray and have to  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1090) fast but rather it's a submission born  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1093) of joyous love of Allah summit on joyous  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1098) hope gratitude to Allah and it's but how  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1103) can the heart do that without knowing  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1105) the whole how can the heart do that  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1107) without trying  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1109) how can heart do that without certain  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1111) spiritual precepts being set in place so  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1116) this piece of flesh has to be really  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1119) safeguarded and the final point I'd like  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1121) to make just as an introduction the  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1125) Quran speaks about purification of the  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1128) heart or purification of the soul at the  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1130) moment they're one in the same thing and  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1132) there is no great practical benefit and  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1136) trying to work out the difference  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1138) between well what is the difference  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1140) between the spiritual heart and the  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1142) spiritual soul and if one does want to  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1144) dig into this even though I think it has  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1147) very little practical benefit then  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1150) marvels of the heart that a guy before  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1155) by Imam al-ghazali in his a Hannah  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1157) Medine that chapter of that book on the  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1160) marvels of the heart there's a  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1162) translation of it a beautiful  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1163) translation of it in English the marvels  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1166) of the heart one could read there and  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1169) it's a very long deep read where he  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1172) discusses the difference between the  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1173) spiritual heart and the spiritual soul  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1176) and I'm pretty sure that if most people  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1179) were to read it more than 70 people  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1182) would say masha'Allah  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1183) that's nice but it actually hasn't  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1185) changed the price of bread and that's  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1189) something we need to beware in the end  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1192) what Allah loves from us is Amal is  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1196) action whether is the action of actions  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1199) of the heart or the passion  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1201) of balloons and knowledge knowledge of  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1205) the heart knowledge is a means for those  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1208) two actions in fact he managed after he  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1211) says as you might recall is knowledge  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1217) that either produces an action of the  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1219) heart or an limbs or both and if it  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1221) doesn't produce any of those actions  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1223) it's not beneficial knowledge that's  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1226) really that's a really good rule of  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1228) thumb to kind of for us to keep in mind  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1234) midway through sort of having sworn by  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1240) various created objects then he swears  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1243) by the soul  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1252) by the soul and he who fashioned it or  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1255) formed it and then inspired it inspired  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1259) it with consciousness of what he's right  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1261) and wrong or what is wickedness and what  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1264) is righteousness successful is he who  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1266) purifies it and a failure is he who  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1270) ruins  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1271) subhanallah and a failure he is he who  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1274) ruins it and so what is how just ended  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1278) how what does the Quran say how do I go  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1284) around go around I'm getting a sound  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1289) heart how do I go about purifying my  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1291) soul well the pronounces one Levine a  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1295) jihad or FINA then at the end no home  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1299) sober Lana as for those who strive for  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1304) our sake literally means as for those  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1306) who strive in us but as for those who  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1310) strive for our sake we shall surely  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1314) guide them to our ways then at the  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1317) unknown so Berliner wonder the inner  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1319) jihad or FINA those who make jihad for  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1324) our sake we'll we will guide them for  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1327) our paths and this jihad yeah in this  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1330) context is a spiritual jihad jihad  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1333) there's no difference of  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1335) opinion about that amongst our scholars  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1337) and we call that in the language of  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1340) spirituality more jihad ah  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1342) and it's this mujâhidîn this spiritual  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1347) striving about which the prophets of  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1351) allah ISM said in the hadith and the  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1353) Muslim Atman and there's a similar  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1355) hadith in the Sun on our cinema d al  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1358) Mujahid man jihad or feed art in there  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1363) the mujahidin Oriya man man Javed enough  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1370) authority that is the one who strives  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1373) against his ego his nerves in obedience  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1377) to Allah if we take away obedience Allah  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1384) and obedience to his laws obedience to  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1390) the guidance that he sent His Prophet  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1392) SAS and with there is no spirituality  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1394) right we can we pull the tears wuhan and  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1399) we could swim as much as the next person  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1402) might swoon and you know and we could be  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1406) really tender but if there isn't any  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1410) obedience to Allah if Salaam simply says  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1415) that there is also no spirituality tell  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1418) us why because the spiritual warrior man  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1422) ja had enough civil Fethullah strives  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1427) against his soul he's eager in obedience  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1430) Allah whereas the ego one of the four  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1434) deadly enemies to this spiritual journey  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1437) is always trying to incite us to  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1441) disobedience to forget Allah to rebel  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1445) against his ways one has to roll up  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1448) their spiritual sleeves and strive  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1451) against the temptations and the  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1454) whisperings of the ego in order to obey  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1457) Allah subhana Allah  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1458) at least at the obligatory level of  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1462) obedience of Allah at least fulfilling  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1464) the obligations and keeping away from ya  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1467) arms anything above that brilliant but  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1472) at least people filling the obligations  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1477) and keeping away from the her arms which  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1481) is why the profits awesome says and  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1483) these will be my last to Haditha at this  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1485) point in there's a long hadith it's  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1492) called the hadith or Molly whoever shows  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1496) enmity to our ally of mine I shall be at  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1498) war with him to prophesy some say that  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1500) Allah said this in a hadith Qudsi and  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1502) then the hadith continues were malacara  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1506) by Illya Illya AB BB shaking I am in  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1510) mother of two who led my servant doesn't  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1514) draw closer to me this is what Allah  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1517) Sultana say my servant doesn't draw  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1520) closer to me with anything more beloved  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1523) to me then the obligatory duties I've  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1526) enjoined upon you my sermon doesn't drop  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1530) OSA to me with anything more loved by me  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1533) than the obligations so it's really  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1537) important that we are clear that  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1541) spirituality in Islam is not about  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1543) feelings and sentiments  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1545) it's about meaningful loving submission  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1550) and surrender that slowly and steadily  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1553) Springs from a joyous grateful loving  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1557) remembering heart and it starts step by  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1561) step but to use that phrase that Co V in  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1566) principle one starts with the end in  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1570) mind where do I want to end up I want to  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1576) might my goal is God my goal is Allah my  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1581) goal isn't Islam is an identity my goal  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1587) isn't Islam as culture my goal is an  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1590) Islamist anything my goal is Islam as  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1594) the path to Allah the only path now to  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1599) of Wow  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1600) if Allah isn't our goal we could be  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1605) reading religion with the wrong  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1607) dictionary so oblique a few genes and  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1612) more below be subtler than anything else  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1614) and if it's not about love of Allah and  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1616) he loves the obligatory deeds more then  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1619) what is spirituality about the flip side  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1621) of that the other way the prophet saw us  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1623) and said it duck in my having the corner  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1626) with a mouse in a hadith in Bukhari I  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1629) think it is it duck in my hardened I'm  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1632) God again so be aware of the Haram  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1635) matters the forbidden said kun number  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1638) than us and you will be amongst the most  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1641) devout of people the most pious the most  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1645) spiritual of people so it is really  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1648) about internalizing the outward laws and  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1656) their outward forms of submissions of  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1658) last honor to almond without the outward  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1661) laws of praying and fasting and various  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1663) other bits and pieces with that without  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1666) the outward law there's nothing to  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1667) internalize it is internalizing their  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1670) outward the outward prayer to make it an  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1673) inward prayer they out would faster make  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1675) it endured fast and it's intensification  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1678) of perception letting the heart become  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1681) even more aware of Allah and his  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1686) presence in our life so that when we're  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1689) looking out at the bigger world we can  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1692) just see the afar of Allah the traces of  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1695) Allah in everything the wind is blowing  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1698) at least in my end of the world it is  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1701) outside the window the wind is blowing  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1703) some big tree in someone's garden we can  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1707) think of it in terms of while we know  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1710) wind and atmospheric pressure in some  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1712) and so forth we might even think of it  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1714) in terms of the angels of the wings  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1717) doing God's command but higher than that  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1721) this is ultimately Allah who is the  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1726) mover and the shaker of everything that  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1730) perception and  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1732) into intensifying that perception is  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1735) what what Muslim spirituality is about  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1737) and trying to root that's perception so  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1740) it's not just on in Ramadan or on those  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1743) occasional beautiful gifted moments that  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1746) Allah gives us with spiritual openings  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1748) but it's general and constant that is  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1753) probably for most of us if you're if  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1757) your audience is anything like myself  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1759) then it's going to be a lifelong process  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1763) just to get even a few lad you know a  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1767) few rungs on the ladder but that is what  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1770) it's about  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1771) and we hope more in a lars grace to us  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1775) than our actually being able to do all  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1778) of what I've said what really caught me  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1791) emotionally was when you mentioned  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1793) joyous love and joyous hope to be filled  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1797) in one's heart that that was really  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1800) interesting and special way of  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1801) articulating it so in summary you know  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1807) true spirituality is to have a heart  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1812) that's full of joyous love and adoration  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1814) of allah subhana wa ta'ala and or to be  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1818) all with the majesty of Allah to have  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1821) the humility and not to be have this  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1823) kind of slave like you know grudging  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1828) attitude but to be have a service to  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1832) water that we're doing out of joy love  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1834) and joy is joyous hope that we are  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1836) serving and worshiping allah subhana wa  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1838) ta'ala and true spirituality really is  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1841) about first and foremost the ensuring  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1845) that we move away from the haram  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1847) forbidden things and that we do the the  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1850) obligations as you mentioned the famous  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1853) hadith Qudsi that you know Allah loves  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1856) the obligations become close to Allah we  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1859) we are on the path to Allah special log  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1862) when we focus on the obligations which  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1864) is extremely important  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1866) and a spirituality without being  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1868) submissive to Allah a spirituality  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1871) without preventing ourselves from going  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1874) to the Haram and a spirituality without  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1879) following the obligations that is not  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1882) true spirituality from them so we have  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1884) to you know make a demarcation between  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1889) sentimentalism and being you know crying  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1892) and having this like feelings of  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1894) niceness and oh my god that's so amazing  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1896) and deep and and and actually those  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1899) feelings actually lead to true  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1901) submission and lead to following the  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1903) obligations we can't be in a state of  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1905) the flow of heedlessness and delusion  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1907) that just because we feel something that  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1909) we want forgiveness and we and this this  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1912) verse sounds so nice but yet we don't  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1914) follow through the actions you know we  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1916) shouldn't be deluded to in thinking that  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1918) you know that's that spirituality  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1919) spirituality is is yes having those  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1921) feelings but those feelings actually  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1922) manifesting themselves into submission  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1925) I'm Jewish joyous hope and adoration and  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1928) love of Allah and following their  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1930) obligations and moving away from the  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1933) Haram and this is very very important so  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1935) this leads us nice nicely now to the  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1939) Sanctus locust I think is quote the best  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1944) the the true Center was going on here  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1948) which is the heart how to deal with some  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1950) of the key blemishes of the ha as we  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1952) mentioned such as our job self-amusement  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1955) kab of arrogance has that blameworthy  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1958) jealousy and array of ostentation and  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1960) we'll deal by the way I learned this  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1962) from music and all the other spiritual  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1964) disease is emanate from these four  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1966) spiritual diseases so really if you want  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1969) your heart to be in the right place to  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1971) follow the obligations properly to have  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1973) true submission to not fall for the  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1976) Haram and to elevate yourself on that  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1978) spiritual path which is continued  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1981) submission and deeper submission and  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1983) deeper level of two-panel water other  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1984) containing the obligations and this trip  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1987) began triack's then you need to start  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1989) dealing with some of these blemishes so  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1991) let's now deal with each of these  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1993) blemish blemishes as best as possible so  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1996) maybe let's start off with yet  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=1999) so uh before we do with the blemishes  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2001) could would it be a useful idea that I  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2006) mentioned the nufs the ego being one of  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2008) the four deadly enemies if we kind of  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2011) got the idea in the for getting things  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2014) that stop us from fulfilling the  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2016) obligations and and avoiding the harm  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2020) then disease of the heart as had equal  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2046) developing as a science or Arabic  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2047) language science around about the same  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2051) time the idea of the spiritual path in  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2055) Islam first get enough spirit occasioned  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2058) the soul so Luke spiritual wayfaring to  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2061) Allah or to solve  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2064) cheri oriented Sufism that was  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2067) developing as a science the Sahaba and  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2071) the alarm I mean this was a whole an  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2077) undifferentiated whole there was no  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2082) compartmentalization of fit or or  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2087) spirituality it was just as a whole but  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2092) when you have such a pure light when  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2098) it's not that pure when it's tainted  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2099) you're always going to get diffraction  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2101) and the white light breaks up through  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2105) the prism into its various colors there  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2107) you have that differentiation so now we  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2109) have this differentiation which is fine  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2112) it's it's okay so it's not a bad thing  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2114) at all and they kind of generally works  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2118) out that actually there are if you look  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2121) at the revelation the Quran and the  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2123) Sunnah there are four things there are  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2126) four main enemies to fulfilling this  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2130) inward and outward surrender of Allah  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2132) saw  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2133) at least by fulfilling the obligations  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2136) and keeping away from the Haram one of  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2141) my sheiks makes makes this point and he  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2143) makes it quite often one of my ships in  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2145) in in spiritual matters have a loner he  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2150) says that when many Muslims today hear  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2154) this that I'll keep away from the Haram  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2157) what comes into their mind more often  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2161) than not is well I don't murder I don't  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2164) see you I don't commit fornication for  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2168) example and therefore well what else is  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2170) there  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2171) I've kind of kept away from the Haram  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2173) and I don't eat I don't eat pork for  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2176) example I don't drink wine and mashallah  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2178) that's mashallah we if Allah has made  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2181) our lives like that we need to express  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2183) thanks subtle a Sardar for giving us the  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2186) grace and the kindness that keep away  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2188) from those prohibitions but they're not  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2190) the only prohibitions more often than  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2193) not other clear-cut prohibitions fill  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2198) our lives in a way that and this is not  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2202) an encouragement by any means in a way  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2204) that had I just had one bite of a Haram  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2206) pork sandwich it might have been less  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2208) sinful then actually the her arms that  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2211) come in my daily life so for example we  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2215) are a visual age I understandable we're  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2219) not like kind of nineteen thirties  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2221) Britain just listening in to the BBC  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2223) World Service on the radio and whatever  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2225) we're a visual culture but that does  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2229) obligate upon us mindfulness envision  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2233) mindful watching TV mindful watching  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2237) Netflix mindful watch I mean the ideal  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2239) would be TV Chuck Netflix but being  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2243) realistic and a sense of realism is that  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2247) for many people it's going to be there  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2249) in their lives so what is the obligation  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2252) the obligation has to be mindful  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2254) watching there are just things that is  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2256) hard for me to say even if it's just  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2259) common culture but it's around for me to  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2261) see I have to avert my gaze lower my  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2263) gaze switch the channel and end up old  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2266) being old school  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2267) but definitely avert my gaze and yet we  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2270) can actually watch TV in a way where  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2273) there's no mind for watching and haram  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2275) images are coming in to us well that had  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2279) on let's get stay for an hour or two  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2281) hours or mote you know however is  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2284) probably worse than sipping a glass of  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2287) wine or just biting into a pork sandwich  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2291) god forbid I'm mentioning these things  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2295) so that not not to become freaky  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2298) obsessed but just to show that how  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2301) Shaitaan has kind of distracted us and  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2305) blinded us to certain obvious things and  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2307) so for example one more example but  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2311) there are quite a few I'm not saying  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2313) there are hundreds but there are quite a  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2315) few the most obvious ones are with the  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2319) tongue it's very easy to back by to  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2323) slander to spread gossip in a way that  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2327) splits people and and all of those are  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2331) major sins there's those are those  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2333) aren't just sins there are major sins  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2335) but given more subtle examples let's  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2340) stick with a position that of the  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2341) jurists that one of two legitimate  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2343) positions that a lady a Muslim media can  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2347) show their face in her hands brilliant  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2351) fine but can a Muslim lady according to  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2357) the Koran when the Quran says that  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2359) referring to Arab women at the time of  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2362) the processin that the Quran says do not  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2365) stamp your feet in order to draw  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2367) attention to yourself the idea being  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2369) that they will many of them wore anklets  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2372) as a common custom ankle bracelets are  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2375) they called anklets ankle bracelets wear  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2377) little bells or jingles on them so if  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2379) you kind of statue fort or Iran you  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2382) could hear a little bit of jingles so  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2384) the Quran says do not stamp your feet so  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2388) as to draw attention to yourself now the  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2392) nature of the Quran is not saying that  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2395) that you this is only prohibited if  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2398) you're wearing ankle bracelets because  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2400) the idea  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2401) is not ankle bracelets as it is drawing  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2405) attention to ourselves in oneself in a  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2408) way that one shouldn't do or one doesn't  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2411) have to do so  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2414) a woman can shove her face and hands but  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2417) is it from is it pleasing to Allah that  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2423) a Muslim lady and this is not  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2426) questioning the rest of our Deen this is  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2428) just one issue and I suspect that many  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2433) other you know many well-intended  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2435) sisters as probably many well he tell  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2439) you brothers don't realize this but is  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2442) it permissible for a Muslim sisters who  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2445) maybe have a little bit of makeup on and  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2449) then have a profile pic on social media  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2453) that is where she would you know it's a  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2458) type of picture that she might show her  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2460) husband or her mum and dad but not  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2465) publicly which will draw attention to  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2468) herself and she doesn't have to be an  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2471) Einstein to know that that could happen  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2474) because the Quran also talks about men  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2478) being weak the Quran also talks about  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2481) men being weak so the Muslim woman's  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2483) voice is very beautiful then the Quran  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2486) says not not even happy the Quran says  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2489) that do not beautiful your voice because  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2493) in in the hearts of men there is  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2496) sickness well in the eyes and in our  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2499) eyes and even though we should be  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2502) lowering the gaze which is what the  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2504) obligation upon us but the obligation  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2506) upon a sister is not to have such a  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2509) profile pic for example and just imagine  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2512) these are the type of world and there is  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2517) no difference among surgeries they might  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2519) differ about how you know is it  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2521) absolutely Haram or buckles that Lima  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2524) but most will probably say it's Haram  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2527) okay but it's so being wrong there's no  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2531) doubt about it but look how it's become  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2534) just part and parcel  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2535) don't think that's all so keeping away  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2537) from the her arm needs to be an active  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2541) conscious thing through knowledge so  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2543) that her arms don't become normalized  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2546) better to commit her odd no he gets a  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2549) hard-on for which I can repent then to  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2552) try to twist the revelation and you know  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2557) torture it in a particular way Paul  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2562) calls it Guantanamo style Tufts here  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2565) that if you torture and prop the the  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2567) texts in a particular way you can get  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2569) the religious text to say whatever you  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2571) want them to say rather just know this  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2574) is the normative teaching of Islam I do  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2576) something around Allah forgive me for my  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2578) weakness and save me from myself  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2580) brilliant that is more pleasing that is  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2583) the spiritual path so it's really  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2585) important that in this halal and Haram  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2588) this that one we be alert to that we  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2593) regularly check ourselves and three one  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2597) of the best ways is to learn the basic  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2600) obligations from a mother and maybe once  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2605) a year and there are translations from a  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2628) few thing here basically the examples  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2634) you gave concerning the lowering the  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2638) gaze and being mindful of the way we  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2641) play ourselves that example in  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2643) particular is to give rise to the  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2646) consciousness that we must have sound  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2650) knowledge sound revealed knowledge in in  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2654) ensuring that we maintain ethical  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2660) Islamic normative practice and that we  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2663) keep to the obligations we move away  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2665) from the Haram and we don't fall into  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2668) their trap of  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2669) normalizing that which is blamed with is  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2671) that correct absolutely you're spot-on  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2674) and and there is for this context there  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2677) is an underlying spiritual purpose  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2679) because in the end the purity of the  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2682) heart of the corruption of the hearts  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2683) okay the heart either receiving right  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2688) from Allah or or pouting is very much  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2692) linked to the inroads of the heart the  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2695) heart the spiritual heart is affected by  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2697) what we see what we speak what we touch  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2700) what we smell normally it's for hearing  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2702) and the seeing that other the bigger  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2704) inroads and also to do with one's  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2707) private parts ones genitals  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2709) and what they do or don't do affect the  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2716) heart when a person commits a sin a  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2719) black state upon his heart if you bank  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2721) when disease than the black split State  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2723) offense but if it continues then the  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2726) black state continues to grow and grow  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2728) and grow until it covers the hole on  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2736) their hearts because of what they've  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2738) done because of the sins that they've  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2739) done so the heart can become encrusted  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2741) and once it becomes rusty over receiving  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2745) the light from Allah the light doesn't  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2748) penetrate and encrusted heart so the  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2752) crown here is your the question is how  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2754) do we uncross the unprocess sorry this  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2761) one here so the uncrushed wouldn't that  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2763) be towba it's dipped far thicker because  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2768) everything has a polish and the polish  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2770) of the high is the vicar of a lost power  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2772) I love less you absolutely you're right  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2774) you're absolutely right it has to be  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2778) sober regularly it has to be rich trying  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2786) to remember a whilst one solid foot or  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2788) no other reason it's a Polish but there  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2791) are 101 other reasons why because should  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2795) be done because it's one of the great  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2796) ways to to inspire the hearts of divine  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2800) love but yes  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2803) but the point thing is Shaitaan has  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2808) seduced many of us to thinking that I'm  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2813) actually okay I mean I can do better  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2815) religiously Islamic Lee but on the whole  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2817) I'm okay not realizing that actually  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2820) maybe maybe my kind of day-to-day life  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2823) is actually filled with quite a lot of  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2826) her arms it's a question that a lot of  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2829) people ask that a lot of people asked  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2831) I've been praying and fasting I've even  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2833) gone to three or four pilgrimages  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2836) I don't feel there I don't kind of get I  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2839) haven't got that kind of consequence  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2841) that kind of spiritual fruits that I  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2843) would have expected isn't there and the  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2846) spiritual masters quite often say well  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2848) it's so common that this question is  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2852) asked and and the answer is as common  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2854) which is many people will do good  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2857) religious needs they will especially for  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2861) example British Muslims are a lot laws  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2865) bless them that they will give a lot of  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2869) charity throughout the year I'd be  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2871) particularly in Ramadan we are and  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2873) handle our very generous communities of  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2877) people of Muslims so they will do good  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2881) but they might not keep away from the  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2885) Haram as they should and the example of  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2887) that one of my chefs said have though  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2889) that's harder is like getting the best  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2892) central heating system in the house get  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2894) getting the best boiler double glazed  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2896) windows and everything like that and  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2898) it's all perfect winter comes along very  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2903) biting winter and then once in their  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2906) room saying why is it so freezing in the  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2907) house so the first thought is Oh heating  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2910) isn't on but one goes and checks the  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2912) radiators boiling hot one goes and  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2915) checks the boiler it's pumping away as  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2917) it should so one scratches their head  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2920) and thinks why is why is the cold still  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2922) come in it it's because the windows are  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2924) open and it's let the chill in what  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2928) there's it's not that there's no point  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2930) but it defeats the point of having the  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2932) central heating on if I'm left all the  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2934) windows wide open  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2936) in its similar to doing good deeds  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2939) central heating on but leaving the  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2942) windows open during Haram and the  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2945) results of that chili Haram kind of kill  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2949) off any benefit of the of the heat on  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2951) the heating system I mean this day and  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2955) age a number of our bother  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2957) a number of spiritual masters have said  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2960) looking at our conditions that actually  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2963) this is a very major people out of their  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2968) lives a lot in his kindness will Raven  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2972) to us donnager a degree a level that had  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2976) had we been three four five hundred  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2978) years ago it would have been considered  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2981) a bit trivial a bit standing and basic  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2983) but for this day and age given the  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=2986) temptations given the difficulty the  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3005) work of a saint of God in this day and  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3009) age Spengler so what I'm gathering here  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3014) is as well is that there are spiritual  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3018) blind spots or knowledge blind spots  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3021) that we have that we need to be aware of  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3025) because sometimes we think you know I'm  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3028) praying five times a day everything is  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3030) funny but because of by virtue of maybe  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3032) our lack of knowledge  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3033) by virtue of our current society by  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3036) virtue of some things that are forbidden  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3039) that have been normalized and we think  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3041) it's okay those things can be a means to  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3044) darken our hearts we don't even know and  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3047) that absolutely and that becomes a blind  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3049) spot for us and we're thinking why is  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3052) nothing changing in my life I'm supposed  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3054) to be you know at least someone who is a  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3057) good Muslim but I'm not feeling it all  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3060) you know I'm facing calamities in my  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3062) life that maybe someone my standard  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3065) shouldn't face but the point is we have  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3067) to really  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3069) and that is really maybe a part of the  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3071) ego it's the spiritual ego which is the  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3073) worst type of Eagle because we think  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3075) we're okay but we're blinded to the  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3077) fiber all of a second your whole week is  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3079) full of haram/forbidden things and you  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3081) weren't even aware things that you say  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3083) things that you see I mean social media  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3086) is full of trauma and it's become  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3090) normalized and that is affecting our  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3092) heart you said these are windows into  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3093) our heart and it can a darken our hearts  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3097) and make it crusty okay so this is this  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3101) is great so how do we now leave this now  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3103) on to the full spiritual diseases and  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3105) getting some way into dealing with some  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3107) of these diseases the ego the nafs the  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3114) low enough takes us away from the  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3116) medians if we remember that dunya in its  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3120) material attractions is always enticing  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3122) us away what is the life of this world  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3125) except that play an amusement if we  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3129) recall also that Shaitaan okay works on  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3133) our weakness and whispers which is one  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3139) most spiritual master state the nufs is  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3143) the greatest enemy but if we look in the  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3146) Quran the enmity of the nafs is hardly  
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3151) mentioned in comparison to the enmity of  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3153) Shaitaan I mean Shaitaan compared to  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3156) nufs is mentioned hundreds and hundreds  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3158) of times over and they they square the  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3161) circle by saying that's because Shaitaan  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3164) whisper his whispers are more effective  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3167) to a weakened soul when that when the  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3170) person is at that egotistical level but  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3174) you know shape down you know physically  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3179) kapha oh you who believe enter into  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3180) Islam wholeheartedly  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3182) well that W Hotel Lotti Shaytan and  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3184) don't follow the footsteps of Shaytan in  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3187) the home look on duma beam and so he  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3189) because he to use a clear avowed enemy  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3192) but notice how and i know you you know  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3196) this but it's interesting how allah says  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3199) will add W Hottel Watty shake on  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3202) and don't follow the footsteps of the  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3205) devil of Satan  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3206) why not and do not follow Satan because  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3210) quite often being the strategist he is  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3214) and he's been around a long time as well  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3216) longer than we have anyway he kind of  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3219) knows that if I kind of like give them  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3222) an obvious thing many religious people  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3224) say no no way so let me just lead them  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3228) bit by bit what the word to Shaitaan so  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3230) Allah says don't follow even the  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3232) footsteps of a time so the nature of  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3236) Allah's mercy in the Sharia the out here  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3239) by Sharia I'm talking about the outward  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3241) law the outward law is there to preserve  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3243) inward purity and just to to keep the  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3248) path of salvation or sanctification open  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3251) to us it we can either look at a large  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3255) area as these are some rules that are  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3259) just kind of pushing me down or we can  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3261) see the Sharia as joyous gift that saves  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3265) us from us so Allah is not only in this  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3271) case following the footsteps of Shaytan  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3274) all right so there is zina fornication  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3277) adultery okay  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3278) clearly her okay but don't follow the  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3281) footsteps normally one doesn't just zero  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3284) to the end there are steps okay a nod  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3288) and a wink flirtatious speech so on and  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3291) so forth as is as is known so being  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3296) alone so actually those things become  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3299) prohibited as well because more often  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3304) than not they lead to the end thing so  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3308) Shaitaan and the last one is how wins  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3310) and desires which is probably what  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3314) characterizes us today even religious  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3317) people even Allah forbid us as share  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3321) some days and of stars and sometimes  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3326) wins and his eyes come in the way I mean  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3329) I don't want to talk about certain  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3332) things which accounts accounts of  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3334) culture because I might lose myself  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3336) your media following rain and things  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3339) which are clear-cut around I mean some  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3342) of this is the fault of chefs and  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3344) scholars like myself okay and teachers  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3347) like myself who we should be making it  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3351) clear on the pulpit what is hard on we  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3353) don't have to say in an aggressive way  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3355) we don't have to wag our finger we can  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3358) say it lovingly but it needs to be said  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3361) and if we remain silent like for example  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3365) on the profile pics pictures if we  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3368) remain silent  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3369) why shouldn't many of the lamest  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3372) instinct it must be okay but once we  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3377) start down that road it's a slippery  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3380) slope so how are the answers have you  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3385) not seen him who takes his power as is  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3387) God we have every day so those are the  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3398) four enemies that stop us from  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3400) fulfilling the obligations or throwing  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3403) us into the Haram that's what they call  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3405) the outward which I had there to strive  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3409) against those four enemies the ego the  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3414) devil worldliness and force winds and  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3418) desires to make it obedient so that  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3422) wearing a penis  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3422) I lost my talent there is an inward  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3425) Mujahid's Pareto struggling which is  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3428) taming and training the heart and this  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3430) is well come on to the four diseases  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3431) taming and training the heart through  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3434) gratitude through love through  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3436) remembrance of Allah such that the heart  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3439) becomes attached to a la Santa Anna  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3441) learns to be present with Allah so to  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3446) have hold all of what la semaine to Anna  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3447) and obviously essential to this is the  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3450) idea of restraining the heart from  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3452) certain things so the out of mujahadin  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3456) do the obligations keep away from the  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3458) prohibitions but we're going to have to  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3459) spiritually struggle against those four  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3462) enemies the inward wa ja'a de is  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3466) training the heart  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3469) Shuker muhabba and vicar sugar mahadba  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3474) vicar gratitude love divine remembrance  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3478) so that it becomes attached on last  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3481) month are we fall in love with God but  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3486) that and it's a circular thing the more  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3489) we do of the inward because the more  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3492) success Allah will give us in the  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3494) outward Messiah and the more we do that  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3497) out with Mojang with consciousness of  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3500) the inward will deepen our inward  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3503) Madonna but if we only do that outwards  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3505) not without the consciousness of the  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3507) inward law we could end up and God  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3511) forbid like carnage outwardly very very  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3516) rigid on the outward law but wow they  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3519) were really devoted some think you know  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3521) it okay good so so this one getting now  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3526) so what we focused on in this section is  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3528) the kind of the four main obstacles in  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3535) obedience to Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3539) one way of protecting all of that is by  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3542) following the obligations first and  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3543) foremost the obligations that have been  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3546) expressed in the Quran in the prophetic  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3548) tradition such as your five daily  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3550) prayers giving you as a car going to  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3553) Hajj the five pillars etc etc and the  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3558) kind of enemies to that enemies choose  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3562) being submissive and obedient almost  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3564) panel vitally is the hawa is your your  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3567) desires is chafe on himself is  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3570) worldliness and the other one was your  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3575) ego or your whims so yeah wins ego  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3579) worldliness devil and then okay good  
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3583) whims ego wordless and the devil so  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3586) those are the kind of barriers to  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3588) fulfilling the obligations and therefore  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3591) that is a barrier to connecting  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3594) ourselves were lost Hannah water Anna  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3595) being submissive to Allah and being  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3597) actually unmasked ripped apart and now  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3599) we're moving on to the inner  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3602) kind of spiritual diseases maja we  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3605) mention the beginning Rhea ostentation  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3608) or jobs of amazement hazard blameworthy  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3611) jealousy and Kippur and arrogance and  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3613) those are linked so when you focus on  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3616) inward it will deal with things like  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3618) protecting yourself from Shaitaan from  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3621) lowly desires from worldliness and from  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3624) your ego so there is a kind of almost  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3627) like a symbiotic relationship between  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3629) the disease the heart and what you just  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3632) and the four main enemies to  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3636) submissiveness and being connected to  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3638) allah and following the obligations  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3640) query good so okay great so now let's  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3654) because we've done an hour would you  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3656) believe it it's felt like fifteen  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3658) minutes we have around 15 minutes  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3662) because when it comes to lives and even  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3664) recordings people have a short yeah so  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3670) people need to you know the attention  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3671) span in these days and aid these days us  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3674) these days and this age is limited so  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3677) let's move on to the spiritual use of  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3680) the heart now and it's like in the  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3682) future we could unpack more other human  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3685) on some of these topics even even more  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3687) in sha allah so let's say we start with  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3690) yourself amazing yeah so people like  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3695) imam al-ghazali even others they say  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3698) really you can boil down the spiritual  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3702) disease it's in the four main ones four  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3707) main spiritual diseases of the heart  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3710) which if we began to take care begun to  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3714) take care of these four diseases  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3715) it would probably stop other diseases  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3718) sprouting because all the other diseases  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3721) sprout from these form in fact this is a  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3725) inherited tradition because if you look  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3727) at Galen and some of the the ethical  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3730) writings of the Greeks and they speak  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3732) about these four as well within their  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3735) own friends  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3736) reference as well so it's kind of a  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3737) universal thing and they tend to be as  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3741) you quite rightly mentioned Aria showing  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3745) off or ostentation in acts of worship  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3749) which if you don't mind if I can just  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3751) start with that which is the one that  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3754) actually in this social media age it  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3757) becomes more challenging than ever  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3760) before showing off a Rihanna from the  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3766) world of art to be seen  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3769) I want my apps to be seen so someone  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3773) will Pat me on the bank sing my praises  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3777) give me accolades whereas my goal should  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3782) be purely for Allah and his pleasure and  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3785) whatever reward he gives are now now  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3788) also perhaps looking for reward and  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3791) praises of other people or worse than  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3794) that that was my whole intention in the  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3798) beginning people but Allah that's a  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3802) worse for more free art but oh yeah also  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3804) is otherwise my gold and people also  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3807) become Michael we we need we need to get  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3810) to a stage matter look kindly upon us  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3814) but I buy a lot is my goal  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3817) full stop that's the end of the sentence  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3819) there's nothing else to it in this  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3824) [Applause]  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3825) difficult you know when we look back I  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3830) mean I say this with with with  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3832) trepidation I I say he's feeling to be  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3835) perfectly honest actually I say he's  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3837) feeling a bit hypocritical because when  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3839) we look back at the end at the early  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3843) Muslims our venerable Soloff they would  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3851) pass the buck so some women someone  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3856) asked one part one one of the scholars  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3859) of the early of early summer fucktwat he  
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3862) was going ask that person going ask that  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3865) more people and then the person will go  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3867) to that Mufti and that will still say go  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3868) and ask that  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3869) and we have two or three reports which  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3872) say I went and did that until I came  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3874) back down to the first class and who  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3876) then said oh I can answer it now because  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3878) no one else has answered it I can't  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3880) leave a vacuum there's an obligation to  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3883) but there I the idea was that they had  
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3886) such an intense connection with Allah  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3890) subhana Allah  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3891) in terms of their fear and their fear  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3895) unlike our fear our fear it might be and  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3898) it's a healthy fear out there might be a  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3901) loss punishment and Hellfire and that's  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3903) a healthy fear and that is a hyeme and  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3906) perhaps we don't have that enough  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3909) perhaps we don't have that enough  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3911) because my my Aslam my dower now is add  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3915) our that only talked about love of Allah  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3918) I do want to talk about fear of Allah  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3920) because my upset some people not what  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3925) people want to hear  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3927) but they've so it says healthy fear but  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3930) they their their fear of Allah was less  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3932) fear of the punishment of the Hellfire  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3934) and more fear of that he would turn away  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3938) from them and not be pleased with them  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3940) even alleged speaks about the fear of  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3943) the Sullivan that the affair wasn't so  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3945) much of hellfire but of the lord not not  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3950) allowing them to see him on the day of  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3952) judgment not raising them up in his  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3955) presence because I loved around that  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3958) level fears nothing than to displease  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3961) the beloved and because of their intense  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3966) fear they were keen to answer religious  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3972) knowledge unless push came to shove that  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3978) reflects on their sincerity that it was  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3982) so much for Allah from home to harbor  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3985) even though jolzi so hung no jolzi kind  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3991) of he says that one of one of the early  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3994) Muslim scholars who used to be a  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3996) religious teacher in the mosque he used  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=3998) to teach and there would be a few people  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4000) a handful of students he had  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4003) and one day he came to the Masjid and  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4004) there were um there were tens of people  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4008) in his class like twenty thirty forty he  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4012) got up and he left he didn't teach  
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4014) because he didn't want to be known now  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4018) it is true that different great the  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4024) great scholarly state from the past did  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4026) manifest sincerity in different ways  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4028) they didn't oh well I've got class of  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4032) fifty now I'm not going to teach know  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4034) some people which he can classes of a  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4036) thousand right but then that wasn't in  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4039) sincerity but it is a matter of taking  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4041) stock of our own selves or somehow I was  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4049) going to put you on the spot but let me  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4051) try to generalize this or for example I  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4058) mean it's just it's just unimaginable  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4063) today for someone who has a high social  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4067) media profile to continue digging up  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4072) their themselves well I've got fifty  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4075) thousand social media followers you get  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4079) to the hundred thousand mark and then  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4081) 150 thousand then it's totally against  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4088) the grain grain its counterculture for  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4091) someone of such a high profile to say  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4093) that okay but I'm actually under a lot  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4096) less move these followers actually I  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4099) believe this this ally of this person  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4104) should be exposed to the Muslim  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4106) community because they can give  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4110) something icon we just don't think like  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4113) that anymore thinking like that is a  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4116) gift of sincerity true sincerity but we  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4121) don't because we want to hug all of the  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4124) image all of the attention in Amish  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4128) mafia red Iran who says never did a  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4132) debate with someone except that  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4136) I hope that the truth would be making  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4138) manifest on his tongue on the tongue of  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4142) my opponent because Shanthi wasn't  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4144) interested in being patted on the back  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4146) he was just interested in the in God's  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4149) truths being made manifest to humanity  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4153) and therefore it doesn't matter who says  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4156) it so much so that he also says this be  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4160) centered say both of these I say all the  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4163) iterations that I would love for my work  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4169) to be spread without my name being  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4173) attached I mean that is in class totally  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4178) Spitz of ego it is just so unimaginable  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4185) this is this correlation see me man okay  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4188) who hails from the from the prophetic  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4190) tribe if not famous because he hails  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4193) from the prophetic tribe i love because  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4203) so the chef what we're saying here what  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4207) you're saying here is a real sensation  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4209) is doing acts of worship for anything  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4214) other than allah so in order for our  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4218) acts of worship to be sound we have to  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4222) be doing it solely for allah subhanho wa  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4225) taala which could mean solely because he  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4228) is worthy of the act by virtue of the  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4230) fact that he is worthy of worship and  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4231) that we love him it could be for His  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4234) divine reward and it could be to prevent  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4237) ourselves from the Hellfire we could do  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4240) for any of those reasons or all of those  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4242) reasons but the berea is when we do it  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4245) for something other than those reasons  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4247) and you've given great examples in our  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4249) sullivan applies predecessors on you  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4253) know the way they would love god's truth  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4256) to be manifest was very possibly said  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4258) god's choose to be manifest even if  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4260) they're wrong so they have given up  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4262) their right to be right for the sake of  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4265) allah because they want God's truth to  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4267) be manifest  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4269) and you mentioned examples of social  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4270) media you've mentioned examples of our  
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4274) scholars and a scholarly tradition where  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4275) they would love the work to be available  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4279) to everybody even if even if their name  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4282) is not on it yeah and this is extremely  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4285) powerful so and and urea is very  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4288) dangerous because it means our actions  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4291) our acts of worship are not accepted and  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4296) it's not only that they're not only  
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4300) rejecting but it's a major thing yes  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4304) from the Somalia we're all in trouble  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4312) then we're all in trouble social media  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4314) you know I always say like social yeah  
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4316) yeah social media if the pies producers  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4321) were alive today I think the default  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4323) would position would be that social  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4325) media is haram ie honestly because you  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4330) know look I'm gonna give you an insight  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4332) here right I'm supposed to be involved  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4334) in public work the Dawa bla bla bla bla  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4336) bla but I'm telling you something there  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4340) are there are pran prominent and popular  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4342) people on online their criteria for  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4346) success consciously and I would even  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4349) argue subconsciously and I've had these  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4351) discussions behind the scenes the metric  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4353) for success is how many views how many  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4358) likes absolute answer to answer and and  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4362) and that is going to destroy us indeed  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4365) an ad to answer that it's not just how  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4369) many likes but how many bottoms on seats  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4372) can we get for example for a conference  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4375) not the quality of the speaker yes and  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4380) what that does is if from that if from  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4384) top downwards that's that's the rot  
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4387) that's really worried  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4392) we need to reevaluate this whole thing  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4395) I agree socialism urea how do we do that  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4398) I have no idea but you're right  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4405) is really important one of the one of  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4407) the ways just the so it might for  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4409) example my father pray let's just say my  
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4411) father okay when I end up played my  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4413) father say in Gemma in in public how is  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4418) that - when I maybe have to play my  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4420) father play not in public force before  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4422) whatever if there is a similarity then  
[1:13:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4425) inshallah that's indicative of sincerity  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4428) of some level of sincerity if it's that  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4431) very usually my public prayer is far  
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4436) more pious outwardly then my private  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4439) prayer there is a huge concern there and  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4444) one of the ways we try to do this is  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4446) what the spiritual masters say just  
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4448) sincerity is is is to forget creation by  
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4454) focusing on the Creator if creation well  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4457) if people weren't there pretend there  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4460) was no one on this earth and I was made  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4461) to pray a prayer how can I show off in  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4463) front of anyone because there isn't  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4464) anyone to show off in front of okay  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4466) great so this is one of the solutions to  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4468) ostentation one of the solutions  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4470) ostentation is to forget the creation  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4474) and to remember the creator by really  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4477) understanding that your reward and  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4482) everything is from Allah subhana WA  
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4484) Ta'ala and what Allah can give you no  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4486) one can can convene can replace that one  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4489) can change that and it's very important  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4492) for us to have an author of centric  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4493) mindset that you know if you're doing  
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4496) these acts of worship for other than  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4498) Allah you are destroying your Oscar  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4500) which is eternal and compared to a  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4503) finite dunya a finer worldly existence  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4506) is nothing I mean in my train - a tea  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4510) from a from infinity it's still infinity  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4513) mathematically so it's actually  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4515) meaningless it's meaningless to do these  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4523) actual worship for other than Allah so I  
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4525) have an arc eccentric mindset and have a  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4527) good centric mindset right you imagine  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4531) that creation is not there and it's just  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4534) Allah and you're doing it just for Allah  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4535) and reaffirm within your mind in your  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4538) heart that your your actual state in the  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4543) Asura in the hereafter is contingent on  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4547) this issue so excuse me so that's one of  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4552) the solutions Turia so because of time  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4555) let's move on to the next one that you  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4558) wanna talk about yeah now this one  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4561) itself oh my god you know when I learned  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4563) this I think about six months ago and I  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4569) realized I realized oh my god oh my god  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4575) because I actually didn't know and I  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4578) realized that self amazement you could  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4580) be amazed with your abilities on your  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4582) own and it's still a spiritual disease  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4584) absolutely  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4585) for example I'm writing an essay I'm  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4588) like wow how do i articulate that point  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4591) now the problem here is this many times  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4597) I'm thinking well I'm not showing off so  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4599) there's no what you're show off to you  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4601) so it's not spiritual disease and the  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4604) reason it is is because you're actually  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4606) being industry intrinsic ability and  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4608) power and greatness to yourself where in  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4613) reality as the Quran says it was not you  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4617) that true it was all of that through  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4618) right it's because of Allah that you  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4621) even have the ability to articulate your  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4623) stuff it's because of Allah that you  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4625) have the ability to put words together  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4626) it is because of our mother you have an  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4629) akan intellect is because of Allah are  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4631) you able to put sentences together is  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4633) because one like you can express  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4634) yourself is because of all that you have  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4636) a mind it's all because of a lots of  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4638) panel water island you should be  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4640) grateful that you've been given that  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4641) ability which really is because of a lot  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4644) not you so if you're in a state of Arabs  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4647) self amazement you're in a state of  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4649) heedlessness because that was good  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4651) really you it was because of Allah and  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4654) you have done anything good it should  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4657) increase humility and it should increase  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4659) the fact of you appreciating a lot  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4661) majesty and greatness because this so  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4664) could goodness that you've done is only  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4666) a manifestation of the names and  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4668) attributes of a lot of  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4669) not you you scum and that's it  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4672) and I've seen you job throughout my life  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4675) even you know especially philosophers  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4678) right so when you studying post-grad  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4679) stuff philosophers have the greatest job  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4682) you like Wow I came up with an argument  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4685) hold on a second who is the source of  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4688) the occurred who's the source of  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4689) intellect leave the one who's Akeem alum  
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4692) the you has the totality of knowledge  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4694) and wisdom who has the picture we just  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4696) have the pic so all this stuff is only  
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4699) because Allah has allowed it and the  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4701) source of that is Allah and you are just  
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4703) the empty to that Allah has used in  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4705) order to manifest his main documents in  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4707) the real world  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4708) so because you know so so you teaching  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4715) me the single thing on a job I'm like  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4717) super Allah we I mean dad especially  
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4719) online and offline we suffer from self  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4723) amazement all the time and I think  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4727) therein lies the answer which you taught  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4729) me which is well you need to focus on  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4734) our loss subhana wa ta'ala and that is  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4736) the answer really because it wasn't  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4737) really used it's only because of Allah's  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4740) mercy he and because of his blessings in  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4744) your life and because of who he is that  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4746) you have been even being chosen to maybe  
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4750) express this idea or put this together  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4752) it's because of a lie should increase  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4755) humility and you should increase Koba  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4758) and it should increase gratitude if we  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4761) don't have those three things as a  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4763) result of doing something good then  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4764) we've messed up and that's very  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4766) interesting even endow organizations we  
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4768) pass cells on the back what does Allah  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4771) say in the chapter of the victory that  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4774) when Allah says you know when you see  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4776) the crowds of people coming to Islam  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4777) Allah says whoever you talk about go  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4783) back to Allah soprano what I don't cut  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4784) yourself on the back you know we have to  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4787) increase in humility in gratitude and  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4789) Toba if we have this sense of our job  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4791) and if anything good happens in our  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4793) lives we have to increase those things  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4795) and if we don't work we're heedless so  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4800) this is because  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4802) you brought which saves me my shoulder  
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4808) you've explained it so well and so  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4809) passionately in creation goodness so you  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4814) know then I I can just add one two  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4816) things around it then so if we just  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4818) remember that entropies from a Jabbar  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4819) Angelou means to be amazed is talking  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4821) about when someone is amazed with their  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4824) own selves or own abilities so it's a  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4827) type of conceit or self-conceited uncle  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4830) i'm self-conceited and that happens  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4832) precisely because of you said because  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4834) what you said  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4835) we've with we don't lift our gaze to  
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4838) allah but it said we focus our gaze on  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4842) ourselves so it's still house of i'm  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4844) still at the center allah should be at  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4846) the center but nine now at the center so  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4849) i'm impressed with my achievement my  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4852) accomplishments  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4853) i'm impressed with my dour or whatever  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4856) might my prayer and whatever but rather  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4861) as even a thought i'd lasted a day one  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4863) of the great spiritual masters of the  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4865) eighth this 19th century rejoice in  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4869) obedience not because it comes from you  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4872) but because it comes from allah to you  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4877) so it is okay to be happy with oneself  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4882) in terms of obedience but only when the  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4885) heart has been lifted up to God that  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4888) it's Allah who gave me as you said Ahmad  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4891) I meet either a mater when a keen man  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4893) wanna it wasn't you who through when you  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4896) through but it was God who through but  
[1:21:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4900) we struggle with this because we don't  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4905) live our gaze up enough to God Allah and  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4910) when we when there's and when there's  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4914) negligence in doing that Shaitaan just  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4917) whispers a little bit more and we then  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4919) convince ourselves that we are achieving  
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4923) it's Allah who helps us achieve so when  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4928) we talk about humility part of humility  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4930) in Islam is not not doing anything just  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4935) being helpless just like slavery in  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4938) Islam I'm an outdoor an ad the bowels  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4941) are slaves of God I mean we translated  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4943) as servants just to keep away from that  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4945) you know that slave trade idea but  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4948) otherwise if his slaves have gone  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4950) although what Allah teaches us that  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4952) we're his slaves but he doesn't want us  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4954) to be slavish life likewise Allah tells  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4958) us to be humble and to realize that no  
[1:22:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4963) one has any hole or who might or ability  
[1:22:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4966) except Allah Ya Allah  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4967) well a poet I didn't have enough so  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4970) therefore no one has any ability to  
[1:22:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4973) accomplish it's only Allah so one of the  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4976) root pillars of this of the spiritual  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4978) transition which if you like me you have  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4982) to keep reminding yourselves but yes  
[1:23:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4986) this is Allah Allah is to understand  
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4990) that there is no I have no ability and  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4994) that if I have done any good it's just  
[1:23:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=4996) divine gift what I do have that are my  
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5001) own are my sins but any good mattes are  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5007) becoming has anything from you know long  
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5009) whatever good comes to you comes from  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5010) Allah and we have to at least it might  
[1:23:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5015) start out with just I'm saying it with  
[1:23:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5017) my tongue it's not really there in my  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5019) heart but we need to press on it pressed  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5021) on it and just keep looking at the world  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5024) and my life and say and realizing that  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5027) is only Allah is only Allah at some  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5031) point each other we hope for divine  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5033) kindness but he would help lift our gaze  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5037) from ourselves which are really nothing  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5038) I mean what have I done  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5040) and we can focus it on Allah where  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5047) there's a will there's a way  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5048) there has to be the Iran of the  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5050) aspiration but that's not that's not a  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5054) spirituality that many of us will be  
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5056) comfortable about because it  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5057) spirituality that many of us will be  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5059) comfortable about even as Muslims where  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5062) I am at the center but spirituality and  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5065) sound is actually taking meal if how do  
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5067) I remove myself on the scent  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5070) and make my makeup about the center yeah  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5073) this is perfect because you know what  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5075) I'm gonna do will summarize an end  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5077) because the other two screws for disease  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5079) is kipper arrogance and hasit actually  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5084) one of the key diseases are permeating  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5087) the online space especially in the dour  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5089) so what I would like to do is to invite  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5091) you in the next couple of weeks to come  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5093) on and to reduce to meeting these things  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5095) because I wanted to because you know I  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5098) feel there is there is a sense of  
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5100) responsibility on my shoulders as well  
[1:25:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5101) to articulate to change the paradigm I  
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5104) don't I don't feel like look how many of  
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5109) the do art and michype online how many  
[1:25:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5111) of them have created leaders like true  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5115) leaders it's very rare to find because  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5118) true leadership in my view is the  
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5119) leadership of the process Salaam and he  
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5121) created true true leaders which were the  
[1:25:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5123) Sahaba the Sahaba create a beam and it  
[1:25:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5125) continued but these days an a this we in  
[1:25:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5128) the in this day and age what we're doing  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5129) we're creating followers to the point  
[1:25:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5133) where not he follows back my fans and  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5136) we're not creating people to go out like  
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5138) in the world to be beacons of light in a  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5140) productive way intellectually  
[1:25:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5141) spiritually and I remember a few years  
[1:25:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5144) ago in Chicago it was about six years  
[1:25:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5146) ago I think one brother may Allah bless  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5149) his name but mela mela blessed our  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5151) brother with paradise and the best in  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5154) this life in the Oscar he referred to me  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5156) he said to me  
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5157) Hamza what are you doing traveling the  
[1:25:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5159) world giving these lectures and speakers  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5161) who have you created what has he  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5163) actually done  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5165) I remember I came back and he was in  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5168) this very office i sat down with  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5169) Mohammed Arshad at that time he was the  
[1:26:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5171) operations manager and I started crying  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5176) actually like really broke down I was  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5178) like what what am i doing so I made a  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5180) commitment after that not I've always  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5182) been true to that commitment but I'm  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5183) trying to educate and empower to touch  
[1:26:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5186) moving in spy in order for them to  
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5188) become leader isn't to articulate a case  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5190) for Islam to become beacons of light so  
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5193) it you actually create those leaders and  
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5196) I think it's and that actually helped me  
[1:26:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5199) write the book actually helped change my  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5201) course until the Whale  
[1:26:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5203) developing in Islam because someone gave  
[1:26:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5205) me that reminder and and and and it did  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5209) and just because look and this is why I  
[1:26:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5212) want us to change the narrative I know  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5215) it's very hard but the paradigm on the  
[1:26:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5217) social media space in order for us to  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5219) move away from how many people are  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5221) liking me and following me and watching  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5223) me and subscribing to me but how many  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5225) people are truly touched moved and  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5227) inspired and that is a different metric  
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5230) you know because I always say like there  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5232) are some people they have nearly 300,000  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5234) photos on YouTube but when I've  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5236) interacted with some of the followers or  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5238) subscribers it's like these people  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5240) hasn't really really been touched moving  
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5242) inspired yes they may have an arc and  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5244) answered question but how do being  
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5247) touched moving inspired to the point  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5249) they elevate themselves to a degree that  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5251) they become a beacon of right now no and  
[1:27:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5253) that is a huge disservice to the  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5255) tradition and a huge service to the  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5258) process on a love Miley who are  
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5259) something because if we're going to be  
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5260) involved in its business we need to  
[1:27:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5262) elevate our standards and actually now  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5264) start creating these leaders and hasit  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5268) jealousy and arrogance is a barrier to  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5271) that and especially the social media  
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5273) especially at our field and inshaallah  
[1:27:55](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5275) invite you in the next couple of weeks  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5277) so we could zoom in on those topics and  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5279) unpack that more and i've made a lot of  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5281) statements SS up unpack that a little  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5283) bit more so let me just summarize  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5285) everything that we've just done so far  
[1:28:07](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5287) so basically we spoke about the heart  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5290) that the the the the the importance of  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5295) the spiritual honey Islamic tradition  
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5296) that you won't be safe from the day of  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5298) judgment this you have a sound heart  
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5299) that this is like morsel of flesh is  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5302) piece of flesh and the high if it's  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5303) sound the body is sound and we also have  
[1:28:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5307) to understand that Allah swears in the  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5309) Quran I think it's an 11 times the only  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5311) time I laughs where's 11 times only from  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5313) one topic  
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5314) it's the surah that you mentioned which  
[1:28:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5316) is the one who purifies the soul  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5318) succeeds it's the only time in the Quran  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5320) Allah swears 11 times around 11 times  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5322) just for one topic which is the  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5325) purification of the heart purification  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5326) of the soul so these are very important  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5328) matters and we need to learn learn to  
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5331) understand that you know our lack of  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5334) knowledge of things also  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5337) it makes a hot crusty because we could  
[1:28:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5339) be blinded - we could have blind spots  
[1:29:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5342) so we're thinking we're living a hell el  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5344) life a life that is pleasing to Allah  
[1:29:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5346) but because of lack of knowledge and  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5348) lack of insight we actually normalising  
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5351) Haram normalizing disobedience so we  
[1:29:14](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5354) have to be very careful about that  
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5355) you also mentioned about the four major  
[1:29:17](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5357) barriers to fulfilling the obligations  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5361) because fulfilling the obligations  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5362) primarily is the path to the love of  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5364) Allah subhanAllah  
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5366) and that is true spirituality being  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5368) submissive to Allah not just having nice  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5369) feelings and crying but actually you  
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5371) know that hadith that you mention on one  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5373) looks into your hearts and your actions  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5375) and there is a link between the two  
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5376) because the actions are derivative of  
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5378) our state of being I stay over hearts so  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5381) what is so what is a barrier a barrier  
[1:29:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5383) to that you mentioned  
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5384) it's how I is following your desires  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5386) your lowly desires it's Satan himself is  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5389) being in love with the lowly aspects of  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5392) the world dunya the loneliness lowly  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5394) ephemeral aspects of the world and it's  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5397) your whims and your ego so those things  
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5399) become like things we have to struggle  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5401) against in order for us to basically  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5404) follow the obligations and to be  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5406) submissive to Allah - did you have the  
[1:30:09](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5409) joyous love of Allah and the joyous hope  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5412) in his reward and then you said well we  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5416) need to also focus on the four in a  
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5418) spiritual disease which I'll link to the  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5420) full barrier of the obligations and  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5422) submissiveness which which we just  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5423) discussed these include a joke  
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5425) ostentation sorry our jobs are of  
[1:30:27](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5427) amazement reoxidation Kippur arrogance  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5430) and hazards jealousy we spoke about  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5433) ostentation which is doing acts of  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5435) worship for other than Allah  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5437) which is a major sin and we need to  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5439) basically have an ocular centric mindset  
[1:30:42](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5442) in order to remove this from ourselves  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5443) and to remember what water ana we also  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5446) talked about a job which is self  
[1:30:49](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5449) amazement and - you know unjust  
[1:30:51](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5451) understand that we're just empty tools  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5454) our Allah uses no to manifest his  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5456) majesty knees names and attributes and  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5457) fro our gaze to be focused on Allah  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5459) ought to be focused on ourselves as a  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5462) solution to ostentation and then we said  
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5464) we're gonna deal with jealousy and  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/r1eZEzM4rwM?t=5466) Kippur in the next couple of weeks in
