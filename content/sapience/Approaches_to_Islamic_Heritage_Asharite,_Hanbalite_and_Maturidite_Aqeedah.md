### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=3600)

 discusses the different approaches to Islamic belief among the three major sects of Islam: Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite Aqeedah. Asharite and Hanbalite aqeedah emphasize the attributes of God, while Maturidite Aqeedah stresses the attribute of mercy. El Juani, Abu Bakr al-Bakalani, and Amish Heather are all examples of early Islamic scholars who laid the groundwork for systematic theology.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=0)* Discusses Sunni Islam and the three main schools of thought: Maliki, Hanafi, and Hambali.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=300)* Discusses different schools of thought within Islam, namely asharite, hanbalite, and maturidite aqeedah. It explains that the ashari school of thought is the majority within the intelligentsia, and that metolidism and asharayakida are closely connected. The presenter goes on to say that if one understands these three different aqeedah schools, they have a road map for creedal developments within Islam.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=600)* Discusses the three main Islamic aqeedah (beliefs): Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite. Each school of thought had its own approach to theology and philosophy, with the Asharites being the most conservative. After Muhammad, there was a development in his works, with a shift from conservative to critical philosophy.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=900)**  Yanni discusses the different attitudes among Sunni Islamic scholars towards three classic texts of Sunni jurisprudence - the Tafsir of Ibn Kathir, the Mustadrak of al-Barbari, and al-Harawi's The Sensor of Kalam. He notes that while many early Salafis were accused of being Asharis, the accusation has lessened over time, and that there is now a more critical attitude among Sunni scholars towards such texts. He also mentions that while Bahari is not as important as some other Sulafis, he is still important.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=1200)** Hanbali, Maturidi and Ashari aqeedah are three different schools of thought within Sunni Islam. Hanbali and Maturidi aqeedah focus on the use of reason to determine the right Islamic doctrine, while Ashari aqeedah relies more heavily on Hadith. Sunnah, the practice of Muhammad, is the main source of authority for Hanbali and Maturidi aqeedah, while Ashari aqeedah also relies onCreed. Hanbali, Maturidi and Ashari aqeedah share similar doctrines, but Hanbali and Maturidi aqeedah emphasize different methods of reasoning. Hanbali relies heavily on analogical reasoning, while Maturidi relies more on scriptural reasoning. Khalil ibn Ishaq and Tamim ibn al-Muqaffaar are two of the most notable authors within Hanbali and Maturidi aqeedah, respectively.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=1500)** Imran Ashari wrote a number of books on Islamic theology, including one on the Hellfire. He argued that the Hellfire will eventually run out, and refused to refute a number of controversial positions.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=1800)* Discusses the various approaches to Islamic theology known as Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite Aqeedah. He notes that while some of Asharite's views on creed differ from those of other schools of thought, he is still highly respected within the Muslim community. He mentions a friend who is doing a thesis on how Asharite's views on divorce have made lives easier for Muslim women.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=2100)* Discusses the three main Islamic theological schools, Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite, and their respective beliefs regarding divorce. The Hambly school of thought, which is the most lenient in Islam when it comes to divorcing one's wife, is contrasted with the Hamilton and Divorcing schools of thought, which hold that divorce does not count if it is done during a period.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=2400)** The Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite aqeedah schools of thought have different opinions on the effect of the capital "H." The Asharite school believes that it has a major effect, while the Hanbalite and Maturidite schools believe it does not have a significant effect.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=2700)* Discusses three different aqeedah (religious beliefs) approaches: the Ashari, Hanbalite, and Maturidite. The Ashari position is that we don't know what the meaning of certain Quranic verses are, while the Hanbalite and Maturidite positions are that these verses are affirmations of specific attributes of Allah. The Ashari position has the same consequences as the Hanbalite and Maturidite positions, but the working results are different because the early Salaf had a tough position on the matter. Al-Qaeda is a principle which is consistent throughout the three aqeedah positions, but each one has counter examples.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=3000)* Discusses three Islamic aqeedah traditions - Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite - and how their teachings differ. He argues that the Creed of the early Muslims was very similar, but the articulations of the teachings were different. Later, Ashari lived in a martesley household and wrote Islamin, which is contested as an author.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=3300)* Discusses the different approaches to Islamic belief among the three major sects of Islam: Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite Aqeedah. Asharite and Hanbalite aqeedah emphasize the attributes of God, while Maturidite Aqeedah stresses the attribute of mercy. El Juani, Abu Bakr al-Bakalani, and Amish Heather are all examples of early Islamic scholars who laid the groundwork for systematic theology.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=3600) - [01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=5700)

 discusses the three main Sunni Muslim aqeedah schools of thought: the Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite. Each of these schools of thought has a different approach to the Quran, with the Asharite school believing in the earliest interpretation possible, the Hanbalite school believing in the opinion of the most renowned scholars, and the Maturidite school believing in the general consensus of the community.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=3600)* Discusses the four main schools of Islamic thought, Asharite, Hanbalite, Maturidite, and Deleting the works of Atasi (Arazi). All four schools have similarities, but Atasi is the only one who is willing to step outside the mainstream.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=3900)* Discusses the various schools of thought in Islamic theology. It discusses how one of the main ways that these schools of thought differ is in their approach to opponents: those who are deemed to be strong opponents are respected, while those who are considered weaker are not.  also mentions the late Mike Tyson, who is considered one of the best boxers of all time but who is not considered to be among the greatest Islamic scholars.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=4200)* Discusses the four major Islamic aqeedah schools: Asharite, Hanbalite, Maturidite, and Razi. These schools of thought emphasize different aspects of Islamic theology and jurisprudence.  also discusses the personality of Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was a major figure in the Razi school of thought.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=4500)* Discusses the various approaches to Islamic theology, with Ashari, Hanbalite, and Maturidite aqeedah being discussed. Ashari theology is seen as being more original and closer to the original sources of Islam, while the Hanbalite and Maturidite aqeedah approaches are seen as more developed and reflecting the changing needs and interests of later Islamic scholars. Ultimately, it is argued that all three approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and there is no one definitive approach to Islamic theology.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=4800)* Discusses the different aqeedah schools in Islam, focusing on the Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite. points out that while there are differences between these schools, they share a common heritage and belief in fatalism. He also mentions the important figure of Ibraham, who diverged from the other aqeedah schools in his view of the effects of human action.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=5100)* Discusses the different schools of thought within Islam, and how the Islamic attitude is one of tolerance and understanding. It discusses how certain actions taken by adherents to certain schools of thought could lead to Hellfire, and suggests that a Muslim must hold themselves accountable to their own health and well-being before worrying about others.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=5400)* Discusses three different aqeedah (religious beliefs) approaches to Islamic heritage: the Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite. The Mercy of God is mentioned in each, and the speaker argues that each has its own benefits and drawbacks. then discusses how to approach different people with different beliefs, and concludes that Islam is for everyone, regardless of age, sex, or orientation.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAW5mZ_0a4&t=5700)* Discusses the three main Sunni Muslim aqeedah (beliefs) and how they differ. The three schools of thought are the Asharite, Hanbalite, and Maturidite, and each believes in a different version of the Quran. The Asharite school believes that the Quran is immutable and should be interpreted according to the earliest interpretation possible, the Hanbalite school believes that the Quran should be interpreted according to the opinion of the most renowned scholars of the time, and the Maturidite school believes that the Quran should be interpreted according to the general consensus of the community.

[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=34) three-year program as many of you may  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=37) know  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=37) and last year what we covered in the  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=39) nine months that we were doing the work  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=40) was the londonia which was the main  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=44) refutational piece that sapiens  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=46) Institute had taken out or had put out  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=50) and then after that there was a kind of  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=51) like an appendix series to that which is  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=53) called the Shovelhead Series where in  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=55) which we discussed some of them some of  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=57) the main contentions uh that non-muslims  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=60) and others or ex-muslims or  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=62) um people who are anti-muslim would put  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=64) forward against Islam and this of course  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=67) is something you can still watch on the  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=69) sapiens Institute YouTube channel now if  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=71) you are aware also we have a platform

[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=82) stand in terms of um uh of your actual  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=86) grasp security of knowledge in these  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=89) areas then go ahead and go ahead and  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=92) take the test everyone here has taken  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=94) the test and passed passed with good  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=96) grades so the cohort will be with me  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=99) again obviously the same cohort that we  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=101) were with us in the last year including  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=104) Ali dawa himself who's uh thankfully  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=108) passed the test as well  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=112) [Laughter]  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=114) so that's that's these are the updates  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=117) if you like and before I get started  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=119) with today's kind of session which will  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=121) be more Interactive inshallah  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=123) what we wanted to say is as we're doing  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=126) this program there's an expectation for  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=129) us to also be doing Quran  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=131) to be sharpening up our Arabic skills to  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=133) be sharpening up Fick or Jewish prudence  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=136) and these things as well because the  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=137) soul wants to come out and do dawa then  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=139) this is the most important thing in fact  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=142) to memorize the Quran to understand it  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=143) to be able to read it  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=145) these are very important things okay so  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=147) I would suggest that we do that side by  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=150) side  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=152) in The Institute we've already got  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=153) programs in place for people in The Coho  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=155) cohort that um you know reading and  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=158) memorizing Quran and so on but that's  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=160) something that there's a lot of  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=162) provision for quite frankly  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=164) we've got critical content which if  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=166) someone cannot access for whatever  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=168) reason  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=170) um cannot access you know the  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=173) um a mosque or an institution which  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=175) deals with that you can go to critical  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=176) content which we have Quran all these  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=179) kinds of things you can do side by side  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=181) with this and the website for that is  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=183) critical content dot org now  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=187) move on  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=190) what we're going to be doing at  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=191) Insha'Allah we're looking at today is  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=193) we're going to be looking at some of the  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=196) main creedal developments now you will  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=198) know  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=199) that Sunni Islam you can look at it in  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=201) two different ways  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=203) one way is jurisprudentially from a law  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=205) perspective from a fix perspective  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=208) and we all know that there are four main  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=211) schools of thought now there weren't  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=213) only of four schools of thought there  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=215) were much more than four but these are  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=217) the surviving schools which have long  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=219) Traditions attached to them as you may  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=222) know this is the Maliki School let's  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=224) start with the hanifi school the Maliki  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=225) School the chef high school and the  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=227) Hambly School  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=229) after the names of the founders of these  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=232) particular schools of thought  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=234) and there's limited controversy relating  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=236) to this in other words if someone says  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=238) I'm sure or I am merely key or I am  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=241) hamberly or I am hanafi this doesn't  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=244) generate a kind of con controversiality  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=247) I mean these are well known within the  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=250) tradition to be four different distinct  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=253) schools of thought which bring about the  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=256) same kind of objective  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=258) and so in many ways you won't find  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=260) anything controversial you know anything  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=263) worthy of major mention between these  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=266) four schools of thought which will  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=268) divide communities say  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=270) and so the focus of this topic is not  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=273) about the the schools of thought today  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=277) we're going to be looking at the creedal  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=278) schools of thought  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=279) and we're going to be looking  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=280) particularly at three main schools of  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=283) thought  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=284) one of them is humbleism otherwise known  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=286) as authorism sometimes referred to as  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=290) sometimes also referred to as the  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=291) salafiakida  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=293) now salafism  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=297) is different to groups who refer to them  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=299) thus themselves in that way  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=302) so we are not talking about this group  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=305) or that group who refer to themselves in  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=307) these titles that may reside in a  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=309) subcontinent or the UK or the us we were  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=311) talking about the original  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=313) which is referred to as hamburger so  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=317) we're going to be taking a look at that  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=318) the books its proponents its Founders  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=321) and these kinds of things  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=323) we'll also be looking at  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=325) asharism which in many ways in many of  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=329) the institutions could be considered to  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=331) be the majority in terms of the  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=333) Intelligentsia for example the deoband  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=336) institution is ashari uh for example  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=339) Azhar in Egypt is ashari inclined or  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=343) majority I could say uh you know and so  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=347) on in if you go to North Africa most of  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=350) the institutions of calorie is ashari  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=352) and so on uh even Mauritania you'll find  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=355) that the scholars there are ashari so  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=358) it's important for us to know what is  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=359) this ashari where does it come from  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=360) how's it differentiated from humbleism  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=365) um you know these kinds of things and  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=367) the third thing is we're going to be  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=369) looking at metolidism which is very very  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=371) closely connected to ashathism however  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=374) there are some differences between metal  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=376) aqueda and asharayakida which we'll be  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=378) looking at in some some  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=381) generalities I'm not going to say in  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=383) some detail but if one knows if one is  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=386) familiar has some level of grasp  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=389) between these three different kinds of  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=391) creed then one has a road map for the  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=395) creedal developments or the creedal  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=397) differences between the major schools of  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=399) thought in Islam and before I continue I  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=402) should also say that  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=403) uh it shouldn't not be imagined  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=405) demographically that throughout the  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=407) Muslim world that people if you ask them  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=409) are you ashari or are you meridi or are  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=411) you humble yourself or whatever they'll  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=413) say they'll give you an answer to this  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=414) question  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=415) because the truth is  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=417) as was once stated by a great scholar  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=421) the Layman has no meth up  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=424) the Layman has no matter if you go to  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=426) London or anywhere where there's a  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=428) Muslim Community and you ask 10 people  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=430) what which one do you follow what is the  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=432) difference between more salafism he I  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=435) promise you they will not know  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=438) they will not know  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=440) the majority of people do not know that  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=442) there's no evidence to show that the  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=443) majority of people know that stuff  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=445) because a lot of this stuff is actually  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=446) quite complicated not all of it is but a  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=448) lot of it's quite complicated and it  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=451) should not be assumed and this is very  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=452) important in the outset it should not be  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=454) assumed that if you don't know this very  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=456) specific  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=457) detail or Masala an issue of creed that  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=460) you're going to go to the Hellfire  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=462) although it's something that's going to  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=463) happen to you that you're not on the  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=465) right path or whatever  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=466) these are  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=468) uh bullying tactics that are done by  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=470) people of all different types of creedal  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=472) school of thought or if you don't  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=474) believe in this and that  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=475) and they they position this especially  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=477) to lay audiences these are bullying  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=479) tactics  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=480) and they have no hustle in the religion  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=482) they have no Foundation the religion  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=484) because these a lot of these  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=485) conversations that were had in The  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=487) Classical period in the medieval period  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=489) were in fact conversations which were  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=492) for the academics and intelligence  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=494) even Tamia was once asked why'd you go  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=497) into detail about these issues and he  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=499) goes Allah I only go into details on  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=501) these issues  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=502) because people ask me about them but I  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=505) did not intend that for the late  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=506) audience  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=508) he said I did not intend these details  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=510) of akhida for the late audience  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=512) when the prophet Muhammad was asked what  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=515) is Iman what is the what is Faith he  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=518) said  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=523) he mentioned six pillars of Iman six he  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=526) didn't go into details and you have to  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=527) believe in this and that and all of that  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=528) and you know this and this scholar said  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=530) that and you have to know that he didn't  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=531) go into this  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=533) and then he was asked again  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=536) what is uh Hassan he said and and  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=541) that you worship Allah as if you can see  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=543) him because if you can't see him he can  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=545) see you very basic anybody a farmer can  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=548) understand that a car mechanic can  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=549) understand it somebody who's working  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=551) fishmonger can understand it  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=554) that's it there's no the religion of  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=557) Islam is not complicated like that  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=560) it really isn't the basis the or the  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=564) basics of the religion of Islam are very  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=566) easy for anybody to understand having  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=570) said that of course there have been some  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=572) controversy controversies within Islam  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=574) throughout the 1200 300 years of its  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=578) development and we should be privy to  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=580) that and understand it because this uh  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=582) for us for our purposes is important  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=586) so we should start with saying the  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=589) following we should start by saying that  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=592) if you look at the early and I will be  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=594) making some claims here which maybe some  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=596) people will not find comfortable or  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=598) whatever but I think everything can be  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=599) substantiated  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=602) unfortunately for those who may claim to  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=604) the contrary there was no such thing as  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=606) Mercedes in the first 200 years because  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=610) he didn't exist you know and neither  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=615) Didi those individuals existed in the  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=618) 4th Century ah before that  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=622) there were you can say Proto  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=626) pseudo  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=628) um Kalam type  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=629) efforts made with smlc fat and so on  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=632) with names and attributes of God but it  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=634) wasn't the fully fledged ashari medhab  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=636) or the fully fledged metal what you find  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=638) in the first couple of hundred years  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=640) is a clear kind of scripturalism  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=642) you you find this very very clearly  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=645) scripturalism meaning that people would  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=647) not go into a long discursive discussion  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=650) unspeculative theology that they would  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=653) mention if they were asked questions  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=654) they would mention very brief answers in  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=658) fact if you look at the  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=660) um the main works like for example  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=664) this is one of the books actually  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=666) authored the bukhari who is the same  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=669) we read his and so on he also this book  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=674) and in it he wanted to exonerate himself  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=676) from the charge that he believes that  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=677) the Quran was created and so he put just  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=679) he lists  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=681) a quail of the all the sayings  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=684) of uh salaf of of the Companions and the  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=687) the tabain and so on  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=690) mentioning their position on the matter  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=692) meaning he he relegated the matter to  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=695) people who he thought he was more senior  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=696) than himself This Is How They dealt with  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=698) their situation  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=699) likewise with the situation of where is  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=701) God which has become a very  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=702) controversial matter he had a very clear  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=704) position which is that he believed God  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=706) was above the throne which is the  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=707) scriptural position which is the  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=708) authority position which is the habit  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=709) and you will not find many people  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=712) speaking in the coded syntax of the  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=715) asharis in the early days I mean it's  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=717) almost impossible to find  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=718) but this is a reality and it's a  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=720) historical reality unless someone wants  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=721) to fabricate or superimpose history on  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=724) onto the first 200 years of Islam which  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=727) which would be false  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=731) and so if you wanted to look at um some  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=735) books from the first two three hundred  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=737) years of Islam maybe even 400 years  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=740) of the humble yakida  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=745) actually I'm not going to mention of the  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=748) hamburger but generally we're talking  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=750) about uh Sunnah of  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=753) Imam Ahmed now if you look at there was  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=756) a development in his works  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=758) there was a clear development in his  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=760) Works in first when he was talking about  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=762) when he was when he wrote which by the  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=765) way I have to be honest and say there is  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=766) a contestation on its attribution to him  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=770) there is some level of contestation of  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=772) his attribution to him  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=776) this particular book  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=779) there is some contestation on uh is  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=781) attributed to um  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=784) is actually not there's not much  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=786) controversy there but if you look at the  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=788) transition between Sunnah versus  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=794) that particular transition you can see  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=797) that he was very conservative in the  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=799) beginning of dealing with matters  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=800) related to speculative Theology and then  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=804) that moved forward into a more  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=808) critical non-scripturalist attitude and  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=810) in fact I did manage to find and I've  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=813) sent it to you guys in the group I'm not  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=814) sure if you guys have it maybe we'll put  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=816) it up on the thing but I did manage to  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=819) find the quote of his where he he  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=821) actually gives the reasoning for that so  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=823) I remember ahm has given the reason for  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=824) that and he says that the reason why I  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=826) we when we were compelled when we were  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=829) asked to  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=832) to get involved in that kind of  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=834) discussion we did  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=836) when we were when we had to do it we did  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=838) it so in other words there was more of a  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=840) conservative attitude in the beginning  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=841) from Ahmad  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=842) and then he said you know when we were  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=844) pushed to do it because we don't want to  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=846) get involved in this kind of thing  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=847) but when we were pushed to do it we got  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=849) involved in it  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=850) which refutes the idea  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=853) that the early salaf they didn't engage  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=855) in critical thinking outside of a  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=857) scriptural basis it completely nullifies  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=859) the idea and you'll see if you read  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=861) al-jami you'll see making logical  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=865) arguments uh non-scriptural in in  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=866) content  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=869) so even within uh you know an academy  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=874) who came after Muhammad really opened  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=877) the floodgates for this especially his  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=878) responses to the martasillas and stuff  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=880) that he was he was engaging now with  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=882) almost completely with it with these  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=883) kind of things and obviously at the time  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=885) of the britainia we find  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=887) full full-on full-fledged philosophy  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=889) works of philosophy being produced  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=892) I mean if you if you were to say what is  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=893) a specialist in I would actually say  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=895) he's a specialist in Kalam he's a  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=898) specialist in kalaman fatwa these are  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=899) his two main areas of specialism You  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=901) could argue everything else but these  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=902) are two main areas especially so every  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=904) time we are engaged in philosophy and  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=906) there's only a fool would would say he  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=908) didn't and in fact he quite clearly  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=911) as stated his position about that and  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=913) we've made videos and all that kind of  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=915) thing and quoted him at length Yanni on  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=917) these points which doesn't we don't need  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=918) to talk about that  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=921) but you'll see that there's different  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=922) attitudes within the hambley school  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=924) especially if we for example look at the  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=926) works of abuela and his because his  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=930) student  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=931) okay  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=933) were accused of being asharis at one  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=936) point  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=937) because of how you know  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=940) philosophical being and so on and so  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=942) that show that in the early days there  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=944) was some tension going on here people  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=946) were suspicious suspicious  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=948) about the use of and their positions of  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=951) tafoid and so on and but the point is  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=954) others like al-harawi he wrote a book  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=956) called the sensor of Kalam then  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=959) you will find this  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=961) you know al-bar Bahari is very hardcore  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=964) and scripturalist in in his his Works  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=968) many was very very  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=971) you know he affirmed you know he  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=974) affirmed you know the attributes in a  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=975) very  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=977) in fact even affirmed attributes which  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=980) are not mentioned and he was refuted for  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=982) that like for example he said haraka  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=984) that God moves but there's no  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=987) anyway the point is  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=990) you'll find in the Corpus of humbly  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=992) scholarship a development towards or  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=994) movement towards a more critical  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=996) attitude  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=997) towards these kinds of things  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1000) any questions so far before we move on  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1002) statements  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1017) yes so you'll find if you're speaking to  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1019) salafi people that they'll mention these  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1021) books of salaf a lot of the time  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1025) you know these individuals it's very  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1028) important to realize that although even  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1030) bhatta is very important to us okay and  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1032) so is  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1033) they're not turbine and they're not Yani  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1035) they are not Ahuja without respect to  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1038) them  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1039) in fact like for example and even Bata  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1043) those two individuals who keep being  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1046) mentioned because I mean they say things  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1048) about uh for example Hakim and stuff  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1051) like that you know mana and not allowed  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1053) to do these kind of things which are  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1055) useful to certain agendas and certain  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1058) people  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1060) um there were contemporaries with which  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1063) we were just talking about before the  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1064) taping of this thing  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1066) yeah so IBN has him was a free thinker  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1068) but much more so than even  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1070) in many other ways yeah and that's not  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1072) to be taken only positively because  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1074) we're very negative like sometimes a  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1075) open-minded it can be like an open wound  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1077) sometimes  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1079) I'm not saying it's positive thing but  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1081) he's completely different  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1082) has him versus  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1086) you know but they were kind of like  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1087) we're in the same generation we're  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1089) talking about so to mentioned that  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1094) you know and so on so okay we say fine  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1097) but when did  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1099) their words become meaning is it when  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1102) did it become equivalent  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1104) to what Allah said of the messenger said  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1106) no one equated that even what the sahaba  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1109) said  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1110) in fact  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1111) in fact  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1114) or the saying of the sahabi is  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1119) from the sharai things which there's a  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1122) difference for opinion whether you take  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1123) it or not in other words if IBN said  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1125) something big sahabi come said something  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1132) telling you something  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1134) there's a difference of opinion whether  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1135) we should take it and we should  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1137) establish a ruling with the owner so if  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1139) that is the case with one sahabi imagine  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1141) how you bring me even like okay  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1144) I'm sorry to say yes I'm not saying  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1146) they're nullified or they're very not  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1147) important but Bahari is not important is  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1149) not important but that's not important  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1151) but since when did they become a hot  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1152) gender religion of Islam  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1155) so if people are using them as evidence  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1157) as if it's equivalent to the Quran look  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1160) what they said about look what they said  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1162) about this matter look what they said  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1163) about that matter we say it's little  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1164) evidence  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1165) if I rejected everything in bhatta said  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1168) that was yeah I mean there was no age  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1169) Mound anything that his of his own juice  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1173) potential preference I've done no sin  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1179) and moreover you'll find that people use  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1183) the  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1186) German the issue of they will use  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1190) the  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1191) um  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1192) how would you translate how would you  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1194) translate  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1195) jar has maybe the screw yeah maybe yeah  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1200) scrutinizing negatively scrutinizing uh  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1203) people yeah but then to write them off  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1206) in a sense  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1208) to give them jarah yeah  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1211) they'll use that as a as an Evidence to  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1213) do tabdia some of them will do that  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1215) they'll say Okay therefore we can do  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1216) which is to  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1218) to create to make someone or declare  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1220) someone as a deviant someone is  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1224) they'll do this and they say look this  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1226) person has made the obvious person that  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1228) person made up the other that person  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1229) in the early setup but some people  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1231) hanifa  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1234) um  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1238) no one was not spoken about the issue of  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1242) almost no one at that time was not so  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1244) only a few  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1245) the issue of  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1247) uh let's use the the attitude of people  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1250) in the early days when they were just  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1252) writing down Hadith  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1254) they were writing down Hadith they knew  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1256) that their writing down of the Hadith  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1257) would constitute the foundation for all  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1259) other generations to try and use their  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1261) methods their historically scrutinizing  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1264) methods on the lay population this is  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1266) something outrageous  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1269) you know in Saudi Arabia too many of  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1272) them seem to see us like a pope figure  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1274) that he said this is uh something which  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1276) is not it's not acceptable  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1278) to be completely fair to him  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1280) so the point I'm making is one one sees  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1283) one looks at the salaf  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1285) one must be the conclude three things  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1288) quite strongly number one they didn't  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1290) have this especially on issues with  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1291) mouse effect they did not have this uh  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1294) very um  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1297) elaborative  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1300) phraseological what is the Kalam of God  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1303) what is the Kalam of God didn't say it's  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1305) not distance negative negative like what  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1306) you'd find in ashari books and that is a  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1309) provocative statement but it's just not  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1311) there  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1312) it it might be provocative for some  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1314) people it's just not there I mean you  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1316) will not find buhari speaking like that  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1317) and you will not find them Ahmad  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1319) speaking like that you will not but at  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1321) the same time so that's one thing but at  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1323) the same time this other myth which is  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1324) that they didn't engage in uh extra  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1327) scriptural polemics is also false  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1330) movie even even in the first book that  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1333) he wrote which is Sunnah he he even  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1336) talked about something called ola  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1338) she's a type of analogical reasoning  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1341) it's a type of reasoning which is not  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1344) necessarily scriptural and basis but  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1345) then he expanded that in his later works  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1347) and he and he mentions that and  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1349) Khalil is one of the main people who  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1351) actually one of his main students and  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1353) codify his works  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1354) one of the main people is Khalil  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1357) and the other person is  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1360) so yeah he moved he changed and then we  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1363) completely opened the door  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1365) and so that's the second mistake we can  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1368) bust the third one is  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1370) this idea of taking Tab Diya from the  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1372) early generation  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1374) but their situation number one was  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1376) completely different  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1378) number two some of the tab Dias we  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1379) reject anyway  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1380) like for example  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1385) for example of buhari and great Scholars  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1389) Nativity of these people I'm not even  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1390) going to mention who they are because I  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1391) don't want to  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1392) create controversy online okay  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1395) but if we can reject those great  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1396) Scholars  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1399) who who doesn't who would not be an  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1401) atom's weight of you know knowledge  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1403) compared to any of these great salaf  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1406) which is on the mission I'm sure  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1408) so no that's the truth if we can reject  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1411) the tab Dr of the great Scholars of  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1413) salaf  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1415) even even albani  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1418) foreign  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1438) because then they'll disqualify everyone  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1441) else from being a scholar and so it  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1443) becomes my dad is bigger than your dad  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1447) anyway moving on  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1449) from the south we do find a lot of these  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1451) things  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1455) but then we find  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1459) The Works of ibentamia  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1463) and he CR I've personally believe he  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1465) created a paradigm shift  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1467) even Tamia created a paradigm shift in  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1469) asari  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1470) um  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1472) you know creedal development  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1475) because you just opened parent doors box  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1479) kind of worms in fact no sorry not one  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1481) kind of woman see he had a table full of  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1483) worms kind of worms and he opened all of  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1485) them  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1486) he got he engaged in super rational  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1489) polemics that no one from the humbly  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1492) mother before him ever did in the way  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1494) that he did it  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1496) nobody did like him whether you agree  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1498) with him or not on his issues or his  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1500) stances that's what he done  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1503) and even take me I wrote many books  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1505) voluminous compendious works  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1508) is shockingly it's terrifyingly  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1510) voluminous  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1513) for example  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1519) these are if they were on this they  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1522) would take they would occupy two two  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1524) full uh shelves  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1527) and he wrote a lot of this when he was  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1528) in prison  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1529) you know the man was a wondrous man  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1532) was it was a phenomenal man  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1535) a very powerful individual and he argued  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1538) and he engaged with the literature  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1541) he genuinely engaged with the literature  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1543) which is why he wrote a shot actually  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1545) called which we went through a lot of it  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1547) in this class or in our other classes  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1551) you know it's about 260 pages  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1554) but he basically goes through the  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1556) textbook of Isfahan  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1559) who wrote that's very small I mean if  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1562) you look at that is funny that he was  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1564) doing um is like this big it's very  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1566) small but he was going he's going  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1568) through each part of it God's existence  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1570) the Oneness of God  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1572) the Revelation the homage is at  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1574) uh and and so on this was basically the  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1577) structure the goal wrap structure he  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1579) actually went through it which is why we  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1582) are translating this work actually  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1584) because it's in line with our objectives  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1587) is being translated as we speak Yani by  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1592) the sapiens Institute  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1594) because it's an important work  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1596) so that's one thing  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1599) he engaged  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1602) people don't even realize that he he  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1604) actually commented on scientific matters  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1605) even though he was no expert on this  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1607) matter  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1608) but okay wrote a book on Alchemy and  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1611) chemistry and so on and refuting the  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1613) point the refuting Alchemy  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1616) so he was a polymath of you know a  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1618) tremendous man  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1620) obviously you have much Mortal fatal  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1621) which once again this was one of his  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1624) great genres that he was engaged in if  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1627) you saw if it was on one of these  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1629) shelves it would take maybe one and a  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1630) half of the Shelf  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1631) so imagine how much this man wrote and  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1633) then you obviously have these small  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1634) textbooks that people read  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1636) which is  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1639) and so on so he wrote A lot of these  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1642) books  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1642) and so if someone wants to know the  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1645) person for the most part if someone  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1646) wants to know the position of Atari  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1648) Islam or the asterisk they'll look at  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1650) him yeah  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1651) there's only a few opinions which I  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1653) don't want to open the once again  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1655) another kind of worms and say that the  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1657) majority of others don't agree with that  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1659) even Tamia believed in  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1661) a few creedal positions and in fact I  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1664) might open the kind of one since we are  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1665) here in sapiens Institute and this is  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1667) why why not which is fine or not  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1670) the idea that he believed that the  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1672) Hellfire will run out  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1675) and people say well he didn't actually  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1676) believe that he changed his mind and  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1677) whatever but it's very clear that Imran  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1680) believed that he believed that believe  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1681) that and whatever says is usually his  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1684) final opinion how do we know that if you  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1686) look at chef  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1688) of the book which of the claim wrote he  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1691) he dedicates an entire chapter on  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1692) arguing the case  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1694) for final or not and in fact you know  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1696) who tries to refute him  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1698) he refuses he says all of the Assad he  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1700) brings is a week and so on it's very  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1703) interesting but the point is find out  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1704) not exactly the issue no one's making  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1707) because you know what the stakes are how  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1709) you make the deal of him when he's the  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1710) one who you know brought the  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1712) sledgehammer on all of the opponents  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1713) which you can never bring  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1716) because it's one of the pillars of Iman  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1718) which is you know which is the Hellfire  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1723) you see you don't always make a temp  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1724) there are no one when the salary  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1725) movement  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1727) I know of I'd love to see someone from  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1729) the any of the sects of salafism Stripes  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1732) different Stripes say well because of  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1733) this he's going to come off  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1735) sometimes when somebody Escala does such  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1738) a great work  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1739) he actually gets immunity from certain  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1741) things  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1747) okay now someone's not saying he's not a  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1749) shouting here okay fine that means I can  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1751) say believe that and Azul is the angels  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1753) and then he's not Ashland you're making  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1756) you're making hasharism you're making a  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1758) salafism even include these positions  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1759) and you can believe in this difference  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1761) opinion is it then no it's not he wasn't  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1763) ashari he or at least he put at least at  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1768) least  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1768) he he possessed some major archery  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1771) positions  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1773) it's the minimum we wanted to say about  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1774) but because he he's done fatal Berry  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1777) great work people say no just leave him  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1781) well then what we're going to do when we  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1782) need to do  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1784) I know we same thing we're gonna do now  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1787) these two we don't want to touch them  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1789) we're not going to go to the other uh to  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1791) the Hadith we're not going to get rid of  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1793) this how do you say this one  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1795) so once again the point is is um  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1801) okay  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1804) yeah  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1807) even take me out completely  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1810) shifted the paradigm another work which  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1813) we we also looked at in our spare time  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1816) was suffered I suffer there very  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1818) interesting and long work  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1822) I mean the interesting thing is he's  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1823) actually a comparative religionist he  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1825) got involved and that's why he wrote a  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1827) job  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1829) which was a refutation of Christianity  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1832) foreign  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1834) pretty much mimicked him in many of the  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1835) things that he did like if you want to  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1837) know what Infamous positions are on  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1839) Creed then 99.9 of the time is going to  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1842) be able to climb his positions as well  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1847) not all of them take me as students are  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1849) like that  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1851) so some of his students like for example  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1852) he was critical of him Elizabeth  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1856) he was yes he was in asari but he wasn't  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1859) engaged in that same kind of polemics  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1860) that yeah Evan Tammy was engaged in  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1864) he was even accused of being a Shiite  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1866) but he wasn't a Shiite to be fair to him  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1869) but he was completely he was a bit  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1871) lacking him that hasn't in the sense  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1872) that if you look at uh Bulbul  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1877) would you call it a Tuffy writes  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1882) the guy's clever the guy is actually a  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1884) genius  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1886) but he and he doesn't care what even  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1887) Timmy has to say  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1889) and some of them don't care like from a  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1890) 50 perspective most of the school they  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1892) respect him  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1894) you know he's very special Islam they  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1897) call him  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1898) in abbreviation  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1901) however some of them just hand wave his  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1903) opinions whatever  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1907) it's literally  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1909) yeah yeah whatever you know and we don't  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1912) for example in the case of third three  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1913) divorcements the case of three  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1915) divorcements No One Believes In that  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1917) exception he said okay  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1920) his granddad uh he done  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1924) he told him in a secret modulus that you  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1927) know three is one  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1929) but basically the entire school go and  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1931) look from from the times of the mother  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1933) all the way to elmerdale and so on  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1935) you're not going to find anyone who says  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1937) this but this is a matter three divorces  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1939) in one which is very controversial  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1941) and in fact yeah if you follow Montana  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1944) you're not doing a sin  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1946) it's a major major matter imagine a  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1948) woman some guy you know  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1950) especially this apparently it's a big  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1951) thing in the ending the subcontinent  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1952) subcontinent and whatever and he says  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1954) you're divorced a million times  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1956) I don't know why he had to say this but  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1958) he means it and he says you're the horse  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1960) a million times all the madhubs the  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1962) martaba opinion is that she's actually  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1963) divorced three times and she has to go  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1965) and marry another man and sleep with the  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1967) other man  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1968) yeah I mean and that's why they've  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1969) created this Halala programs and  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1971) whatever which is Haram and obviously  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1972) the prophet has a thing but I've been  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1974) telling me I use even even our best  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1977) and so on and he uses arguments from  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1979) himself and he actually makes a  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1980) compelling argument like I'm not saying  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1982) I agree on not anyone to agree or  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1984) disagree but I'm just saying he had that  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1985) opinion  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1986) and now if people follow his opinion  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1988) which is that three in one or a million  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1990) and one is actually just one  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1993) then they're not they can live like that  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1995) that's not they're following a mustache  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=1998) so in terms of the sociological  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2000) landscape  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2001) you could I I think I had a friend of  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2004) mine who was doing a thesis on how he's  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2005) made lives of women easier  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2008) basically because that is a factor that  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2010) you can imagine right  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2012) will change the game in terms of  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2015) the Muslim Community  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2017) and I even had a Visa going to salafis  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2020) for this fatwa  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2023) you know that's what I hear  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2025) but but it's it's a in terms of he  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2029) wasn't although he had different  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2031) opinions and stuff like that from the  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2032) rest of the method he wasn't as as  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2034) influential as he was in in Creed in his  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2036) own School in his own school he was he  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2038) was the major  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2039) like for example if not saying me of our  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2041) times like in the last 50 34 years yeah  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2044) if you want to know what even Tamia's  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2046) opinion is on a critical matter just  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2047) look what nothing means that for most  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2049) cases 99.9 or 99.1 let's say there's a  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2053) few matters which are not the case he  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2055) goes directly to Batavia and he finds  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2057) the matter there  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2058) so it's like copy and paste  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2060) sorry to say  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2061) and that's no disrespect to if nothing I  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2064) like I love nothing but I think he's a  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2066) very you know great scholar  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2068) but if you want to know what even Tamia  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2070) believes look at nothing  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2071) there's no Yani  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2074) he's not doing any gymnastics also he's  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2076) just looking at what time you said and  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2077) he agrees with it  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2078) he trusts him  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2080) so he's he's  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2082) been taking me as um  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2085) ebuntamia's uh his influence is so  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2087) widespread and that's why now they're  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2088) starting to look into him in the western  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2090) Academy like John Hoover and stuff like  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2091) that they're starting to look into him  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2092) and write books about him and stuff  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2094) he's a he's a big name and in fact  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2097) he talks about things which no one else  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2098) talked about  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2101) these things which we've discussed in  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2103) the class before but like no Salah spoke  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2106) about it no Sarah spoke about it it's  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2108) his position and and the thing is like  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2110) for example nominalism  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2112) that is a pure philosophical opinion  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2115) normalism the idea that the particulars  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2117) are the only things that they are and  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2119) they're all conceptualism pull it  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2120) conceptualism is he argues for  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2122) conceptions I mean he argues against  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2123) certain things on the base of  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2125) conceptualism  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2126) but that's a pure philosophical opinion  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2128) now unless you know that this is  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2130) getting this from his uncle  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2133) he even taped me up he's getting this  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2135) from his brain  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2137) yes then then you won't be able to  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2140) distinguish what even take me is getting  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2142) from his alcohol and as a human being  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2143) his act and what he's getting from the  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2145) nurse some people just confuse the two  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2146) and say whatever but he's just because  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2148) he was a scripturalist at heart doesn't  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2150) mean he was a scripture this in  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2151) everything he did he certainly wasn't  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2153) and so  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2155) he made rational logical arguments  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2164) now any questions before we go to the  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2166) school of thought  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2174) divorcing  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2180) that free if you saved in free it counts  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2183) as one or is it okay one oh he believed  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2185) that yeah isn't it better Innovation  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2188) that um if you do that yeah  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2190) so he was against that everyone's  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2192) against doing it but the question so so  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2195) the rest of the method say that if a  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2197) person does it it's better but it still  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2198) counts  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2200) just like for example like he also had  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2203) an opinion about um divorcing your wife  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2205) in the in the period  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2206) yeah isn't that he says it doesn't count  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2208) the divorce doesn't count oh yeah even  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2211) take me it says that if you divorce her  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2212) and even if you meant it it doesn't  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2214) count if you're in a period but the rest  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2215) of the Hamburg school doesn't believe  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2216) that  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2217) it's never Hadith about that that if you  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2219) divorce your wife in um  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2221) I have to look into that there's  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2223) probably lots of Hadith on this yeah but  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2225) it's not it's not allowed but once again  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2227) does it count or not count that's the  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2229) question but it basically even take me a  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2232) school of thought in terms of divorce is  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2233) the most lenient in Islam  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2235) yeah interesting The Humble is what if  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2238) you if one wanted to play the game okay  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2241) if you want to get the most lenient  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2242) opinions and this is not by the way I  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2244) don't think this is wrong  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2246) actually this might sound conversion but  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2247) if someone wanted to be a Hambly  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2249) in bed  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2253) one could do so  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2256) and then but I'm not saying that one  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2257) should do so but the Hamilton school of  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2260) thought there's no contradiction here  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2261) because so long as it's in the same  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2264) bab it's not a big issue  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2266) uh however I'm saying that you know even  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2269) tell me I believed  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2271) three in one he didn't sorry it's not  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2273) it's just one he believed that um  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2277) if you divorce your wife from his period  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2279) it doesn't count  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2281) and the hamburgers believe that hola is  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2283) different from talaq  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2285) so if you give your wife a thousand hola  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2287) oh yeah that that doesn't count as one  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2289) of the three it's a good it's a good  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2291) solution for this marital issue really  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2293) if you think about it because it is if  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2295) you think about because it'd be like if  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2296) you follow the opinion you know when you  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2298) get into this argument it's usually I  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2299) tell Brothers the tunnock belongs to you  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2301) yeah if she wants to go get a holder  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2303) let's do it you went okay go get it hold  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2305) on no problem get 500 times million  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2307) times  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2309) she has to ask for it  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2312) yeah no problem yeah that's just to give  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2314) something back as well like that's how  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2315) it's uh that's fine whatever it is at  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2317) the end of the day the fact that you  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2318) don't destroy the maritime yeah yeah I  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2320) mean it leaves the door open doesn't it  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2321) exactly yeah exactly yeah she's gonna  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2323) come back anyways I mean all the others  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2326) by the way yeah exactly but from what I  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2328) remember which mother says that  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2330) all of them except for the Hamilton  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2334) all of them except humbling yeah  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2336) oh so if you guys call it cancel that  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2338) except for the Hamilton I wonder where  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2341) okay interesting humbly must have the  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2342) only one that doesn't say  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2344) foreign  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2349) okay so um  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2350) all right let's have a break let's have  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2352) a break for prayers and stuff yeah and  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2354) then we'll uh go to the ashram and how  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2357) it started and stuff like that and  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2358) obviously I want interaction as well  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2361) a little bit but we want to get a  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2363) roadmap first yeah well we want to get a  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2365) road map of what's going on because  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2366) right now just to summarize maybe we  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2368) should just just to summarize what we've  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2369) done is we've looked at the first kind  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2370) of 200 years yeah  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2372) like if you look there is a book in in  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2375) Black in Arabic it's called like Gemma  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2376) yeah which has all these Aquarius inside  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2379) of it but basically if you look at the  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2381) first 200 years what we have seen is  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2384) that the matter is quite scripturally  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2386) conservative there's not much  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2388) speculative theology going on there's  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2390) not much calango there's not much  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2391) philosophizing going on the the extent  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2393) to which such philosophizing speculative  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2396) theology is actually a part of the  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2397) discourse is the extent to which  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2399) people within that school of thought  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2401) think it's necessary  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2403) so when the matazi school or  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2405) proto-maticism becomes protomaticism  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2410) and those figures when they appear and  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2413) they have a very  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2415) they have a very staunch negative  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2418) attribute in negating the attributes  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2421) position so they'll say like you know  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2423) these attributes are they don't believe  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2425) in any of these attributes have actual  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2426) meaning so then there's a there is a  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2428) strong reaction to that  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2431) and so that's why you'll not find in the  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2432) in the first kind of 200 300 years much  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2435) people saying you know speaking in uh  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2437) philosophical terms when describing  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2438) issues to do with Allah's names and  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2441) attributes and so on to say Allah again  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2443) like I'll give you one just final  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2444) example probably one of the most famous  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2446) ones  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2448) when someone came into my Malik and  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2450) asked him  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2452) how did Allah on the throne  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2460) is known in language it's known  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2464) and he says and the howliness of that  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2467) this is something which we don't know  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2469) well and to believe in that is  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2472) obligatory  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2475) and to ask about that this is an  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2478) innovation  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2480) so the template is basically that and  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2483) this was the position a very  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2484) straightforward one-liner you know he  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2486) wasn't going too deep and this and that  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2489) quite frankly I I I I failed to believe  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2492) I refuse to believe  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2494) that the sahaba when they were praying  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2496) and the time when they were praying and  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2498) these ayat comes  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2501) they were thinking about all these  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2503) debates  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2505) no way  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2506) that's that is something which we have  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2508) been plagued with because of the  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2510) controversies of today like they were  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2511) thinking of this or what that no how do  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2513) I think about no they were thinking  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2515) about  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2519) how magnanimous Allah is how powerful he  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2522) is how uh you know whatever all these  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2524) things  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2526) they weren't thinking about you know he  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2529) said listen Jad said that and they  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2531) weren't thinking about that I can  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2532) guarantee they were thinking about that  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2534) but in the first 100 200 300 years there  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2537) was this conscriptual conservatism but  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2539) there was a movement away from that when  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2540) there was threats extraneous threats uh  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2542) to the Muslim Al-Qaeda and that is uh I  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2545) would consider that the Hamby School  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2547) however authorism has developed by  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2549) ventimia with all of his positions  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2551) including  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2552) which  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2555) and these other things that's not now  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2558) we're not this is in a sense  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2560) differentiated from what the self  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2561) believed in because this was developed  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2564) certain things that even Tamia spoke  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2566) about the self never said ever is what  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2568) I'm saying they never said it his  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2570) rationalizations instead of necessary  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2572) his philosophization himself said the  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2575) Kalam approached the selfie  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2578) and and so there's there is a difference  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2580) here I'm not saying that the position is  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2581) different it's just a different  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2583) articulation he would argue to the same  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2585) scriptural point but now he's arguing  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2587) now extra scripturally as well but the  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2590) points uh overlap  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2593) and it doesn't mean just because of  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2595) maintainment says something that's what  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2596) the self-believed this is also false you  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2598) know so we have to we have to be fair  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2601) here and just and and say that there was  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2604) a development of course but in  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2605) development approach  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2607) there was not a development in actual  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2609) belief system here like the approach was  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2611) what was being developed  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2613) and the argumentative Style  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2616) and some of the workings out  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2619) and with that  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2620) we conclude the first part of this  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2622) series oh this particular episode  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2625) we're going to pray and come back  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2630) okay now before I move on to the um  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2633) school of thought I think it's important  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2635) to note there's a bit of a controversy  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2636) here between asha's and assadis as to as  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2639) relates as it relates to what is this  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2642) effect so if you read like a layer is  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2645) like  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2647) this kind of like main staple book  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2650) that's in the managed and so on  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2653) and other books like it like especially  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2655) if you look in conjunction with like um  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2657) what do you call it the saraf rajouri  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2659) Egyptian guy you know one of the top  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2661) guys by his you know the last 200 years  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2664) something like that they have Islamic  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2666) Egyptian scholar that I was we were  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2668) looking for them anyway  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2671) uh but uh you'll find that for example  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2674) they'll say that the the attitude  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2676) towards this effect although the correct  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2679) way is  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2681) and there's this question of what's the  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2682) difference between  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2684) almara  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2687) so let me explain to you this is one of  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2689) the major controversies so that if you  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2692) look at the authority school of thought  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2693) what they say is  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2695) especially for the capital was majorly  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2698) developed when you see a sifa of Allah  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2700) if you see an attribute of God that you  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2703) look at it on private facial value  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2705) and you uh take on board out the way it  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2709) is  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2710) so for example if Allah says  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2715) Allah has established himself on the  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2717) throne they will say yes the  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2719) establishment is something which is true  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2722) linguistically and the way which which  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2725) we do it is something which we don't  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2726) know because laser chemistry  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2727) that we don't know how that's done okay  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2730) so that's the other position  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2732) there's two ashady positions  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2735) one of them is  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2737) to say  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2741) we don't know what that means exactly in  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2744) relation to Allah  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2746) it's more less controversial where Allah  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2749) says uh  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2752) yeah would you avoid we don't know what  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2755) that his two hands are outstretched what  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2757) does two hands mean in relation to Allah  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2759) we leave it as it is this is a tough  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2761) weed position we don't know what the  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2763) meaning is  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2764) this is this is an ashari position and  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2766) it's the position of tofuite  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2770) the asari position is we know what it  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2772) means  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2773) but we don't know what it means in  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2774) relation to Allah it has the same kind  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2776) of consequence  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2778) does this make sense it's a different  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2780) it's different thing but the  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2782) consequences we don't know what it means  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2783) in relation to Allah in both cases the  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2785) consequence is the same  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2787) there's one consequence but the working  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2791) results are a little bit different but  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2792) this difference here is what has caused  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2796) controversy throughout hundreds of years  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2797) this is what I've just described to you  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2799) the difference  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2800) the question is okay whether or not it  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2802) should or shouldn't cause this much  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2803) controversy what is the truth of the  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2805) matter  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2806) because if we take a void position  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2808) seriously which is  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2811) I'll tell you the limitations on both  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2813) sides yeah  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2814) if we take the free position seriously  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2817) then I would say that if we don't know  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2819) what it means  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2820) than the early setup's position  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2821) according to the ashays is that the  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2824) salaf did not know what he means like  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2826) they didn't know when Allah is above the  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2828) throne  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2829) and if that's the case then the question  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2831) is why are they using different language  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2833) I'll see what I mean by that why are  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2835) they using words which are different to  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2836) the words of the Quran to describe  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2841) for example one phrase which you'll find  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2843) if you read  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2845) book that I just mentioned before or a  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2848) lot of the salaf is that Allah is  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2852) foreign  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2866) he is distinguished so he's  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2867) differentiated from his creation  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2870) now that puts into question the the  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2872) position because if what is being  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2875) suggested is that historically the early  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2877) salaf had tough weed as a position now  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2880) why are they using different language  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2881) why because if they're using different  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2882) language that would indicate they  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2884) understood the meanings and now they're  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2885) interpreting it in their own words  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2888) does that make sense this is very  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2890) important so it puts it it puts into  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2893) question the fact that what some ashadis  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2896) will say later that the position of the  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2899) salaf was a position of tough week  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2902) does that make sense  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2903) however having said that  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2905) some I'm not going to attribute the same  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2907) time yeah because I don't think he's  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2908) that unsophisticated but some later  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2911) salafis will say  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2912) that the position is is fully is BET  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2916) everything that you see of Allah  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2919) there is affirmation but we find that  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2923) some areas of Quran like for example  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2926) and we were talking about modular  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2930) College everything is destroyed except  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2932) for his face and they say no that means  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2934) him  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2935) that's a kind of it's a kind of  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2937) maneuvering here  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2939) which someone would be tempted to say is  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2941) this is the wheel  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2946) or Wednesday any way you turn in the  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2948) Quran it says you'll see the word to  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2951) Allah says this is the Qibla  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2954) so which Allah is not being interpreted  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2956) as well  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2961) so the issue of al-Qaeda  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2964) a principle which is consistent  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2966) throughout  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2968) I want to submit to you that if someone  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2970) if someone tries to have one principle  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2973) that you they will run across exam  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2976) counter examples is this not problems if  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2979) you say the position is tough week I'm  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2981) going to give you counter examples as  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2983) I've just done if you say their position  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2984) is it's bad I'm going to give you  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2986) counter examples the the correct  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2988) position is  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2990) it's full of the self  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2992) I mean this is what uh when Allah says  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2997) if they believe in what you guys believe  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=2999) in to sahaba  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3001) so what do we because they the  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3003) companions of the Prophet they had the  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3005) clearest understanding of the text it  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3007) was the language that they lived with  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3009) like we speak in English now they spoke  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3011) lines Arabic like that and it wasn't an  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3013) Arabic Egyptian Arabic which is mixed  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3014) with the Coptic and this and that or the  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3016) Moroccan Arabic which mixed with four or  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3017) five European languages  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3019) it's it was a pure qurashi Arabic it was  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3022) what they grew up with  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3024) for me that is more this this is this is  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3027) the quranic language  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3028) so when IBN Abbas says something I  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3031) followed my best so long as the sahih  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3033) the the sahiha  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3035) so if you say what the Imran best says  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3037) this in this situation it goes against  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3038) such a principle I'm not here to defend  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3040) the principle I'm here to do I'm here to  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3041) follow the the words and the Seraph  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3045) I'm not yeah I mean my position is I  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3047) have to defend this principle to death  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3048) and I'll make all this that we let and  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3050) it's not whether it's we call it tafuido  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3052) you call it it's bad these names  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3055) are not names necessarily  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3058) which we need to defend like we defend  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3060) the positions  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3062) of the salaf  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3063) so for me Yani a very good person who's  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3067) very sober in this approaches I  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3069) mentioned to you  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3070) and if you look at somebody in key  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3071) verses quite frankly he leans towards or  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3074) you could say he takes quite I'll make  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3077) the argument he takes the humbly  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3078) position  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3079) he does take the humbly position but he  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3082) doesn't do it in a way which later  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3083) selfies of today  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3084) would do it so he does it in a very  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3087) sober way and like for example he wrote  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3089) A type called guitar  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3094) and in it he mentioned Allah has he has  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3098) the attribute of yet  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3101) he's he's not saying in the language in  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3104) Yani the crass language as a later  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3107) salafi would say  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3109) he's yes he's affirming yes but he's not  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3112) going into detail finger hand this and  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3113) putting all these things together  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3117) there is a continuity with  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3122) the anthropomorphic is something that  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3125) can be anthropomorphized from a humanly  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3127) perspective so it's as if the person is  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3129) thinking of a human body and putting it  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3131) together  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3132) so the person for example let yourself  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3134) will not be saying hand  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3138) finger he'll just put hand finger and  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3141) shins in that order so it's almost like  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3144) you're putting everything  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3146) there is a common  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3148) linguistic commonality with human body  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3152) parts why are you putting all of that  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3153) together in a second that's not what  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3155) we're finding  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3156) uh with the tablet it's much more fluid  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3158) it's like you look at one air and he's  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3160) yes he's affirming everything but he's  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3162) doing it in a way which he's cognizant  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3165) of the fact that someone can interpret  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3166) this in a humanistic way and he's he is  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3169) being mature with that  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3171) that's how it should be done  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3174) so  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3175) ber is a great person as well to look at  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3177) in terms of Self in terms of uh because  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3179) his works are compendious as well  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3181) in fact he has his own that's how that's  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3183) how strong he was you know how we have  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3185) some awesome and so on his own  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3189) foreign  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3196) and so on and he has some very  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3198) interesting opinions about women leading  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3199) the prayer and all those kind of things  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3201) be surprised anyway the point is  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3203) certainly  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3204) um  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3207) Yani  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3208) uh there's issues here in the  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3210) articulations  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3211) but could could one argue that the the  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3214) Creed of the the early people was pretty  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3217) much the same yes you could argue that  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3218) you could argue they pretty much had the  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3220) same idea  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3221) but the articulations of it were a  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3223) little bit different and then there was  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3224) development now  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3225) ashari who's an individual who lived in  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3228) a martesley household As We Know  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3232) who died  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3235) 324 ah  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3236) so we're talking about so many  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3238) developments before even  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3241) was born  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3242) you know in the late third century  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3245) so many developments took place  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3247) so many discussions so many human beings  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3249) had lived and died  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3251) died in 241. you have Jad and uh even  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3255) Durham and would you call it an uh a  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3258) German safwan and all these guys came  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3260) way before the first century second  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3261) century first and second century  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3263) so you so at this point  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3266) there were  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3267) precursors and we're not saying that  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3270) there wasn't for example in collab  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3272) who died who was before  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3276) right he was there before and he was  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3278) making the same kind of arguments and  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3281) had the same kind of resistance  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3284) he wrote A Few books of them is one of  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3287) them which there's some kind of  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3288) contestation of authorship but he wrote  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3291) islamin which is a very interesting book  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3293) Luma he wrote as well and he wrote Al  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3296) Ivana now the one that's contestation of  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3298) authorship is Ibana  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3301) was basically him telling us what all  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3303) the different sects of Islam  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3306) you know and the Shia had done something  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3308) similar in fact this guy called  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3310) and so on so this was a heresy logical  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3314) Endeavor and this was being done by you  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3316) know the early people in Islam  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3320) I wrote  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3321) these books some discussion on because  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3325) there's some affirmation of attributes  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3326) and so on so some some people of later  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3328) time to say is not attributed to him  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3330) the the  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3332) countervailing or the counter argument  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3334) to that is that he had this he had a  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3336) student called the tabari not the uh  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3341) and history his Works have survived and  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3344) in fact he quotes alibana as we know  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3346) today in it which is a quite strong  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3348) evidence to show that alibana was  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3350) actually authored by Abu Hassan ashari  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3352) uh but anyway I mean it's neither here  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3355) nor there but it's interesting because  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3357) whether he died upon what did he die  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3359) upon as a question that you know so  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3360) people are asking and so on  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3363) but then  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3364) really you had a series of Scholars who  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3369) really laid the groundwork  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3372) for what we kind of see as a  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3374) methodological approach towards Islamic  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3377) Studies or Islamic critical studies  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3379) Systematic Theology whatever you want to  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3380) call it  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3383) yeah for example you had El Juani before  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3387) that you had Abu Bakr al-bakalani  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3389) foreign  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3393) they were pretty much the heavyweights  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3397) and then you had of course and then you  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3399) had  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3400) who uh mighty one of my teachers  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3403) actually his name's Amish Heather from  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3404) soas he considered arazi to be more  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3408) influential in them then  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3411) I think I mentioned to you before  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3417) and he wrote a book called tabakatul  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3420) ashaira  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3422) and he didn't put inside of el gazali  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3424) it's quite interesting is it Yani so  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3426) what's he trying to say and it was a big  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3427) name  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3431) you put it inside  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3433) but uh if you look at the kinds of books  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3436) like for example obviously we know it's  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3437) half of the philosopher we've maybe read  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3440) it we've seen it  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3442) uh  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3443) another one  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3445) which so a lot of issues to do with  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3447) philosophy and interestingly enough said  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3449) the following you said that I took two  
[0:57:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3451) years to study philosophy  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3453) now imagine now  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3455) it's impossible to become a master and  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3458) philosophy now in two years  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3460) but he said it took me two years to  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3463) study philosophy and like and all that  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3465) stuff and then he came out with whatever  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3466) he came out with  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3468) the interesting point about that is that  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3470) it shows you the Canon  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3472) that how limited they can't the  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3474) philosophical kind of was at his time  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3477) because you know you got the old gun on  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3479) and you've got the works with Aristotle  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3480) or whatever you've got then you have  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3482) what the philosophy for themselves  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3483) they've been seeing that and so on and  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3484) yeah then who do you have it's pretty  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3487) easy to exhaust all of that  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3489) and he exhausted it and he really  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3491) understood it it took him two years and  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3494) obviously he wrote to have the first  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3495) time which is the incoherence of the  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3496) philosopher of the philosophers which is  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3499) a stable work now  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3500) because he's he did a lot of things in  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3503) that book for example he had like  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3505) mathematical type arguments about  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3506) Infinity trying to prove the eternality  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3508) of the universe  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3511) he was using his uncle like he was  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3513) really going hard and heavy and if you  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3516) look at ebentamia's works like even here  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3522) he'll be it will tell me I will be  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3524) speaking and no no speech as the father  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3528) mentions  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3530) like you have an opponent in a sense but  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3534) the way he would be described by  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3535) bintamia is in a very endearing and  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3538) respectful way because his Mark that he  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3541) left was something which you cannot you  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3542) cannot disrespect as happy he called him  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3545) Islam he is the proof of Islam well what  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3548) kind I don't think he's used that term  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3550) with anyone else  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3551) he wrote a book as well I think is it's  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3554) not him that wrote the book over there  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3556) foreign  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3569) but look at what he was saying about uh  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3575) Islam the proof of this he called him  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3578) Islam in his  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3582) so  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3584) he was very special because he wrote  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3587) Mustafa  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3589) and obviously I forget the name of the  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3591) book now but Joannie wrote the the other  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3593) assoli book before it was called  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3595) um  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3601) so that was the first like major major  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3603) work but mostasso became like it  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3604) eclipsed everything else  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3606) and the stuff that and we went through a  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3608) lot a lot of it in a London series like  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3610) when we were talking about  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3611) consequentialism and stuff like that and  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3613) how he or this or that all these topics  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3616) he started up yeah very interestingly El  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3618) Mustafa was so popular  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3623) who also was athari and I think he's the  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3626) one who wrote the book called I'm I'm  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3628) not sure are you sure  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3633) it's very difficult to argue against  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3635) this point  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3636) yeah I mean he was humbling  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3638) and he wrote which is textbook yeah  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3642) it's one of the main humbly usually  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3644) textbook  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3646) but if you if we're honest about the  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3647) matter  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3649) who wrote the most famous  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3652) comparative textbook in Islam  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3656) You could argue morning  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3658) he  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3661) copied  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3664) and his role does another was basically  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3666) a his Road another an abbreviation  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3672) so much so that the early manuscripts  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3674) if you know that almost wrote  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3677) it has an epistemological beginning  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3680) all philosophy how how do you get a  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3683) knowledge you get Knowledge from this  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3684) the senses from the alcohol from this  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3686) like I said pathology that we went  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3688) through in Andrea that's in the  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3690) beginning of almost textbook  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3693) the early manuscripts and you can find  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3695) this online it's not open it's an Open  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3696) Secret any of them as another  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3699) it has an epistemological beginning as  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3701) well  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3702) so imagine you have ibno Kodama big time  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3705) the heaviest hitter in terms of the  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3707) Hamilton  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3708) of the motors he is so impressed with  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3712) that he writes a book which is basically  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3715) an abbreviation or summary of some sort  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3718) of  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3723) because and and by the way and we have  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3726) to be honest democrates who  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3728) it's not just in Academia that was a  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3730) scholar the map of disease in general  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3732) they were very um  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3734) suspicious of that kind of thing  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3736) they had a more conservative View and so  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3738) when when and why why would you find for  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3740) example another now when you look at it  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3742) you don't have that epistemological  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3743) beginning because a lot of them were  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3745) suspicious of it so get out of here so  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3747) they cut it out  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3748) so you won't find you know if you if you  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3750) get road to Northern now you the the  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3752) copies that you get from whatever you  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3754) get it from you're not going to get that  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3756) philosophical beginning especially not  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3758) if it's printed from certain bookshops  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3760) and certain countries in certain places  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3762) and census you're not going to get that  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3764) but that  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3769) deleting his works  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3772) because you're the scatter philosophy  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3778) but think about it the  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3780) most impressive and probably all of  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3783) Islamic history  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3785) who did we say who said that was the  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3787) three books and that we said that right  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3794) so yeah  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3796) because Tam heed is actually a book of  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3798) bakalani wrote a book called tamheed as  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3800) well  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3801) and that's very it's amazing yeah so the  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3804) usheri school of thought has brought  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3805) about without a shot of a doubt like  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3808) some of the most intellectual and genius  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3810) genius in Islamic history  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3813) Yani we have ibutamia  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3816) in Nursery School Hamburg School let's  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3818) say yeah  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3819) but the school have so many even 10  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3821) years  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3823) and that's sad to say  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3825) but but like they have some like people  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3828) that really are on his level like you  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3830) could not argue that he's he's not on  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3832) his level he cannot argue others he's  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3833) not on his level you cannot argue that  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3836) um what do you call him  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3838) you cannot argue join is on his level  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3841) you cannot  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3842) you know you cannot so there's a lot of  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3844) them there's a lot of these heavyweights  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3846) but quite frankly they agree with each  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3848) other on almost everything except for  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3849) arazi  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3853) of all of the four names I've just  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3855) mentioned which are probably the four  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3856) biggest  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3861) these are the four biggest in my opinion  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3864) yeah there's others and we're not saying  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3865) there's nothing of course in our office  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3867) here like an Amity he's huge now people  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3869) are looking at his stuff and uh would  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3871) you call him and Tamia engages with his  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3873) arguments a lot  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3875) um and so on but these four people  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3878) yeah  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3879) who are  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3883) you any  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3890) they're all  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3892) uh  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3894) they all have very similarities except  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3896) for atlasi  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3898) arazi is willing to step outside the  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3900) school  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3901) and we kind of looked in into that how  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3903) he does that for example he writes a  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3905) book called uh  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3907) the end of  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3909) the upper limits of basically  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3912) generous idea of aqual versus Knuckle  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3914) like what comes before you know the  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3916) arkle over the knuckle and so on  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3918) it comes really  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3920) this this comes from madrasi  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3925) yes yeah  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3926) but I think he mentions it in other  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3928) places as well like for example there's  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3930) another uh I think he mentions this it  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3934) comes it comes up and more than one work  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3937) but even Tamia is attacking if you  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3940) without a razi you probably don't have  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3943) him here doing what he's doing  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3947) without without Conor McGregor  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3950) ithm been on to it wouldn't be a  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3952) household name in Muslim sometimes you  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3954) just need that and it's Once Upon a lot  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3956) one of the things in Islamic history and  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3959) in all of history you just need some  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3961) people need to sharpen each other up  
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3962) there needs to be some without Tommy  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3964) Robinson maybe you know Lauren Southern  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3966) David wood though  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3969) maybe we wouldn't have we wouldn't be  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3970) here right now no but I'm saying that  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3972) because I'm not suffered I'm not saying  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3973) that is like David  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3976) no but I'm just saying you need this  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3978) antagonism don't let them know  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3981) the prophet says don't wish for the  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3985) coming of the enemy but at the same time  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3989) if you do meet him then you know  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3991) yeah  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3992) so in a sense you always this didactic  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3996) representation this dualism this story  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=3997) this storyline is like why do people why  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4000) do you think people would actually read  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4001) that  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4002) where is writing four pages and pages  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4005) and pages and Pages against lazy you  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4007) it's like watching a YouTube video why  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4008) are you watching these refutational  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4010) YouTube it's the same thing going on but  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4011) on a much higher level with way more  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4012) respect  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4016) but no but if you want me to show you  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4018) some some things in Asha is cool and in  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4021) the humble school where they accuse each  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4022) other homosexuality and they start being  
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4023) disrespectful I can show you that one as  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4025) well that's for a different video the  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4026) scholars  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4027) so this guy we think is he's you know  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4029) homosexual  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4031) no no it happens it's a human proclivity  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4035) but that's that's a different video for  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4037) a different day and this one this one  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4038) that was a womanizer and this one's  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4041) this stuff has always been there we  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4043) think nowadays we do complain about oh  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4045) as we do two video refutations now what  
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4047) the refutation is going on for years  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4048) in fact overall reservation these great  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4050) Scholars probably wouldn't even be known  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4051) to us  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4053) that's a bad that's how bad it is Yanni  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4055) well I  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4057) so two things we can pick up from this  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4059) is that you know great Scholars produce  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4061) great Scholars and and and when when  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4064) people come together Socrates  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4066) Socrates and Plato came out right after  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4068) him  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4069) he took from his Works he added on he  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4071) pushed us and then Aristotle uh yeah  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4074) Aristotle who he took from Plato  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4077) there's always that line of okay this  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4079) person's this intelligent person is  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4081) interacting with this other intelligent  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4083) person is creating this intelligent  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4084) atmosphere and they're all this all  
[1:08:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4086) these intelligent people are together  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4088) so two things which are good having  
[1:08:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4089) clever friends  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4092) clever friends and teachers yeah and uh  
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4095) and clever and strong enemies  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4098) or strong let's just say strong  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4100) opponents without without I'll be honest  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4103) with you one one of this is aside the  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4105) point you know who he is but one of the  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4106) ex-muslims uh you know anti-muslims and  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4108) stuff like that  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4109) I a private message to him I never show  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4111) my private messages  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4113) and I said to him listen I you know  
[1:08:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4117) I said  
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4119) I said why don't you go and do some  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4120) Arabic studies and Islamic Studies and  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4122) he said what are you talking about it's  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4123) like what do you mean by that  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4125) I said back in the days the orientalists  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4127) 100 years ago they were very formidable  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4130) they knew the Arabic they were they knew  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4132) Arabic poetry you have we have books  
[1:08:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4134) here more into this that they would look  
[1:08:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4135) into history  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4136) I would be quivering and shaking and  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4139) fear and fear and trepidation if I had  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4141) to present against someone who was my  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4143) Superior knowledge like that  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4145) I would but that but that would increase  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4147) me that would strengthen me that would  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4148) sharpen me that would make me something  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4150) into something different  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4151) but you have ruined me  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4153) because because you have you're honestly  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4158) because you are such an easy opponent an  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4160) unformidable opponent unworthy opponent  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4162) that  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4165) that  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4167) you have not challenged me to to go to  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4170) the next level  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4173) this is not fair we and the enemies of  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4176) Islam  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4178) he says that you know when you have like  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4180) the devil or something a formidable  
[1:09:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4181) opponent let me fight something good man  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4185) Tyson Fury can never really be one of  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4187) the greats not because he doesn't have  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4188) the skill but he doesn't have the  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4189) opponents  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4190) and maybe he doesn't have the skill  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4191) either but he will never be compared to  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4193) Muhammad Ali  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4194) oh Mike Tyson it's never gonna happen  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4197) because if why is Mike Tyson in the  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4199) conversation the best of all time  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4200) because he's beating so many good  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4201) opponents  
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4202) top guys  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4204) we need opponents  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4207) but we need to yeah that's why I'm  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4208) saying so don't be yeah and two things  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4211) and from this from this story that we're  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4212) looking at that we can look at is  
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4215) just guys that can help us to get to the  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4217) next level  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4217) share ideas sharpen the sword  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4220) metaphorically obviously just in case  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4223) and also and opponents who can also  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4225) challenge us bring us to the next level  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4226) because that's as human beings like  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4228) Michael Jordan  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4230) what  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4233) there's a famous Clips where he was  
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4235) saying like uh and that's when I took it  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4236) personally and then that's why I said I  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4238) took a person listen like man is almost  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4240) driven completely by his insecurity when  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4242) we start taking things personally oh  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4244) that's I'm ignorant this and that oh my  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4246) repetition's on the line then you go to  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4248) the next level  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4249) there's no it's no coincidence that  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4251) these ashady Scholars were as sharp and  
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4254) strong and genius as they were because  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4256) they were facing the matazida they were  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4257) facing the likes of Abdullah  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4263) different level  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4268) they'll come in with the Greek  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4270) manuscripts and this and that and they  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4272) had all workings out  
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4274) actually I had to spend day and night  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4277) with Candlelight and ink  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4280) that's what you have to think about let  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4282) me let me start systemizing my thought  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4283) let me start let me go to the cleverest  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4285) person here let me build institution in  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4287) the Army Institute that they had let's  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4289) do this let's do that that's why there's  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4290) so many intelligent people from that  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4292) school of thought  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4294) so so these are the four biggest names  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4296) that you should know but there are other  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4297) names like like we say we're not  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4299) we're not discounting that  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4302) um any questions so far  
[1:11:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4311) and you know interestingly they all  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4313) wrote about like that they all like and  
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4316) uh  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4317) and the Russian stuff they all actually  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4319) published works on logic  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4321) Ally wrote a book another very small  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4323) book you can use read it in one day  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4325) it's a logic yeah he wrote two or three  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4328) books on logic just purely on logic he  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4330) wrote a book called where he was trying  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4332) to get syllogisms  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4336) uh and razi also wrote a book called  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4339) It's also book on logic it was it was  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4342) tradition  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4343) it was and in fact someone who doesn't  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4345) study logic I don't trust him you cannot  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4348) be a jurist in Islam I don't try he's  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4349) not he's not all that again he might be  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4351) making a mistake we don't know if you're  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4353) gonna make a mistake or not  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4354) so they had this big focus on  
[1:12:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4357) montec and that's why they can come up  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4360) with the the arguments that they came  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4361) out with and obviously was very  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4363) interesting because he brought us a Sufi  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4365) element to solve test care element  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4367) you know and what because this happens  
[1:12:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4370) to a lot of a lot of people haven't met  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4372) when you're into like deep analytics  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4374) thought all the time and so you get  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4376) bored of it it's boring and just burns  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4378) your mind and Fries it up  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4379) so you think to yourself let me just do  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4381) something more raw honey now let me do  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4382) let me do something interesting and I  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4384) think he went through like some crisis  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4385) obviously he didn't he went through like  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4388) a proper spiritual experiential process  
[1:13:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4390) which is quite similar to you know  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4393) descar I think therefore I am I believe  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4396) he copied it for me somehow because this  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4398) whole systematic doubt thing that's  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4400) exactly what was Ali did he had the  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4402) systematic doubt thing and he went  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4403) through a crisis of faith and this and  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4404) that and he went to oh okay what can we  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4406) say for sure basically  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4408) uh but that's why you'll see like some  
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4411) of the books of ghazali like  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4413) especially yeah especially you know  
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4415) about test care and the purification of  
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4417) the soul and stuff like that he's got a  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4419) whole book of  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4421) and about love and um  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4424) about self-accountability and these  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4426) things and that's like the the Deep  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4428) purification spiritual tradition  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4431) and the one that I recommended to you  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4432) guys a long time ago which was uh  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4437) very easy book to read and it's been  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4439) translated into English it's called the  
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4441) beginning of guidance  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4442) you've read that alien actually I'll  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4444) give you on a copy I think you heard a  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4446) long time ago  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4447) with the beginning of guidance  
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4452) as well so it's it was a very uh the way  
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4456) he starts the book if you're doing this  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4458) for if you're doing this if you're doing  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4460) it for people's recognition or for  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4462) competition or for whatever then you  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4464) know that you're bankrupt basically ill  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4467) you're you're profitless your your  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4468) business is not making any profits he  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4472) didn't mean six figures and business  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4473) actual business no he meant your  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4475) spiritual business  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4485) so  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4489) we talked about lamady in 1931  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4492) and then you have obviously a sanusi you  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4495) know San Jose you know and so on this if  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4498) if someone's doing nizami schools or  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4500) whatever they'll go through San Jose's  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4502) kitab  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4503) and albutos I'm it's underwhelming in  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4506) terms of original thought it's not meant  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4508) to be like our original thought or  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4510) something like that it's not like hazeli  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4512) if you go from Lucy you think what's  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4513) going on that's nothing you went down  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4515) you've downgraded basically but it's  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4518) it's just like a  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4520) it is just a way to understand uh  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4527) yeah  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4528) they've got a book  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4530) the Cobra one if you read the book  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4533) it's fine and it tells you like this  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4535) house  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4538) and it says  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4541) you know these kind of things  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4543) and and then Arguments for God because  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4545) they have all that in there and actually  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4546) books you'll find almost in every  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4547) creedal book Arguments for God's  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4549) existence from imcan from Hadoop from  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4551) this interesting game  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4556) and as we know there's been lots of  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4558) famous controversies versus this was the  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4561) big one by the way it was the matter the  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4563) main event of the evening was the matazi  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4566) versus  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4568) and then and then that changed you could  
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4570) say slightly at the time of  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4571) entertainment  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4573) that he took the but the thing is arazi  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4575) was already dead before Evan Tamia  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4578) started refuting him and so he even  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4580) Tamia was around the same time as super  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4582) kid and so on and that was the issue  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4584) which is we're not going to get into  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4585) that now but uh the issue of this him  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4588) and his son basically the refuting on  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4590) the issue of and so like that but um  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4595) ashari versus philosophers so obviously  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4597) like uh famously of women Cena and for  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4601) four reasons he gave four reasons at the  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4602) end of the book  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4603) for that he doesn't know the Jews yet  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4606) that even said that Allah is not under  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4608) particulars and they haven't seen that  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4610) said that you know that the human bodies  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4612) are not going to be resurrected with  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4614) their actual body but only with their  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4616) soul  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4617) and there was one other thing which I  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4619) which I forget was there's four reasons  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4620) he gave and then obviously which  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4623) continues which is the main one today I  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4624) would say you don't have mountains it is  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4626) now I mean doing anything  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4629) yeah I mean  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4637) the question is basically um you know  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4639) the idea that the earlier is that they  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4641) were quite different to the data  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4643) development of the actually electoral  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4645) extent is that true and um like you know  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4648) what which Scholars were like  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4649) responsible for this like development of  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4651) the uh Ashley Creed  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4653) yeah so for example I'll give you some I  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4656) think examples we've used already but  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4658) I'll mention them again so for example  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4659) arrazzi  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4663) is you would say you know an ashari that  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4666) existed in the you know in the Middle  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4668) Ages if you want to call it that  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4669) whatever but he's refuted by simulating  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4671) some issues a San Lucy came afterwards  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4673) and obviously as we just mentioned he's  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4674) talks about or he his books are  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4676) mentioned  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4678) uh or a staple part of asha's reading  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4680) right reading list  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4682) so issue of Qatar for example  
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4684) like the issue of Qatar the issue of uh  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4687) he considers it to be  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4689) foreign  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4698) that the incent human being is  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4700) determined  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4701) but it only looks to be it only looks to  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4705) be like his free will he does not have  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4707) people basically  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4708) that's the largest position it's a  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4709) Christian feminist so this is something  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4711) which snoc Rejects  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4715) uh issues relating to for example so  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4718) this is a Qatar  
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4719) You could argue as well I'll give you  
[1:18:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4721) another example like a Waka bakalani  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4723) who's one of the early ashadis there's  
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4725) new manuscripts that have come to show  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4727) that he actually affirmed Allah  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4732) and lay Asha is like the one of those  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4734) polemical ones of recent times what a  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4736) guy called Zed khalsari I'm not sure if  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4738) you've  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4740) yeah yeah at that time around you know  
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4742) late 1800s early 1900s  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4745) who the one who famously said about  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4747) ibrahima's book was part of the salaf  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4749) because  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4754) that's how that's how hard he was like  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4755) even the salaf like he was he called it  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4759) anyway  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4760) uh uh  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4762) uh the one who actually refuted uh a  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4766) kothari was a my limit who as remember  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4769) he believes he was probably the most  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4771) intellectual country of the  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4772) entertainment in terms of certain in  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4773) certain issues industry School  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4776) so going back to the point uh what you  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4778) were just saying so  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4779) the issue of Allah being above the  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4781) throne it would seem to be in the early  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4783) School you could make the argument and  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4784) has been made the argument like that for  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4786) example  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4786) he believed Allah was above the throne  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4788) and that new manuscripts of his book has  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4792) have shown that as that kosari when he  
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4794) was making the arguments didn't know  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4796) that because the manuscript hadn't been  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4797) extended as time well that means  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4799) cataloged or whatever  
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4801) but now we have those Macs so so you  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4804) could see you could see a steady uh  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4806) differentiation or changing or something  
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4808) like that  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4809) after because and that's why I've been  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4811) telling me actually I remember reading  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4814) he really Praises this is the closest  
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4817) one to us and these kinds of things  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4820) uh so yeah you can see a steady  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4822) development from  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4824) and then El Juani starts to really  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4827) expand it a lot  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4829) so you can say if this is  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4832) it's probably going to be a Juani and  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4835) then obviously after that and razi just  
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4838) put the cat in with the pigeons  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4840) he put the cat in with the pigeons so uh  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4844) that's what you would say and then  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4845) obviously like a solution these later  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4848) it's by Julian whatever they took the  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4850) select positions of those in the in the  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4852) past and I mean they they filtered it  
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4854) out but if you mean today they're  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4856) probably just following the opinions of  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4857) the layoutis  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4859) that's what's happening especially for  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4861) this particular school of thought  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4862) whatever they're just following those  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4864) opinions there's no nothing wrong with  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4865) Yani but you have to admit  
[1:21:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4868) you have to admit that's what you're  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4869) doing here  
[1:21:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4870) a lot of the problems today is that  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4871) people don't know where they're getting  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4873) their opinions from why they're so  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4874) staunch on their opinions once you have  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4876) a Genesis of ideas okay this is where my  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4878) opinion comes from yeah it comes from  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4880) these people human beings colors then  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4882) you can start to really engage with them  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4885) fairly those ideas  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4888) time  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4892) yeah yeah so most of the kind of uh  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4895) archeries today will basically just  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4897) follow most of like uh  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4898) basically stuff that comes from  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4904) yeah or yeah not arazzi as much  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4908) yes and obviously uh certainly um  
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4912) those latest Scholars that wrote those  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4914) books like  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4918) yeah  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4919) so that's basically uh it guys we can  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4924) quickly talk about the Metro leader  
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4925) school I said I said I would talk about  
[1:22:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4927) them I'll quickly talk about that yep  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4930) he died 333 ah  
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4934) and he wrote a book called Hit  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4936) and um  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4938) obviously you have also within the  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4940) within the school you have a necessary  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4942) as well and this is the of the the NASA  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4944) fee Creed is something which is taught  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4945) to mentally these students  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4947) it's it's one of the the primary  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4950) uh  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4952) what do you call it Creeds and the the  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4954) books that he wrote is or the book  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4956) that's attributed to him is called  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4959) foreign  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4962) so another person who's worth looking at  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4965) in terms of giants of the metal school  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4968) and I wasn't sure whether he's murdered  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4970) or ashari is as we said before Saturday  
[1:22:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4973) dinner it was much later than obviously  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4975) those other two two seven ninety seven  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4977) ninety two  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4979) and he's on a childhood  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4982) so that's another interesting uh one  
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4984) another another book I was actually  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4985) reading when I was doing my work like  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4989) some some bath especially for Qatar and  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4991) stuff was this individual called he was  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4994) also matsuridi very interesting figure  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4995) and he uh  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=4998) uh he's got some very interesting um in  
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5001) fact he I was I was reading a segment of  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5003) his work which he was talking about the  
[1:23:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5005) differences between asharis  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5007) and asaris when it comes to something  
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5009) called uh  
[1:23:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5013) or whoever causes have effects  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5016) have actual effects  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5018) and I was surprised to find that Ibraham  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5020) actually took a view that's more in line  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5022) with mintemia  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5024) School  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5026) so that sometimes you'll find this kind  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5028) of unusual collaboration or it's unusual  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5032) things and you'll see for example that  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5035) there are differences between the usheri  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5036) school and the Metro School for example  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5038) one of those effects which are not  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5040) affirmed by an asharis and which are  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5042) affirmed by the methodology this is  
[1:24:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5046) very interesting many people don't know  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5049) that and there have been books that have  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5050) been written about the difference  
[1:24:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5051) between asharis and matolidis some of  
[1:24:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5053) them labeled them as like 20 differences  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5055) 30 differences but yeah most of them  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5057) would consider themselves from the same  
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5058) clothian  
[1:24:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5060) but it's interesting to know that  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5066) um yeah and by and to be clear I'm by  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5070) far not really  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5072) uh stuff what explains the marriage  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5076) between the asharis and the materials  
[1:24:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5078) just a similarity in Creed because they  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5081) have the same like the Fatal Mana where  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5082) most of them are the same uh I mean  
[1:24:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5086) think of it first of all about  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5090) they live in the same generation okay  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5092) they lived 10 years they died 10 years  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5094) apart from nine years one of them died  
[1:24:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5096) nine years together right  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5098) um and so there was a proliferation of  
[1:25:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5101) ideas and it became the acceptable norm  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5103) and don't forget there's a political  
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5104) impetus here as well because when Ashley  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5106) became a state religion it became the  
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5108) state religion  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5110) why is martialism let's just be honest  
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5112) why is martialism not on the radar like  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5116) it's a lot of it's just political  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5120) and you can you can make the same  
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5121) argument say well you're Saudi Arabia  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5122) yes the same argument no problem  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5124) a lot of these issues have got to do  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5126) with politics  
[1:25:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5130) as historians or as sociological  
[1:25:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5133) anthropologists have to say  
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5135) it's not like the mortalities have very  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5137) weak arguments everywhere some of the  
[1:25:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5138) arguments were very strong and robust  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5140) it's not the only some people who don't  
[1:25:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5141) exist now  
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5142) and don't occupy a space in the social  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5145) atmosphere it's not as if now they're  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5149) confined to the academic circles  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5150) whatever it's not like they don't have  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5152) any contributions and it's not like  
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5153) they're having big Scholars  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5155) they had their big swallows as well but  
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5157) they were just you know they were  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5158) overruled Danny if you like politics I  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5161) think politics has a big part to play  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5162) here  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5163) I do think I do think so  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5165) uh but yeah so this this was this was  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5169) the political ideas these were the ideas  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5170) that were  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5172) in the atmosphere at that time at that  
[1:26:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5174) particular time and they were similar  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5176) ideas so they they they married up a lot  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5179) in that sense but there are some  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5180) differences now we're seeing them in the  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5182) did I say that the upanish were maturity  
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5184) before so that was really right maturity  
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5188) so you know you're seeing with the  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5190) abundis and then the brother  
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5193) I saw particular uh debate between two  
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5196) individuals they were talking about the  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5198) shootout of debates for one hour  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5201) and my mom was over listening and she  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5202) said what's going on here she said she  
[1:26:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5205) said when they're gonna get started with  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5206) the debate I was I was listening to it  
[1:26:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5208) was actually quite means it was  
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5210) entertaining animals but I was I was  
[1:26:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5212) waiting for the debate to start because  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5213) I wanted to know like I wanted to have  
[1:26:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5214) more familiarity with the differences  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5215) between Australia's yeah  
[1:26:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5218) Unfortunately they never got to that the  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5221) accusations and adorable but I won't  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5224) complain about that because I'm the  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5225) master of Adams  
[1:27:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5228) um any questions before we continue  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5233) okay well hopefully that wasn't of  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5236) information overload  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5238) if it was then uh sorry about that but  
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5241) if even if it even if it wasn't you can  
[1:27:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5243) rewind and listen and take notes and you  
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5247) know even if they are copious notes you  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5249) got a question yeah yeah  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5252) what do you want to comment on them I  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5254) guess now that we know that this is  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5255) because obviously they've done a couple  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5257) of things firstly you've restricted uh  
[1:27:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5259) the discussion about  
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5260) I guess the schools of Sunny thought to  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5263) basically make these three  
[1:27:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5267) as well because they were quite  
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5269) prominent yeah so what ought to be the  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5272) attitude in relation to dealing with the  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5274) differences between these schools audits  
[1:27:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5275) to be as tolerant as the differences of  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5277) opinion for example is there more I mean  
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5280) to be honest with you like people that  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5281) consider themselves salafi yeah you'll  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5284) find people that can call themselves  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5286) seller fees  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5288) like for example some selfie jihadis  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5290) there's no way you can deal with them  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5292) unless it's going to be with on the  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5293) battlefield or something like that okay  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5294) I mean what are you gonna do if you meet  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5297) uh somebody who believes in neighbor as  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5298) fatwas but at the same time believes in  
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5300) taking your life  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5302) so it is like it really is contextual  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5305) like it does require or there's no we  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5309) don't believe in solofide a lot of  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5311) people nowadays  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5313) solo feeder is a Christian concept that  
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5315) you're saved by faith alone  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5317) a lot of people nowadays they are they  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5320) believe that they're part of the safe  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5321) sect and as a result they will not  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5323) practice spirituality they will not  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5325) practice self-accountability  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5326) self-responsibility they will they will  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5328) lose their spiritual side they have this  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5330) card now which is the safe sex syndrome  
[1:28:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5331) and they will spray everybody with it  
[1:28:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5333) that's the case  
[1:28:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5335) uh the Islamic attitude is actually one  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5338) of us  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5341) hold yourselves to account before your  
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5343) health to account forget about everybody  
[1:29:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5345) else and where he's going to heaven or  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5347) hell  
[1:29:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5349) all of them on the Hellfire  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5352) except for one you're going to the  
[1:29:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5353) hellfires No No this attitude is not  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5356) there's many things in Sharia which  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5358) Allah and the prophet saws they threaten  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5361) with the Hellfire  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5362) but it's not that if everyone does those  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5364) things that they're going to the hell  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5365) because Allah can forgive yeah  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5372) all my slaves  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5375) Allah forgives all the sins  
[1:29:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5377) so it's completely conceivable to  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5379) anybody with any particular  
[1:29:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5383) if they believe in that basic skeleton  
[1:29:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5386) that they will go to heaven I believe  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5388) that's what I've been telling me I  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5389) mentioned very very clearly what is what  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5392) is known to the Muslim people  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5394) that they would have to have real  
[1:29:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5395) disqualifiers do Japanese uh really go  
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5399) Annie you can't just kick someone out of  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5401) the mercy of God like that I personally  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5403) don't believe so so  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5404) yeah we we should be tolerant unless  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5406) someone is being intolerable it's just  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5408) because someone calls himself  
[1:30:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5411) it can be the most the worst one to you  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5414) can can stop you you can can take your  
[1:30:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5417) wealth away again  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5420) so it depends on the person and the  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5422) people in the group or the country or  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5423) whatever you have to look at it if the  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5424) person is worth collaborating with or  
[1:30:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5426) not and if the objectives are bigger  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5428) than the shackle that come about from  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5431) that's that's a pragmatic approach here  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5435) Allah come together and build goodness  
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5438) and taqwa  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5439) he doesn't say  
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5445) if you ask anybody to get me a more  
[1:30:47](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5447) Hostess for this particular verse get me  
[1:30:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5449) a specified someone says oh you cannot  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5450) collaborate with somebody who's from a  
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5452) different sect or even a collaborate  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5454) with a Shiite yes I'll collaborate even  
[1:30:56](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5456) with a Christian anybody someone who  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5458) wants to do good  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5460) obviously within context and reason I'm  
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5461) not gonna let Christian lead my prayer  
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5463) or cut my me in fact that one there's a  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5466) difference of opinion  
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5469) but you know I mean within within reason  
[1:31:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5471) and and judgment yeah every situation  
[1:31:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5473) has this thing but what I'm saying is  
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5477) yeah I need to come together  
[1:31:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5479) that's what Allah says in the Quran come  
[1:31:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5481) together in goodness and taqwa  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5484) in God Consciousness he doesn't say  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5486) except for those people or those people  
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5487) of that people Islam is an open and  
[1:31:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5489) Universal religion for everyone  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5491) no matter what your age race or sex

[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5495) truth  
[1:31:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5497) and we can actually say this we can say  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5498) that no matter what your age race or  
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5500) sexual uh

[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5506) Different Strokes for different folk  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5508) this person that person you can come  
[1:31:49](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5509) into Islam you can redeem yourself you  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5511) can cleanse your sins you can do what  
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5513) you want and within Islam those who want  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5515) to collaborate no I am that's fine  
[1:31:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5518) if it's going to confuse the matter if  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5520) you collaborate like we're doing this  
[1:32:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5521) guys we ever have a debate or yanny you  
[1:32:04](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5524) have to with everything is within reason  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5525) and within context but for me I  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5528) personally obviously believe in this I  
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5529) believe in that there's no specified  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5531) that advice therefore I take it Allah  
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5533) I take it completely absolute  
[1:32:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5536) any other questions  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5542) and by the way sorry on this point  
[1:32:23](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5543) someone will come with a letter and this  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5546) one then this one left across the road  
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5549) then this and that so if tell me if if  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5551) even butter or Bahari crossed the road  
[1:32:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5553) from muktada in the fourth Century does  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5556) that mean that I now have to taxis of  
[1:32:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5557) the verse of town  
[1:32:39](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5559) based on he crossed the road  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5562) because of his context and his times  
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5564) which is not mine not as different  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5566) context in different times  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5571) I might even go invite him to my house  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5573) just like him did when he invited bakri  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5575) to his house he says  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5581) Allah has destroyed the one who has uh  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5583) and they say is different opinions  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5586) actually so there's no muhasas going on  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5589) here so they get you some tenuous verses  
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5592) and Hadith and they say this shows you  
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5594) that you cannot no no sorry this no I'm  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5596) not convinced  
[1:33:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5598) I'm not convinced at all it's very very  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5600) unconvincing  
[1:33:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5602) about uh  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5605) exactly they bring the area is there  
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5608) some atoms foreign  
[1:33:52](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5632) foreign  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5639) so it says until they sit with  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5642) until they speak about another thing  
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5646) until until they speak about another  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5647) thing so when they speak about nothing  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5648) if it is  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5650) don't speak about don't don't speak  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5652) about the issues which you disagree when  
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5653) you speak about food and football and so  
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5655) I can sit with you then no problem  
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5658) it's not there's no and there's not  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5659) Ishmael  
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5661) in fact somebody mentions two uh two or  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5664) three different opinions on it so if you  
[1:34:25](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5665) get that area or you get the Hadith  
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5668) um  
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5671) you don't give me anything here to do  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5673) taxis  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5675) which which is that's it it's finished  
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5677) in my opinion it's done bring bring me  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5680) something I I want to believe you I  
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5681) can't say no but this this particular  
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5683) salaf in the third Century he crossed  
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5686) the road when he saw mutada  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5688) well he put his hands in his ears  
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5694) so this is going to Texas  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5698) because he's under  
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5701) I don't know what osul book is that  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5703) I don't know who  
[1:35:05](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5705) he said oh he saw that so he he put his  
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5708) hands in his ears so therefore you  
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5710) should do the same thing you should not  
[1:35:11](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5711) speak to your mom and your dad and your  
[1:35:13](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5713) brother and your sister and your friends  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5714) and your cousin that you've been  
[1:35:15](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5715) boycotting for six years

[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/nBAW5mZ_0a4?t=5722) yeah on that bombshell guys
