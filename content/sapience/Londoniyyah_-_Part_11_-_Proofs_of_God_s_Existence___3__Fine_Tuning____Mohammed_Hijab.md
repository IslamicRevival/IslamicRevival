BOOK A LIGHTHOUSE MENTOR

Are you or someone you know doubting Islam? Do you find yourself struggling to find answers?  Do you have a hard time speaking to someone about Islam?  Are you considering Islam but are unsure about certain concepts?  Are you an activist, Imam or community leader who is unsure about how to handle questions related to science, philosophy, the Islamic moral code, etc.?

You are not alone.  Over the course of the last decade or more there has been a rapid proliferation of content online and in academic institutions that has eroded the faith of some people.

Seeing the rise of  this phenomenon , Sapience Institute is introducing a One to One mentoring service called LIGHTHOUSE.

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=0) - [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=2100)

 Mohammed Hijab discusses the fine-tuning argument for God's existence. He argues that the universe is in a very specific state that allows life, and that this is evidence of the existence of a designer. He also discusses the concept of infinity, and how a designer could have an uninterrupted line of causation.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=0)** The fine tuning argument for God's existence is a straightforward argument that states that the universe is constructed in a way that allows life to exist. This argument is not based on aesthetics, complexity, ordesign, but on observable factors.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=300)**  presents evidence that the universe could not have been by chance, as it would have been non-life permitting. Richard Dawkins' book "The God Delusion" spends five pages discussing the "cosmological argument," which is William Paley's argument that because of the laws of probability, we don't need a god to explain design. John Lennox debates Dawkins on the topic, and convincingly argues that design is not a required reference to explain the universe.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=600)* Discusses how Craig's argument that there are three options for the constants in the universe- chance, necessity, or design- is flawed. He goes on to argue that chance is just an expression of our ignorance and that there cannot be a universe from chance.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=900)** Robin Collins argues that the fine tuning of the laws of nature and the constants of nature proves that there must be a designer. He provides an example of how the occurrence of a particular sequence of numbers could be evidence in favor of a demon hypothesis over a chance hypothesis.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=1200)**  Mohammed Hijab explains how to calculate the probability of a universe arising from chance or randomness. He speaks to a professor who confirms that he made a mistake with his numbers. Hijab then goes back to the professor and shows him the correct numbers. He discusses the fine tuning of the universe with a mathematician, who defines logical and inductive probability. He draws a conclusion from this lesson that when arguing for the existence of a designer, one must be specific and understand different types of probability.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=1500)* Discusses the argument from fine tuning, which states that there is a probability that specific constants in the universe are just right for life to exist. The presenter points out that this probability is impossible, and that an atheistic worldview provides no evidence for the existence of a creator. He then goes on to discuss the epistemic probability of there being something rather than nothing, and concludes that there is no possibility of an atheistic worldview being true.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=1800)* Discusses the fine-tuning argument, which is the idea that the universe is in a very specific state, allows life, and is stable/uniform/regular. The presenter argues that these conditions could not have happened by chance, and that they are evidence of the existence of a designer. The presenter also discusses the concept of infinity, and how a designer could have an uninterrupted line of causation.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkGjBAP7smc&t=2100)** Mohammed Hijab discusses some of the arguments used to disprove the existence of God, including the idea that patterns in the universe indicate that something with knowledge created them. He argues that these arguments need to be counterintuitive in order to be convincing, and that the best arguments for God's existence come from questions rather than statements.

[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=13) and welcome to another episode where  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=15) today inshallah we're going to be  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=16) discussing the fine tuning argument for  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=17) god's existence now this argument  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=20) although all kinds of teleological  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=22) arguments had been made before  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=24) and teleological arguments sometimes  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=28) can can refer to most of the times will  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=30) refer to things with purpose  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=32) but always will be linked to some kind  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=34) of a design  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=35) in this case this fine tuning is is a  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=37) very specific type of teleological  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=39) argument  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=40) which uh in particular  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=42) uh deals with the issue of life  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=45) permitting universes  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=47) or lpu's life permitting universes  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=50) and uh i'm going to go through  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=52) insha'allah today some  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=54) of the most prominent ways that this  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=57) argument is being made both in  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=59) apologetics circles and or the  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=61) philosophy of religion  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=63) and then we're going to discuss some of  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=64) the strengths and limitations of this  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=66) argument some of the objections to this  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=67) argument and how i prefer to use it i  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=70) mean  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=71) we've already spoken about the  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=72) contingency argument and uh  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=74) in many ways the contingency argument i  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=76) see as the usual is the foundation for  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=77) all arguments in terms of demonstrative  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=79) proof  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=80) um  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=82) not just the contingency argument but  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=84) the the question the quranic question  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=86) which is  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=88) where they created from nothing or were  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=89) they themselves the creators of  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=90) themselves  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=91) this proposition  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=94) of  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=95) the the fact that they cannot be  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=96) something which is self  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=98) generating or self-maintaining  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=100) is is the basis for all arguments for  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=102) god's existence and we talked about  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=104) before the very  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=105) important but very basic question where  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=107) we all start from which is why is there  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=109) something rather than nothing  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=111) a very difficult question for  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=113) atheists to deal with  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=115) but that's the basis this is something  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=117) which can be used sometimes  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=118) as a  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=120) supporting  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=121) argument  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=123) so this these are the kind of points  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=125) that you could talk about in terms of  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=126) the fine tune or that are being spoken  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=128) about in terms of the fine-tuning  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=129) argument number one that initial  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=131) conditions of the universe must be  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=133) adjusted just right in order for life to  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=135) exist now this is called the life  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=136) permitting range the fine-tuning  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=138) argument let's talk about what it's not  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=140) it's not saying that the universe is  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=142) beautiful and aesthetically pleasing and  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=144) therefore it must have a creator  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=146) it's not saying that the universe is is  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=149) designed so immaculate and um it's so  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=151) complicated and therefore it must have a  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=153) creator  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=154) these are not what the fine-tuning  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=156) arguments of today  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=158) are stating that the fine-tuning  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=160) arguments of today are stating  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=162) that the universe  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=165) is  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=168) constructed in a way which allows life  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=170) to exist  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=172) human life no it could be any life  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=175) so there is a life permitting range  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=177) and this is an incontrovertible and  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=179) indupitable fact  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=181) and nobody has actually denied that the  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=184) fact that there is life the fact that  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=185) there is life in the universe i mean who  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=187) can deny that yeah the and the secondary  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=190) fact which is that the universe  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=191) therefore allows  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=193) life to exist within it it's  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=195) you can have a habitable life in the  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=198) universe  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=200) these are two clear  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=202) straightforward facts  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=205) okay  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=206) now  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=210) how this argument is usually made is  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=212) that they say well you've got these  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=214) constants  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=215) uh you have these different constants or  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=217) you have these fundamental constants  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=220) and they could be six nine depending on  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=222) what you decide to count and what you  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=223) decide not to count  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=225) which  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=227) if they were  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=229) any different  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=230) by the smallest of margins  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=233) by  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=235) the breadth of a you know hair  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=237) hair splitting difference  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=239) then  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=240) the universe wouldn't exist as we know  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=242) it and or would not allow life to exist  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=244) within it that's a very straightforward  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=246) argument isn't it  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=247) and i think this is this is why it's the  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=249) potency of the argument almost anyone  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=250) can understand it  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=252) you know  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=253) let me tell you one more time before we  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=255) get into this this is not uh william  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=257) paley's watchmaker's argument  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=259) this is not william paley's watch pick  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=261) and lagrange which richard dawkins spent  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=263) so much time trying to refute  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=265) because william paley's watchmaker  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=266) argument in natural theology was that  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=270) you know you're walking around you see a  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=271) watch you know  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=272) and he referred to it as contrivance  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=274) actually the word contrivance now  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=275) usually is worth used pejoratively  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=278) you know if you contrive something it's  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=280) as if you're trying to superimpose some  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=281) kind of a narrative on something  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=283) pre-existing but in his terminology and  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=285) when he wrote this book  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=287) natural theology in the whatever it was  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=289) he wrote it  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=290) he meant that it's got exhibiting  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=293) factors which indicate that it's been  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=295) carved into being  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=297) not like a rock so he compares a rock to  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=299) a watch so when you're walking in the  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=302) you know forest or whatever it is desert  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=304) or forest or whatever example you like  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=306) you see a rock  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=308) and you see a watch you know that the  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=310) rock has different qualities to the  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=311) watch  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=312) because the watch has uh has contrivance  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=314) this contrivance this is seeming uh  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=318) constructions which are  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=320) superimposed or not superimposed that  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=322) they are carved into being by some  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=324) higher intelligence and the inference  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=326) therefore that is made  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=328) is that it was  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=329) there was a designer there was a  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=330) watchmaker  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=333) richard dawkins  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=334) and probably  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=336) the only argument he actually spends  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=338) time trying to deal with because if you  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=340) look at  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=341) the his books of the god delusion  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=344) hundreds of pages the god delusion but  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=346) he only spends five pages on the  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=348) cosmological argument i don't know if  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=350) this is something you knew or not but he  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=352) spends five  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=353) five pages  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=355) on the cosmological argument and two  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=357) pages i think to the ontological article  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=359) something like that the rest of it is  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=361) just some kind of  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=362) run about religion and what it does you  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=364) know a moral run even though as we  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=366) mentioned before he doesn't have  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=367) anything to base morality on according  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=369) to himself  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=370) but he does spend some time in his other  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=372) books especially the blind watchmaker  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=375) talking about this argument which is  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=376) william paley's argument he does spend  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=378) some time talking about it and basically  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=380) he says because of the theory of  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=381) darwinian evolution  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=384) and this is the argument he made with  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=385) john lennox in the debate that he had  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=387) series of debates that he had with him  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=389) he says because of the theories of  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=391) darwinian evolution we don't need he  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=393) says we do not need  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=396) a god to explain design because  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=400) he states that  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=402) designers  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=403) is understood through the darwinian  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=404) mechanism  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=405) and so any reference to god is  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=407) superfluous  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=409) it's um it's not a required reference  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=411) it's uh  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=413) john lennox just to give you to kind of  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=415) spoil the story for you if you haven't  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=416) already seen this  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=418) and he answers this very well to his  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=420) credit  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=421) he states look he's what richard dawkins  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=424) is doing is confusing mechanism and  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=425) agency  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=427) mechanism is how something is being done  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=430) so even if we agree he states  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=433) that there is such a thing as the only  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=434) evolution that's the mechanism through  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=436) which life comes into being  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=440) but agency is well through what will was  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=442) it a guided or unguided process  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=445) and he's saying that just because  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=446) there's a mechanism of something  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=448) happening it doesn't mean there's no  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=449) agency behind it like for example the  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=451) train i'm just my example now a train  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=453) can move from one station to another  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=456) but it doesn't mean because we can we  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=458) can explain the mechanics of the train  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=460) or car can move like i got here by  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=462) driving  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=464) i can explain to you mechanically and  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=466) scientifically how the car moved when i  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=469) came here  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=470) and that would be the equivalent in this  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=471) analogy of darwinian evolution this is  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=473) how it happens  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=475) if we accept all the premises for the  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=476) sake of argument  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=478) but it doesn't explain how the car came  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=480) from this place to that place  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=483) with a blind  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=484) or blindly and usually this is exactly  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=487) the wording he used blind watchmaker  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=488) meaning it's an unguided process  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=492) the theist is saying no it's a guided  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=493) process it has to be a guidance process  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=495) like when i came here  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=497) the best way to explain how i got from  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=498) home to here is through me driving it  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=500) i'm the agency i'm the driver  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=504) so the reason why i put this to you  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=506) because some people sometimes get  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=507) confused between this type of  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=508) teleological argument which is  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=511) most famous in western circles through  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=513) william paley  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=515) and the fine-tuning argument they're not  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=516) the same thing although there is clearly  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=518) a flesh that joins the two types of  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=520) argument  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=521) which is the idea of design  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=524) the fine tuning argument just to repeat  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=526) is an argument that states explicitly  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=530) it's an argument that states explicitly  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=532) that the universe couldn't have been  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=534) by virtue of probability okay  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=538) and i'll tell you what they mean by  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=539) probability we'll go into more depth  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=542) it couldn't have been  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=544) um  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=545) made in a way or it could not be in such  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=547) a way  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=548) that would be life permitting  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=550) okay  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=551) had there not been a designer and the  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=553) probability of that not being the case  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=555) is  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=556) infinitesimally small  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=558) and they'll give you numbers they'll  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=559) literally give you numbers  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=562) and how can they give you numbers  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=564) they'll give you numbers based on  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=566) the  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=567) the constants so the most popular one  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=570) that they use is the electromagnetic  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=572) constant  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=573) the rather the gravitational constant is  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=575) probably the second most popular  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=577) but the electromagnetic constant is is  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=579) the one that's probably the most popular  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=581) one that they use  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=583) and you can see here on the slide  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=586) because if it was larger than zero the  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=588) universe would accelerate at a stage  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=591) okay  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=592) which would make life not permit it  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=594) would be non-life permitting  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=596) and if it were to decelerate  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=598) the opposite would happen  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=600) and also the the the  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=602) life permitting range would be obscured  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=604) or otherwise inhibited  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=607) or negated even yeah  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=610) and so  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=612) this is an example the electromagnetic  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=614) constant  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=616) and so the way craig makes this argument  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=619) in his uh in both his works his actual  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=622) written works  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=623) uh and also his uh publications  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=626) apologetic publications  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=629) is that he states there's three options  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=632) you've got these constants  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=635) and you have three options  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=636) either it was from necessity  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=638) either was from  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=641) he says  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=642) chance necessity or design these are  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=644) your three options  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=645) and he says that the chance or the  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=647) possibility that this could have been  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=648) from chance  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=650) i'm talking about william lane craig by  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=651) the way when i said craig just in case  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=653) anyone who doesn't know who i'm talking  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=654) about he says the possibility that it  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=655) was from chance is and it'll give you  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=657) some numbers this this this amount  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=660) which is infinitesimally small  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=662) and it couldn't have been by necessity  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=663) because there's nothing necessary about  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=665) the laws of nature and therefore it must  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=667) have been by virtue of  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=669) elimination design this is the but i  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=672) don't i don't agree with the way that  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=674) this argument is being made  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=675) and i in the beginning when i was  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=677) younger  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=678) some years ago i used to like this  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=679) argument  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=681) but now  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=682) when i uh  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=683) when i thought about a bit more deeply  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=686) i think this argument is actually flawed  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=688) um  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=689) and we can make a stronger argument in  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=690) this i'll tell you why  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=694) first and foremost yes  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=697) necessity  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=699) i agree with the sentiment that there's  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=700) nothing necessary about the laws of  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=702) nature true  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=703) but does necessity and i spoke to to be  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=706) fair uh  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=707) alistair mcgrath actually when i was in  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=709) the university of oxford i spoke to him  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=710) about this directly and had a  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=712) conversation with him about this  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=713) and i said and this actually came from  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=715) faraz zahabi i was mentioning him today  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=717) in other contexts  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=719) but he gave me this idea and i had a  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=720) conversation with him because he's got a  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=721) background of philosophy as well  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=723) and he he brought this up to me and i  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=725) thought this is actually very clever  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=726) what he's saying  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=728) and then i brought brought the attention  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=730) of alistair mcgrath and he he agreed  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=731) with me on this  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=733) necessity does not threaten the theistic  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=735) conclusion  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=737) if we say  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=738) that the  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=739) the laws of nature are necessarily that  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=741) way  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=742) so what  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=743) because we've already explained  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=745) okay  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=746) that so long as it's not a necessity in  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=748) the category of existence then we're not  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=751) doing  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=752) that we're not enumerating the the  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=754) necessary existences  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=756) we're just saying it's a necessary fact  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=758) so what if this is if so what if it's a  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=760) necessary fact that the laws of nature  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=762) are  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=763) in xyz way so what  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=765) it doesn't do anything it does it  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=767) it does nothing to to threaten the  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=769) theistic conclusion  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=772) so there's no contradiction so in a  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=774) sense it's a false  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=775) i'm not sure if this is a word but  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=776) trichotomy i don't know if this is if  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=779) someone can research if this is a word  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=781) it's not it's a false kind of separation  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=783) here  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=784) okay  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=785) because you can't  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=786) it's not either or it can be we are  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=789) saying design and necessity those two  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=792) things shouldn't be there's no necessary  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=795) separation between those two things so  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=796) at first i thought yeah craig is on to  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=798) something but now that i think about i  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=799) think craig is wrong for separating them  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=801) like this  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=805) and moreover  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=806) i think craig is wrong again  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=810) and  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=812) in so much as he  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=814) talks about chance now what is chance  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=817) and i've had conversations with people  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=819) about this  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=820) and to once again for us the hobby does  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=822) a good job and in my discussions with  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=824) him that you know very casual  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=825) informative discussions in the car and  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=827) whatever he makes a really good point  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=829) what is randomness what is this chance  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=831) that we're talking about  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=833) and he he argues  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=834) and he should have this written  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=836) somewhere because he makes a really good  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=837) point you know  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=838) he argues that actually chance is just  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=841) something which we don't understand  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=843) it's it's chance is an expression when  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=846) we say randomness or chance on these  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=847) things  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=848) well he talks about randomness let's be  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=850) clear right he talks about randomness if  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=851) someone says random the word random has  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=854) specific connotations  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=855) random something which is random is just  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=858) you're talking about something which you  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=859) can't explain it's just an expression of  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=860) your own ignorance if you knew the prior  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=863) conditions you'd understand the workings  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=865) out but because you don't know the prior  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=866) conditions you don't know the workings  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=867) out  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=869) is a little bit different we're gonna  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=870) talk about what chance is  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=872) probabilistically and what they mean by  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=874) chance and how to be fair i don't accept  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=876) what they mean either when i say they  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=878) i'm talking about the philosophers of  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=879) religion  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=883) so is there and can there be a universe  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=885) from trance i say that's impossible i  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=886) don't i don't think that's an option  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=889) and i'm going to argue that in what  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=890) follows but um before we get to that  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=893) i'm going to tell you what they mean by  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=894) chance because it's it's a bit of an  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=896) elaborative discussion okay  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=898) so  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=899) you can say  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=901) it you could say  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=903) you one can say  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=905) that is from chance  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=907) but it's not an actual option it's  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=909) impossible for it i'm saying it's absurd  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=911) for it to be from chance i'm saying that  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=913) necessity  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=914) and design should not be separated  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=918) that's what i'm saying  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=919) and therefore the conclusion is only  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=922) that there had to be some something  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=924) which put  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=925) a lawmaker that the that put the laws  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=928) into place  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=929) there's only one conclusion this this is  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=931) because when we say there's three  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=932) conclusions it's like okay you can  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=934) choose now whatever you like  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=935) and probably one of the first videos  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=937) i've ever done in youtube that got the  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=939) first one that got viral  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=941) is a conversation i had with a guy in  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=943) speaker's corner  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=944) and i told him there was the chances of  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=946) me  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=947) grabbing up you know some some um  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=951) i was like 24 at this time you know and  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=953) i was affected by this stuff  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=956) what's the chance of me putting  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=959) you know  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=961) letters into a bag and  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=963) shaking it up and throwing onto the  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=965) floor and it becoming like macbeth  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=968) and he stated oh it's very low i agree  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=973) but xyz is still possibility  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=976) given given an infinite multiverse  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=978) whatever it may be yeah  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=980) and across the years when i've been  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=982) thinking about this  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=983) i say no i say that  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=985) i'm going to come to this there's no  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=987) chance of it happening and we're going  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=988) to come to why i say that  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=990) this is it's not there's no such thing  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=991) as chance like that  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=993) and especially considering  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=995) you can't even explain why this bag of  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=997) letters came there in the first place in  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=998) the case of our universe you can't  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1000) explain how the universe came in first  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1001) why is there something rather than  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1002) nothing why is there such a bag of  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1004) letters  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1006) you see  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1008) so there's no chance  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1009) and this is a very strong conclusion but  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1011) it's uh hopefully going to be justified  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1012) before we get there  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1014) i want to talk about how they present  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1016) this argument in the philosophy of  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1017) religion  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1018) so one of the key proponents of this  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1020) this type of argument is a guy called  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1021) robin collins  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1025) and he  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1026) he says  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1028) the core fine-tuning argument relies on  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1030) a standard principle of confirmation  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1032) theory the so-called likelihood  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1034) principle this principle this principle  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1036) can be stated as follows  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1039) let h1 and h2 be two competing  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1041) hypotheses  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1042) according to the likelihood principle an  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1044) observation e counts as evidence in  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1046) favor of hypothesis one  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1048) over hypothesis two of the observation  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1050) is more probable under h1 than h2 you  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1053) can see why this is this kind of  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1055) groundwork is going to be required in  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1057) order to then say well this possibility  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1059) that has come from design or this  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1060) possibility that come from chance  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1062) but what i'm saying is h1 and h2 are not  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1064) actual options  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1067) and we'll come to that yeah  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1070) so he gives an example  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1072) to illustrate the need  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1074) for the restricted version suppose that  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1075) i roll a die  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1077) 20 times and it comes up  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1080) some apparently random sequence of  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1082) numbers and he gives a long list of  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1083) numbers yeah  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1084) the probability of it coming up in this  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1086) sequence is one  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1088) in three point six times what 10 15 yeah  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1091) or about one in a million billion  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1096) to explain this occurrence suppose i  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1097) invested in sorry invented the  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1099) hypothesis that there is a demon  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1102) whose favorite number is just the  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1104) aforementioned sequence of numbers  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1106) and this demon had a strong desire for  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1108) that sequence to turn up when i rolled  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1109) the die now if this demon hypothesis  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1112) were true then the fact that the dye  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1114) came up in this sequence would be  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1116) expected that is the sequence would not  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1118) be epistem epistemically  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1120) improbable  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1122) consequently by the standard of the  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1124) standard likelihood principle the  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1126) occurrence of this sequence would be  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1128) would strongly confirm the demon  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1130) hypothesis over the chance hypothesis  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1132) you see the chance hypothesis which we  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1134) don't believe is is a plausible one in  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1136) the first place  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1138) but this seems counterintuitive given a  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1140) sort of common sense notion of  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1142) confirmation it does not seem that the  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1143) demon hypothesis is confirmed  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1146) and so here these are the three types of  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1150) evidences they use okay when  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1153) when they're talking about the chance  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1154) hypothesis and versus the the god  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1157) hypothesis if you like these are the  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1158) kind of things they use the fine tuning  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1160) of the laws of nature  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1162) the constants of nature and the  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1163) fine-tuning of the initial condition of  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1164) the universe  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1166) now when he talks about probability  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1168) probability is a mathematical concept  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1169) but be careful because there's different  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1171) kinds of probability  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1172) so especially in fine tuning when they  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1174) say probability and  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1175) i don't know if i told you this story  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1177) before  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1178) but when i first got into this  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1180) like what six seven years ago  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1182) i had a conversation with a  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1184) mathematician  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1185) let's say about this  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1187) okay i'll tell you this is a story i had  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1188) a conversation with he was a professor  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1190) in one of the german  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1193) central european universities yeah  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1196) and it was a private discussion thank  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1197) god you know  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1199) and  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1201) he saw the video that i told you about  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1202) with um  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1205) with the guy and i was talking about the  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1206) probability of the universe coming from  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1208) from from chance or randomness or  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1210) whatever is this number  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1214) which was like a very low number yeah  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1218) and he said what kind of probability are  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1219) you using  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1221) he goes because if you use base theory  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1223) and he sent me this kind of long list of  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1225) he got he got these constants he put  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1227) them in a  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1228) you know thing and he said uh what do  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1230) you think  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1232) i said i looked at it i don't know what  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1234) he's talking about  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1236) but i don't know because he was being a  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1237) bit arrogant  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1238) so i didn't want to concede  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1240) i didn't want to say anything  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1242) so i just looked at him i said hmm  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1245) let me think about this for a second  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1247) but before i continue uh  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1250) i looked them in the face i said  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1252) are you sure you got those numbers  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1253) correct  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1257) he said uh yeah i'm pretty sure and he  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1259) had a smug you know this guy's a  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1262) professor in mathematics and who am i  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1263) i've  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1264) i haven't done anything in mathematics  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1266) at the level that he has  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1269) okay  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1270) i i said you know here you go check it  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1273) he said okay  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1274) i said i tell you what  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1277) professor  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1278) i think you should double check your  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1280) numbers  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1282) because no no i said you know i think  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1284) you should double check your numbers  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1286) because you  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1287) you've written a couple of things here  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1288) which i need to process properly but i  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1290) don't think  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1291) just double check your numbers and we'll  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1293) talk about this later  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1294) okay and they were and i went  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1297) and i went and spoke to some  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1298) mathematicians or some people that were  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1300) good at maths and i showed them i said  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1301) what's this man so this is base theory  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1303) and he you know it showed me this how it  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1305) works and this is  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1306) and it was long man and you know i  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1307) haven't i haven't covered base series  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1309) like this before yeah  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1312) and he's explained he actually hadn't  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1314) made a mistake  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1315) the guy i said are you sure this is a  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1317) mistake  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1318) because i want some brother that's just  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1319) a molly guy you know  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1321) and uh  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1322) he said yeah he made a mistake here he  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1323) made there i said are you sure he said  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1326) yeah  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1327) so i went back to him and  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1329) said that  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1330) so did you check your number is it  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1336) he said  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1337) i said you this is what you wrote and  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1338) this is how it should be  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1340) you know and he said  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1342) i said that's right i said  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1343) next time you have to be sure  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1346) and then i just dragged it into a  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1348) philosophical discussion but from this i  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1350) learned  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1351) that when you're talking about the fine  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1352) tuning it's you've got to be very  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1353) specific and moreover  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1356) not only do you have to be very specific  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1357) you have to understand the different  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1358) types of probability so in the  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1360) philosophy of religion usually the way  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1362) that these guys make the argument like  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1364) when i say these guys  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1366) i'm talking about swinburne for example  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1368) richard swinburn makes this argument  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1369) like this  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1370) craig to a lesser extent this guy wrote  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1373) what's his name colin robbins  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1376) they use what is referred to as  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1378) epistemic probability  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1382) and episomic probability is divided into  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1384) two different types  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1385) there's a subjective type  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1387) which i think we have we've discussed  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1389) before in this class which is the idea  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1391) that you know your standards you already  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1392) know like this is probably going to  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1394) happen this is not going to happen  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1395) and most reject this type of probability  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1398) as a way  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1399) of trying to  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1401) assert the truth of a designer for  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1403) example  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1404) so they're left with what you call  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1405) logical  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1408) logical epistemic probability referred  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1410) to by swinburne by the way as inductive  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1413) probability  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1415) and  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1420) i tried to look for different  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1421) definitions of it oh  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1423) and planting had this uh  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1425) very cryptic definition i'm gonna try  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1427) and break it down for you okay  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1429) where he says this he says  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1433) he's defining a conditional epistemic  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1434) probability  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1436) after the symbols that he puts in place  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1439) of some conditional propositional  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1441) statements okay and we'll go through  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1444) propositional logic uh later so this  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1447) kind of thing will become  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1448) more intelligible to you  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1451) so he puts b and then bracket a  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1456) and then  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1457) that figure there and then b and then  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1458) close bracket equals  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1460) and then you can see that this is the  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1461) smallest interval which contains all  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1464) the intervals  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1465) which represent the degree to which a  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1467) rational human being s  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1470) whom believed be had no  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1472) undercutting defeater  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1474) for a  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1475) had no other source of warrant either  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1478) for a and or not a this should be not a  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1481) yeah  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1482) was aware that she believed b  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1485) and considered the evidence bearing of b  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1487) on a  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1489) now  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1490) this is  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1492) in layman's terms is saying let's  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1495) imagine the counter factual possibility  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1497) here  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1499) so imagine that you have a universe  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1502) that was  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1503) not designed  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1505) and let's see the probability of that  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1507) being the case  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1509) this kind of probability allows that but  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1511) what we're saying is that counterfactual  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1512) reality itself is an absurd one  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1516) you you can try and  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1518) the thing is the moment you try and  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1519) imagine that what i'm saying is  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1522) you're falling into an absurdity you're  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1523) falling into an impossibility  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1526) and i explain why yeah  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1530) the assumption of chance  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1533) this assumption that they can't be the  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1535) equivalent of a null hypothesis here  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1537) something which you get a zero  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1539) that or some chance that can create can  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1542) can can move around the universe the  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1544) constants and the laws of nature  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1545) whatever  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1547) this assumption is no way whatsoever  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1549) there's no chance there's no um evidence  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1551) for it  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1555) there's no evidence for it and you're  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1556) you're stuck again because how can you  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1558) get something from nothing  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1560) so i don't like this  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1561) way of making the argument  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1564) in addition you've got  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1566) another issue with with this argument  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1568) which is that  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1569) what if there's some quantum theory that  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1571) overlaps all of the or some major theory  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1573) that bridges the you know the quantum  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1575) world with the physical or the macro  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1576) world and the electromagnetic constant  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1579) uh gravity all these other things that  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1581) we we talked about  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1583) they become less potent as explaining  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1585) forces or that those numbers change and  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1587) all this thing is possible with the  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1589) corridable and volatile nature of  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1590) physics  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1592) so does that mean  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1594) that the argument can be made in the  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1595) same way no it wouldn't be made in the  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1596) same way  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1598) which brings us back to what we spoke  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1600) about in the previous sessions which  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1602) instead of talking about these constants  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1604) what i prefer to do and obviously  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1605) everyone's free to do their own thing  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1607) but  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1607) is talk about not the things which  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1609) science discovers but the things which  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1611) is required for science to be done  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1614) because it fits the timeless criterion  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1616) in a better way  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1618) so in other words in order to do science  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1620) what do you need you need a regular  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1621) system a stable system and a predictable  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1623) system  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1625) and the regularity and predictability  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1627) and stability of sight of the world  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1630) is established beyond beyond reasonable  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1631) doubt and and if it's not established  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1633) then you wouldn't have science now just  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1635) to remind you the example that we gave  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1639) is that you know you have  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1640) this phone is not blowing up right now  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1643) why is it not blowing up because  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1645) whatever is keeping it together now has  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1647) kept it together a second ago and we'll  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1648) keep it together a second from now  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1651) hope it doesn't blow up in my face  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1653) you know but you see the point so this  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1655) is the stability and predictability of  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1657) science and if we didn't believe in that  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1659) and we didn't have that as somewhat of  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1660) an axiom before even doing science  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1663) then we couldn't do science  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1666) so instead of using the universal  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1667) constants  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1669) and and uh using uh  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1672) science really physics to make the  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1674) argument you can still make the same  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1675) argument you can still say  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1678) you can still say the universe  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1682) it's a fact that the universe permits  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1684) life  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1687) it is a fact that the universe permits  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1689) life it is a fact that the universe is  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1691) stable  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1692) predictable uniform  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1696) and simply ask  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1697) what is the best explanation for this  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1700) that's how easy it is  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1705) and you know because  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1707) going into probability discussion might  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1709) be  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1710) disadvantageous  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1713) and  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1714) you go into a probability discussion  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1715) you're putting the null hypothesis  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1716) chance  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1717) zero or whatever it is but that zero is  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1719) impossible we don't even concede to that  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1723) so  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1724) for that reason  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1726) i don't i don't like using this argument  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1728) in this way unless you use it strictly  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1731) as a supporting evidence  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1732) strictly  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1733) if you use supporting evidence i don't  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1735) think it's that bad but using it as a  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1737) main type of argument which some people  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1738) do  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1740) what if what if the people's martin rhys  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1742) changes his mind he writes the book says  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1745) six numbers and then he changes his mind  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1746) says actually the electromagnetic  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1748) thing is this and then  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1750) is he he can't change his mind they  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1752) can't change their mind they do change  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1753) their mind  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1754) these physicists change their mind  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1755) within one's own lifetime  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1758) so to pick one's hopes  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1760) uh on on on these theories  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1763) is is difficult  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1766) and we have to go more fundamental than  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1767) this which is why is there something  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1768) rather than nothing in the first place  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1771) okay and this goes back  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1774) what is the epistemic probability that  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1776) there may be something rather than  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1778) nothing  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1779) and the epistemic probability  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1781) or on an atheistic world views nothing  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1783) zero is is  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1785) uh  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1786) zero  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1788) you see the point  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1790) what is the epistemic probability that  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1792) there can be something rather than  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1793) nothing  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1795) considering an atheistic worldview  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1797) yes that you know  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1799) there is no possibility of that  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1800) happening  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1801) so we don't need to go into elaborative  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1804) dice type  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1808) illustrations  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1811) and we talked about the assumption of  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1812) necessity and sometimes you can have a  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1813) necessity and it doesn't threaten  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1816) god's thesis  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1820) now there are some objections to this  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1822) kind of  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1823) fine-tuning argument  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1827) i've written them down i mean you can  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1828) look at them yourself  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1830) but all three of them do not apply  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1832) to the way that the argument is made  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1836) if you  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1837) simply even don't even make it as an  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1840) argument simply ask a question  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1844) why is the universe stable  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1846) why does  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1847) what explanation do you have you don't  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1849) even need to have why what explanation  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1852) do you have for the universe  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1854) permitting life  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1855) being stable being uniform being regular  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1859) i have no explanation  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1861) what explanation fits this data best  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1865) the fact that the universe is is this  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1867) way what explanation fits this data best  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1869) the less you say i think the more  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1870) powerful it is the more you bring in  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1872) ideas of probability and epistemic  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1875) versus bayesian bayesian actually  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1876) bayesian is a type of epistemic  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1878) objective  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1879) probability  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1880) but  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1881) bayesian versus total or statistical  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1883) probability  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1885) and you have to now have a mathematical  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1887) discussion when they say there's a 20  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1890) chance  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1891) for example that  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1893) or 50 chance that someone's going to die  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1894) from cancer  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1896) according to cancer research that is  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1898) actually  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1899) that is actually the stat  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1901) i'm not sure if you know that  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1903) 50 of people in the uk die from cancer  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1906) or 50 of people die from cancer  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1909) do you know that according to the cancer  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1911) research one in two  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1913) now obviously the majority of them are  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1914) over the age of 60 yeah but that's still  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1916) that's called a statistical probability  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1919) the way they come to that conclusion is  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1921) basically by seeing how many people die  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1922) from cancer and divide it and ratio it  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1926) but a statistical possibility is not to  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1928) say probability is not the same  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1930) as an epistemic probability and or  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1933) uh  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1934) or an inductive is referred to as an  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1936) inductive  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1937) or or  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1939) a bayesian probability  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1941) so you  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1942) but this is is getting once again  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1945) imagine just being a debate or a  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1946) discussion with some kind of a  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1947) mathematician  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1948) and you now have to define why you're  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1950) using what probability  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1952) you can imagine it even very sticky  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1954) so instead of doing all of that just say  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1956) okay  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1957) what we what we can all agree upon is  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1959) that there's something rather than  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1960) nothing these are the agreeables  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1962) do we agree that there's something  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1963) rather than nothing number one  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1965) we agree that the universe is stable  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1967) predictable and uniform  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1970) we agree that the universe  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1971) has a life permitting range  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1974) now what's what  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1977) explains this data best  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1980) does explaining this data best  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1983) if he says chance if they say chance if  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1985) they say that to you because you're not  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1986) going to say it's either chance because  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1987) it cannot be chance  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1989) if they say it's chance yes it's chance  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1991) it's the burden of proof is the one upon  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1992) the one that's making the claim you're  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1993) making what is chance explain it and  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1995) explain how that consider how that can  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1998) uh  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=1999) explain the data now they are actually  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2002) it's upon them if they say that  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2005) to explain it it's the burden of proof  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2006) on them you don't have to say it can't  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2007) be chance why are you starting why are  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2009) you fighting their battle for them let  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2010) them do it  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2012) if they say it's uh  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2014) it's uh necessities okay how does  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2016) necessity threaten the fact that there's  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2018) a well necessity in what sense  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2021) so it's all determined like in the  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2022) deterministic sense and then we go back  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2024) to the idea that  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2026) if there is an uninterrupted line of  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2028) causal chains where does it end  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2030) do you have an  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2031) infinite regress  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2034) so they're stuck  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2036) because there is no way of explaining  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2041) the  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2043) the things i've just mentioned  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2045) the stability the the regularity the  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2047) uniformity  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2049) the life permitting  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2051) reality of the universe and or even that  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2053) the universe is there in the first place  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2056) and there's something other than nothing  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2057) you can't that's it you explain it  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2060) explain it we don't know you're going to  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2062) get this answer all the time  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2066) we don't know i don't know  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2069) i don't know  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2071) say what  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2072) is it reasonable  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2074) to assume  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2076) that the laws were put in place by a  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2077) lawmaker  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2079) which laws are you talking about  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2080) the natural laws or the laws of not  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2083) electromagnetic or this we're talking  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2086) about  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2087) these assumptions which are the  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2090) the predictability the uniformity and  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2091) stability of nature those themselves  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2093) were put for they were put in place  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2096) by an intelligent  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2098) intelligence or knowledge  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2101) or something that has knowledge  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2103) or something that has no knowledge  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2106) we know that these patterns exist  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2108) either these patterns exist  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2110) or were put in place by something that  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2112) has knowledge  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2114) or  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2115) or not so which of the two  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2117) and if it's the latter then explain it  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2119) please  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2122) because and this goes back to  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2124) what some say is weak but i don't think  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2125) is that we intuitively we don't we don't  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2128) act like that  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2129) we see something which is  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2132) going back to if you like the the  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2134) watchmaker thing  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2135) we see something with that kind of  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2136) design and we assume assume that some  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2139) something has made it with that that has  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2141) intelligence  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2142) that's what we assume all the time  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2146) but they have to be counter-intuitive in  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2148) order to come to their conclusions  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2150) but  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2151) and i think this is in many ways  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2153) the way that if you look at the quran  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2154) how it makes these kinds of arguments  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2159) that this is the  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2161) manufacturing of allah like the universe  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2164) yeah or the the actually  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2166) he was talking about the mountains and  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2168) the earth and then he says  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2171) the manufacturing of allah that he has  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2174) perfected  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2175) everything  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2177) and when he says he'll  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2179) do you see any gaps in creation  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2181) so if you look at the way allah deals  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2183) with that it's usually informatively and  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2187) interrogatively  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2190) he doesn't do it in a way that is  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2192) eliminatively  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2194) when it came to the um  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2196) that was elimination but when it came to  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2198) this the best way to to count i think to  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2201) do with it is actually ask them  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2202) questions  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2203) sometimes the best arguments are made  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2206) or the best points are made through  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2208) questions rather than so you tell them  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2210) what it is  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2212) you tell them what's happened what is  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2213) what do we have here we have a universe  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2215) with regularity with stability and  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2216) uniformity  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2218) which is life permitting  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2220) we have laws or these patterns of nature  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2224) either they're explained through  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2226) something that puts laws into place an  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2228) intelligence or it's not  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2230) if it's not can you give us an  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2231) alternative  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2232) if they say multiverse and all these  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2234) kind of things is assigned the point  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2236) because  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2236) the multiverse needs an explanation just  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2238) like  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2239) as we've said before just like the  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2240) universe does  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2242) you see it needs an explanation just  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2244) like the universe does and it probably  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2246) needs more of an explanation  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2249) so with that we conclude  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2251) we're going to talk now i know i've been  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2252) speaking for a long time but we're going  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2254) to try these uh  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2256) dish discussions now  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2258) assalamu alaikum  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/lkGjBAP7smc?t=2285) you
