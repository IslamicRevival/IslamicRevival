### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=0) - [00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=3300)

Mohammed Hijab discusses the issue of apostasy in Islam and how it is handled. He argues that there is more than one option for how to handle apostasy, and that the majority of scholars believe that it is acceptable to execute an apostate.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=0)** argues that liberal principles allow for punishments which can be implemented or waived in a contractarian form of liberalism.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=300)**  Mohammed Hijab explains that Thomas Hobbes' idea of the state of nature is a hypothetical condition that would result in humans fighting each other. Hobbes believed that this would be the natural state of mankind, but John Locke and others disagreed. Today, most countries have a form of contractarianism, which means that citizens have certain rights and obligations in exchange for security. When an individual becomes a citizen of a country, they are automatically granted certain rights and obligations.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=600)** Shubuhat Series #2 - "Riddah" (Apostasy In Islam) | Mohammed Hijab covers the different ways in which a person can be punished in a social contract in the United Kingdom, including deprivation of citizenship.
*   **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=900)** Mohammed Hijab discusses the problems with liberalism and its principles, which allow for punishments such as death for those who apostate from Islam. He argues that this is self-defeating because there is no government that is anarchical right now, and every liberal government self-proclaimed liberal government in the world has a contract theory.
*   **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=1200)** The United States Constitution includes an article on treason, which states that treason against the United States consists only of waging war against them or adhering to their enemies. This is in contrast to the Islamic concept of riddah, which requires apostasy from Islam. This concept is discussed in the video, and it is argued that, in a liberal democracy, treason would be considered a legislative matter, rather than a criminal one.
*   \**[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=1500)* Discusses apostasy in Islam and its legal implications. Mohammed Hijab argues that, even if a Muslim woman converts to another religion, she remains a "combatant" under Islamic law and is therefore not eligible for protection under the social contract theory of government.
*   **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=1800)** is a discussion of the issue of apostasy in Islam, with a focus on the differing opinions of different Sunni Muslim scholars on the matter. One of the teachers the speaker studied under argues that a female apostate is not killed the same way as a male apostate, and therefore she is not considered an apostate. argues that this opinion is based on a single, non-representative opinion, and that it is not acceptable in Islamic discourse.
*   **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=2100)**  Mohammed Hijab discusses the possible conditions for an apostate to be sent over to a Muslim nation, and the different opinions among Islamic scholars. He argues that there is more than one option for how to handle apostasy, and that the majority of scholars believe that it is acceptable to execute an apostate.
*   **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=2400)**  Shubuhat discusses apostasy in Islam and how it is handled. He points to the Ottoman Empire as an example of a Muslim government that has well-kept records of apostates. There was a civil war in the Ottoman Empire in 1839, and Shubuhat compares this to the American Civil War 10 years later. He explains that because apostasy is a Muslim issue, it was a Muslim issue that the Ottoman Empire took into account when releasing the apostate woman.
*   **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=2700)**  Mohammed Hijab discusses the differences between the two cases of treason in American history: the case of William Mumford, who was hanged for waving the Confederate flag in Union territory, and the case of Adolph Hitler, who was tried, convicted, and executed for treason for leading Nazi Germany during World War II. He points out that the implementation of laws in each case was a result of the amendment of the United States Constitution, which was passed in the midst of the Civil War.
*   \**[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=3000)* Discusses the various arguments liberals might make against Islam, and how the framework of liberalism does not allow for treasonous acts against one's country to go unpunished. He also compares this to the situation of a Turkish woman who was accused of treason for raising a flag against her country.
*   \**[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShR19UbTSSE\&t=3300)* Discusses the hypocrisy of those who oppose shubuhat (apostasy) punishment in Islam, noting that it is self-defeating and fruitless.

[0:00:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=7) welcome to another session where we are\
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=9) responding to some of the major hats\
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=11) relating to\
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=13) the religion of islam some major doubts\
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=14) questions misconceptions that people\
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=16) have and today we're going to be talking\
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=18) about the ridder laws\
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=21) and\
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=21) really today's discussion is going to be\
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=23) based around my own research\
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=25) which was the subject of one of my\
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=28) dissertations actually for one of my\
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=29) master's degrees in 2019\
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=32) and i'm going to actually read and which\
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=34) have actually made into a small book\
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=36) which you can get\
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=37) online on amazon the treaties\
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=40) of\
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=41) treaties\
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=43) on liberal critiques of radha\
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=46) so i'm going to read out what the basic\
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=48) to jump straight into it the basic\
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=50) argument that i make\
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=52) is\
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=53) some of the novel you know contributions\
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=55) i hope to have been able to make\
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=57) are and they will have a discussion uh\
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=59) thereafter\
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=60) so i've written the very introduction of\
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=62) the um\
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=64) of that particular book that i'm going\
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=66) to read out what i said so i am writing\
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=67) this treatise not to defend\
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=70) islamic penal laws but mainly to show\
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=71) that our current critique of islam is a\
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=74) poor one\
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=76) so below the summary of my argument\
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=80) point number one liberals seek to\
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=82) critique islam's penal laws especially\
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=84) the law of redder\
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=86) because of its non-conformity with\
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=88) modern human rights legislation now\
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=90) we've already covered\
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=91) uh modern human rights legislation\
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=94) the obvious\
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=96) thing that people say about that is that\
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=97) well\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=98) if you punish someone for changing their\
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=101) religion this is something which goes\
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=102) against human rights\
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=105) and this is number two islamist\
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=107) punishment for it that can be\
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=108) implemented or waived depending on the\
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=110) context\
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=111) obviously i give the examples of that in\
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=113) this\
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=115) in this small booklet but also that this\
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=118) is something within the islamic\
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=119) penal code but of course the shikhasai\
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=122) can correct us if anything that i have\
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=124) said is incorrect i'm actually happy\
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=126) that the sheikh is here because now the\
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=128) things can be checked on two different\
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=130) levels\
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=132) number three liberal principles assuming\
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=134) a contractarian form of liberalism\
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=136) theoretically allow for punishments\
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=138) which can be implemented or waived\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=140) identical to those punish those\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=144) punishing read that so this is all i've\
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=146) sent this to you guys in the group by\
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=147) the way so i can send you these you\
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=149) don't need to write every single point\
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=151) but i'm just letting you know the line\
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=152) of argumentation\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=155) so let me just revise what we've just\
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=156) said already before we continue\
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=159) number one we say that liberals cr\
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=161) seek to critique islam's pedal codes\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=164) especially the law of\
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=165) because of its non-conformity\
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=168) with modern human rights\
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=169) number two islam's punishment for it\
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=172) that can can be implemented and it can\
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=174) be waived\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=176) depending on the context\
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=179) number three liberal principles which\
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=181) we've already discussed in this class\
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=182) before in the londoner series talking\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=185) about\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=185) contractarianism\
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=187) assuming a contractarian form of\
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=189) liberalism theoretically allow for\
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=191) punishments\
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=193) which can be implemented a way of\
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=194) identical to those\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=196) of\
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=197) in other words the argument is\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=200) that the laws or the punishments of\
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=204) can be implemented in their liberal\
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=206) state\
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=208) in a contractarian form of liberalism\
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=211) which by the way is the only kind of\
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=213) liberalism which has been\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=215) implemented contemporaneously or\
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=217) historically there's no other kind of\
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=219) liberalism which has ever been\
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=222) manifested in the political sphere only\
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=225) a contractarian form\
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=226) and just to remind myself and others\
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=229) who am i uh\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=230) who knows what do we mean by a\
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=232) contractarian form of liberalism\
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=235) one particular what are the main salient\
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=237) features of a contract heavy inform\
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=238) before we continue\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=240) is it thomas hobbs why he introduced\
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=243) that basically if we didn't have um\
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=246) contracts um there will be disorder\
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=248) thereby they'll be anarchy and people\
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=250) will have the freedom to do whatever\
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=251) they like however that will come at the\
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=253) cost of\
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=254) basically you know being robbed killed\
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=257) so if we have some kind of a form of\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=259) contract um you have you're going to\
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=261) some kind of agreement so you're letting\
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=262) go of some of your rights\
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=264) for a\
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=266) greater purpose or a great\
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=268) look like the government giving the um\
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=270) um\
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=272) i don't i can't remember it but what i\
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=273) know is basically let go of some of your\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=274) rights for uh bigger objectives does\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=277) anyone want to ask that you're\
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=278) definitely on the right tracks i mean\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=279) it's not anything necessarily wrong in\
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=281) what he said at all is anything else\
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=283) that one wants to add on this point of\
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=285) contractarianism\
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=288) subjects in a state\
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=290) have indirectly accepted that\
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=293) a\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=294) certain group of people who will have\
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=295) authority over them so they've given up\
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=297) freedom for for in return for safety or\
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=299) security perfect that's that's well\
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=301) phrased this is exactly what we're\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=302) looking for\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=304) um what you were saying was actually\
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=305) correct as well because the idea really\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=307) is\
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=308) what thomas hobbs in the levithan he\
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=310) mentioned he wrote a book called\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=311) right\
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=312) and he he mentioned something called the\
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=314) state of nature we discussed this\
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=316) and it was a hypothetical say it wasn't\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=317) an actual state so it wasn't a state\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=319) which actually took place in the real\
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=320) world\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=321) a hypothetical state means a state which\
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=323) is fictitious it's\
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=325) an idea in someone's mind\
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=327) it's not based on real events\
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=330) okay so what thomas hobson was saying is\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=332) that basically if we take the idea\
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=335) that human beings will be left free to\
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=337) do whatever they want to do he had it\
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=339) all against all mentality he thought\
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=341) everyone would fight each other that's\
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=342) what would happen\
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=343) uh by the way this is depicted in a book\
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=345) called lord of the flies i'm not sure if\
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=347) anyone has read that book but it was\
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=349) based on um it was based on this either\
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=351) we do in school that's i mean that's why\
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=353) a lot of you may have it we do it in\
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=354) english literature right\
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=356) anyway\
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=358) the idea is that it's um\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=360) you know all against all but that's his\
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=362) idea of contractarianism his idea of\
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=365) sorry the the the\
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=366) state of nature\
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=368) that particular idea is not necessarily\
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=370) shared by all like john locke didn't\
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=372) have the idea that if people were left\
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=373) in the state of nature that they would\
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=374) all fight each other\
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=376) so there was competing liberal ideas of\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=378) what the state of nature is\
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=380) there wasn't one idea of what the state\
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=382) state of nature is john locke had a\
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=384) different idea to thomas hobbes and so\
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=386) on but the point that might have\
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=388) mentioned is the correct one\
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=390) eventually whatever the sale of nature\
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=392) is whether it's all against all whether\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=394) people are collaborating with one\
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=395) another or whatever it may be\
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=397) there's a\
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=399) there is a\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=400) barter if you like\
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=402) there is a barter\
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=404) of of freedom in exchange for security\
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=407) and this is the this is the main point\
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=410) now in the modern day how is this\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=411) manifested\
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=415) because every we said that almost every\
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=417) liberal country\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=419) has is contractarian\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=422) so how is it how does it manifest how\
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=424) how am i a new part of the social\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=426) contract now\
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=427) development\
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=429) yeah but how how\
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=431) citizenship citizenship okay beautiful\
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=434) right\
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=435) so\
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=436) if you have a citizenship in this\
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=437) country that means what\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=440) you have entitlement well you're\
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=442) entitled to some things at the cost of\
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=444) you know obeying the law yeah absolutely\
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=446) perfect right and how ianni what other\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=448) ways of acquiring citizenship i mean\
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=451) what's how did you acquire it\
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=453) me i came to the country when i was one\
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=455) years old\
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=458) tell them the truth how much did you pay\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=459) for it\
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=461) that's a different story\
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=465) what we're talking about is okay someone\
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=467) who who was born here yeah okay\
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=469) i was born here so that's different to\
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=471) someone born to someone um come in here\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=473) because then you need to\
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=474) give it kind of allegiance in that sense\
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=477) yeah yeah because if you're born it's\
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=479) like if you're if i'm mistaken you said\
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=481) if we're born here yeah uh we we're from\
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=483) the get-go yeah and nobody asked us you\
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=485) know do you obey yeah like if you go\
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=486) past the uh there's a camera speed\
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=489) camera and you get fine you can't say oh\
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=490) i didn't agree to this\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=492) from the get-go you have entitlements\
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=494) and you have to obey by to those lords\
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=496) um but if you are someone who seeks\
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=498) asylum here\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=500) then i think it's a bit of a different\
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=501) story it's a different story but\
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=503) philosophically here what's the main\
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=504) difference it's the ones because what's\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=506) born into it what's the word beginning\
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=508) with c\
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=509) t\
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=511) well the opposite of\
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=514) concern concern\
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=515) yeah okay\
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=516) so in one case there is what and what\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=518) other case there isn't so in one case\
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=520) okay so um\
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=522) you are being coerced when you're born\
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=524) uh and when you uh seek asylum you are\
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=527) consenting yeah okay it's not just\
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=528) taking asylum you can get visa through\
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=530) different and i know that i know\
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=539) because we are forced into us i was\
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=541) forced into a social contract this is\
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=542) very interesting and important\
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=544) the different diff the the difference\
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=546) between an islamic social contract\
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=548) sometimes\
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=550) there are similarities you can be forced\
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=551) into islamic social contracts as well\
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=552) like if you're both parents are muslim\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=557) you're muslim as well that's as simple\
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=558) as that really\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=559) you know so you can be forced into\
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=561) social car otherwise you'd have what\
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=563) disorder but if you become a muslim it's\
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=565) kind of like acquiring citizenship\
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=568) now\
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=569) the reason why this is important is\
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=570) because\
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=572) actually there is\
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=574) people look at these matters in a very\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=575) secular manner so they look at these\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=577) matters these masters but islam is is\
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=579) not a secular system so it could it\
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=581) conflates\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=583) religion\
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=584) and politics it's both together there's\
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=587) no conflict there's no separation\
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=588) between church and state which means\
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=590) that when you are a muslim now you have\
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=592) and especially if you have given baya\
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=594) which is additional thing if you've\
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=596) given a pledge of allegiance\
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=598) then now you are not only a\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=600) fully-fledged citizen but anything you\
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=602) do or saying may be held against you and\
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=603) called look quite literally like\
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=605) you know so\
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=606) this is what we mean by contractarian is\
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=608) a very important thing okay because\
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=609) contractarianism is the idea that you\
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=611) are in a contract now a social contract\
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=614) and\
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=615) the the head\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=616) of government is\
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=619) who in this country\
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=621) now is the prime minister okay is the\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=623) prime minister the queen has a\
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=624) ceremonial role\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=625) ever since charles ii i mean\
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=628) parliament became sovereign so the queen\
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=630) is no longer\
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=632) you know she she she has a ceremonial\
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=635) role but she's no longer sovereign in\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=637) that sense ever since in the 1500s and\
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=639) so on that there was there was a\
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=641) movement in this country the queen\
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=642) actually had power\
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=644) you know the last time the queen\
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=645) actually tried to veto her law because\
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=646) she can technically veto her law was uh\
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=648) queen victoria i think it was\
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=650) and she was out she was uh you know\
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=653) overruled or something like that so\
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=655) uh the queen is the head of the church\
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=657) of england and all the kind of yeah this\
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=658) is all ceremonial stuff it doesn't\
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=660) really have any legislative implications\
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=663) uh in terms of um\
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=665) this country there's three types of law\
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=668) in the uk\
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=669) there's a constitutional law there is by\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=671) the way a british constitution\
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=674) just because it's not codified it\
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=675) doesn't mean it doesn't exist there is a\
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=677) british constitution\
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=679) and there is statute law and then there\
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=681) is a\
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=682) in in course they use case law as well\
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=683) you know there's common law\
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=686) but the constitutional law is fragmented\
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=689) and it's uncodified\
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=691) in this country so there is a\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=692) constitution in this country\
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=693) it's fragmented and it's uncodified i\
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=695) mean it's not written in one place\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=698) in america it's codified and it's\
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=700) centralized\
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=701) so it's all in one place\
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=703) and it's not fragmented\
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=704) but you should be aware of these things\
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=706) because obviously we live in this\
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=708) country we have to know\
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=709) how the system works\
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=713) so parliament is sovereign meaning\
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=714) parliament\
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=717) uh gets to make the rules and decisions\
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=719) uh in this case it's the house\
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=721) of commons\
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=722) obviously the house of lords\
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=724) it kind of uh\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=726) it ratifies or whatever the the the laws\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=729) but it's not created law creation is\
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=732) happening in the house of commons with\
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=734) the 650 odd i think\
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=736) seats\
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=738) but really those who make the laws\
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=740) are not are not the backbench mps\
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=743) they are the\
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=744) the cabinet if you like the government\
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=746) although technically it's possible for\
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=747) someone to who is a backbench mp to\
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=750) write down something called white paper\
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=751) and get it done but for the most part\
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=754) law creation is done by the cabinet and\
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=755) the government the executive\
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=757) anyway so this is uh\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=759) how it works and in all liberal\
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=762) countries therefore there is a contract\
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=764) that you have\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=765) and you have to obey the law\
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=767) and if especially if you're a citizen\
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=771) and obviously with that there comes\
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=772) privileges\
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=775) um\
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=776) and\
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=777) we should mention actually there's\
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=778) recently a builder or maybe we should\
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=779) put it's called the national\
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=781) what's it called the national borders\
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=782) bill that's how it's called nationality\
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=784) national label right\
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=787) nationally and borders built yeah this\
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=789) is a a recent bill like literally like\
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=791) we're talking patel literally wants to\
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=793) put this on\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=794) yanny the last two two weeks or three\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=796) weeks ago\
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=798) which is um trying to expand the scope\
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=799) of deprivation of citizenship for people\
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=802) that are basically like dual nationals\
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=804) or whatever\
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=805) uh\
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=806) which is that if any if anyone some if\
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=808) someone does something which is\
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=811) in quote-unquote against the public good\
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=813) then they can have their citizenship\
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=815) deprived\
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=816) and this law hasn't made it through yet\
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=818) and it's been obviously challenged now\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=819) not just by muslims by the way but it's\
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=821) being challenged by the lgbt uh groups\
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=824) the black community\
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=825) you know a lot of people are challenging\
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=827) this group because they're seeing as\
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=828) racist because it's going to\
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=829) disproportionately affect\
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=831) ethnic minorities but these are the\
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=832) problems with citizenship\
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=835) you can even be stripped of your\
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=836) citizenship on grounds as flimsy as the\
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=838) public with very broad\
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=840) grounds\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=842) obviously deprivation of citizenship\
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=844) which is\
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=846) what happens when people think\
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=848) it's called deprivation when they take\
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=849) your citizenship away from you\
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=852) this is very very very rare\
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=854) i mean\
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=855) considering the history of britain\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=856) considering the amount of people that\
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=858) lived in it\
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=859) it's there have been few few cases i\
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=861) mean considering the population\
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=863) of actual deprivation and taking away\
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=865) your citizenship and they have to\
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=867) to to do something pretty heavy for that\
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=869) to be the case however as we'll come to\
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=872) deprivation of citizenship which is a\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=874) very\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=874) harsh measure is not the only way for\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=876) you to be\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=878) to be\
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=879) punished in a social contract\
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=882) in this country they have trees and laws\
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=884) for a very long time\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=885) uh laws of treachery and treason and\
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=888) they still do in a sense but in a\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=890) different guys\
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=891) through uh\
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=894) discussion about terrorism and\
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=896) which which which is inherently\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=898) discriminatory which is anti-liberal by\
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=900) the way which is something we can come\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=901) to because liberalism says everyone\
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=903) should be equal but these laws that\
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=904) they're putting in place\
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=906) is inherently favoring some communities\
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=909) over others\
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=910) so already the social contract is not in\
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=912) accordance with the principles led down\
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=914) we have issues here now\
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=915) because according to liberalism everyone\
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=917) should be the same\
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=918) but the laws that i've been putting in\
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=920) place now\
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=921) are discriminatory to one group over\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=923) another so you can even argue within\
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=924) liberal paradigm that the laws have been\
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=927) put in place now are\
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=928) clearly\
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=929) like the patriots act in america in\
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=931) america and you know these kinds of\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=932) terrorist acts prevent all these kind of\
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=934) things\
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=935) within the liberal paradigm you can make\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=936) strong arguments against this stuff\
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=938) but anyway this is just a kind of a\
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=940) tangent number four i just want to\
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=942) revise the three points i just made yeah\
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=944) the first point we made is liberal seek\
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=945) to critique islam's penal laws\
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=947) especially the law of religion because\
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=949) of its non-conformity with modern humans\
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=950) right new modern human rights\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=952) legislation number two islam's\
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=954) punishment for it that can be\
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=955) implemented away depending on the\
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=956) context number three liberal principles\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=959) assume a contractarian form of\
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=960) liberalism theoretically allow for\
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=962) punishments which can be implemented or\
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=963) waved identical to those\
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=965) uh punishments of of lydia\
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=969) uh number four\
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=971) historically liberal governments have\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=973) applied laws that are identical to the\
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=976) laws of regarding rudder so now it's\
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=978) moved away from being an abstract\
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=981) case we're saying actually in in history\
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=983) this has shown to be the case\
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=987) number five invoking non-contract terror\
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=989) and liberalism is not an adequate\
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=990) defense we've explained why because\
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=992) non-contractarian anarchical types of\
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=994) liberalism simply don't exist in the\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=996) world that we live\
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=997) there is no government which is\
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=998) anarchical right now\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1000) every liberal government self-proclaimed\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1003) liberal government in the world\
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1006) has a contract theory every single one\
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1008) there's no country that i know of\
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1010) that it says i'm liberal\
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1012) or puts that in his founding father\
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1014) documents or constitution or whatever\
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1017) and it's not contractarian at the same\
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1018) time\
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1019) therefore liberal critiques of\
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1020) liberalism\
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1022) of islam are self-defeating that's\
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1024) basically the crux\
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1026) of the discussion okay\
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1029) now we have already discussed\
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1031) in previous and we can obviously\
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1034) we can go to\
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1036) some of the things that we've spoken\
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1038) about before in the london era as to\
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1041) that because we can we can quote john\
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1042) locke we have before and i can quote him\
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1044) again right now i mean i've got him in\
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1045) this book\
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1046) we can quote john locke we can call\
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1048) other people\
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1049) about how\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1051) uh he he thinks himself john locke the\
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1054) founding father of liberalism that you\
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1056) can't even have an apostasy law\
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1059) and that's not against liberalism we've\
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1062) made this quotation before we can make\
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1063) this quotation\
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1064) uh again\
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1066) but the problem is\
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1070) uh the issue is not this the issue is\
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1073) so i'm trying to get rotation\
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1075) the issue is\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1078) i mean look in fact let's let's make a\
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1079) few quotations let me let me read the\
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1081) john locke quotation once again i think\
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1083) it's it's worth reading\
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1085) john locke mentions\
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1089) the first is of those who being\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1091) initiated the mosaical rights and made\
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1093) citizens of that commonwealth did after\
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1096) afterwards apostasized from the worship\
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1098) of god of israel\
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1100) these were\
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1101) preceded against the traitors and rebels\
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1103) guilty of no less than high treason\
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1105) for the commonwealth of jews different\
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1107) in that from all others was an absolute\
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1110) theocracy\
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1111) nor was there or could there be any\
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1113) difference between that commonwealth and\
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1114) the church\
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1116) so he's he's basically indicating here\
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1119) very clearly that those who apostated\
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1122) from the religion of judaism\
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1124) they are guilty of no less than high\
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1126) treason\
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1128) clearly in that in that case then the\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1129) death penalty would be very easily\
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1132) sanctionable\
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1133) because treason was punishable by death\
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1135) almost everywhere in the world\
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1138) look at what emmanuel kapp mentions he\
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1140) says there cannot be even uh cannot even\
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1142) be an article contained in the political\
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1144) constitution constitution that would\
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1146) make it possible for a power in the\
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1148) state in the case of transgressions of\
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1149) the constitutional laws by the supreme\
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1151) authority to resist or\
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1153) even restrict in so doing\
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1156) so he's saying basically when the\
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1158) contract is put in place you cannot\
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1160) resist it you ca you cannot go against\
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1162) it\
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1164) these kinds of\
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1165) in a nutshell i mean you could say these\
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1167) kinds of arguments in general mean\
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1171) that\
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1173) meanwhile\
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1174) they mean that\
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1176) the framework of liberalism and this is\
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1179) it's very important to get us right not\
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1180) that\
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1181) liberal thinkers said xyz no the\
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1183) framework of the usual the principles\
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1185) the\
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1186) kawaii the\
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1187) you know principles of liberalism itself\
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1190) they\
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1190) allow\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1192) a treason law which means that if\
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1195) someone goes against it that they can be\
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1197) killed\
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1200) look at what it says in the united\
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1202) states constitution i'm going to read\
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1203) from the constitution now this is the\
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1204) united states constitution\
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1206) which is a liberal document\
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1208) is a liberal document\
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1210) treason against the united states shall\
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1212) consist only in levying war against them\
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1217) or in adhering to their enemies giving\
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1219) them aid and comfort no person shall be\
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1222) convicted of treason unless on the\
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1223) testimony of two witnesses interesting\
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1226) to the same over act or on confession in\
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1230) open court number two the congress shall\
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1232) have power to declare the punishment of\
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1234) treason\
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1235) but the attainder of treason shall work\
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1238) corruption of blood or\
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1240) forfeiture except during the life of the\
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1243) person attained\
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1246) this is uh this is the very famous\
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1250) article three of the united states\
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1251) constitution okay so it does have a\
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1253) treason clause\
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1254) now how that has been used in history\
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1258) now before we before we do so before we\
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1260) get there i think it's important for us\
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1263) to realize\
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1264) uh what we've been saying here let's\
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1266) have a little break and ask the question\
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1268) what's the argument i want someone to\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1270) uh look at the five points i've put in\
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1272) the group as well\
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1274) and uh ask the question what's the\
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1275) argument that is being made\
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1277) and i'll answer one question if someone\
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1279) returns and says well okay immanuel kant\
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1281) said whatever he had to say john locke\
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1282) said whatever he had to say but we don't\
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1284) agree with john locke and we don't agree\
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1286) with emmanuel can\
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1288) are they missing the boat are they\
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1289) missing the argument\
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1291) before we get there we're gonna have a\
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1293) two three minute session here now we're\
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1294) gonna have a two three minute session\
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1296) speak to the person next to you and then\
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1297) we can ask and get the information from\
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1299) everyone else okay\
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1308) so uh basically if we're looking for the\
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1311) before before we get that what did we\
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1313) what did we um say about the two\
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1315) questions that we had in place\
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1318) what are the questions i have first of\
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1319) all remember so uh we were asked um\
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1323) if somebody comes to us and says well\
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1325) you can't say john locke said this and\
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1327) say that john locke is representative of\
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1330) you know liberal contractarianism\
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1333) uh so you saying john locke condones\
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1335) this isn't an argument but our response\
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1337) to that is\
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1338) well we're claiming that uh liberalism's\
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1341) uh underlying uh you know\
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1344) framework suggests this and when you\
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1346) look at people who have implemented uh\
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1350) liberal constitutions like the united\
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1352) states government\
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1354) they have a very clear article in there\
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1356) which uh allows for the death penalty\
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1359) for the act of treason\
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1361) um\
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1363) so yeah okay the death penalty is not\
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1365) necessarily a constitutional matter i\
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1366) think that's a state matter by the way\
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1368) so be careful with that everything else\
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1369) is absolutely fine\
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1372) now the question is how do we know how\
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1374) can we establish\
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1376) um\
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1377) because by the way you know in some\
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1379) states in the in some sense in america\
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1380) the the\
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1382) death the death penalty is applied and\
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1384) some some others they're not\
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1386) so it's a statement but but the question\
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1388) is now\
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1389) how do we establish that\
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1392) it's uh found it's a foundational matter\
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1395) or it's something which is principle\
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1397) to liberalism how can we establish that\
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1402) this is based on social contract theory\
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1404) yeah stem from that so uh\
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1406) basically if they're saying um\
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1408) they disagree with it then they will\
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1410) have to basically disagree with social\
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1411) contractor if they do they basically\
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1413) won't have liberalism good you're right\
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1414) but how would you prove that\
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1416) how would you prove that it's it's a\
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1418) matter of if you reject\
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1420) the fact that a treason or treachery or\
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1422) treason law\
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1424) uh which has the net effect of giving\
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1426) someone a death penalty\
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1427) is equivalent to rejecting the entire\
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1430) social contract how would you prove that\
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1434) how would you prove apostasy similar to\
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1435) this no how would you prove\
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1437) that one is equivalent to the other in\
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1438) other words rejecting treason or\
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1441) whatever is as as if you're rejecting\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1444) the whole social contract here\
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1446) right because uh the idea of treason is\
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1448) basically you're not accepting the\
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1450) social contract theory right uh because\
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1452) uh by the social contract that we mean\
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1454) uh that you have given up uh certain\
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1456) rights uh\
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1458) to the state\
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1460) in exchange for uh security\
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1462) and then basically going against that uh\
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1465) uh\
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1466) that contract that you direct you uh\
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1469) consensually or\
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1471) coercively signed without without your\
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1473) consent signed is basically treason\
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1475) right right okay good so but here's a\
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1477) question it might be a very basic one\
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1480) there's a normal citizen in and we're\
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1482) bringing in another ideology here\
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1483) whether it's direct democracy or\
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1485) actually direct they would act so in a\
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1487) representative democracy format there's\
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1489) a normal citizen okay\
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1492) have legislative capabilities in direct\
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1494) forms they would actually but in in\
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1496) representative\
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1497) democracy would they have it or not\
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1501) so what do i mean by that someone tell\
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1502) me what i mean by what i just said\
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1504) you said legislation uh yes do they have\
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1507) a legislative capability an individual\
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1509) citizen yeah individuals no he wouldn't\
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1511) because it would depend on the people\
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1512) around him right in representative\
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1514) democracy how does a representative\
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1515) democracy work uh because a\
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1517) representative democracy involves uh you\
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1520) know the uh\
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1521) consent of multiple people right you\
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1524) know the choice or preference of uh of a\
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1526) group around you okay and when they\
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1528) become in power and they make laws\
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1531) are you obligated to follow those laws\
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1533) by the social contract yeah\
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1535) right what if you don't want to follow\
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1536) those laws\
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1538) do you have a job yeah there's a\
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1540) punishment for this\
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1541) yeah so it's so does your does your\
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1543) opinion count on the representative\
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1545) framework no\
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1548) okay so you so let's put it let's make\
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1550) it clear\
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1551) if you're born into a country and now\
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1552) you've got a citizenship yeah\
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1554) you've got certain laws\
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1557) now you don't like some of those laws\
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1559) because there's some of them hash\
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1561) like many people in america don't like\
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1562) some of the death penalty laws because\
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1563) some of them are very harsh\
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1565) do you have a right to say well my first\
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1567) amendment rights are my second amendment\
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1568) right so i don't want this or no you\
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1570) don't can you elaborate on that a little\
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1572) bit more you did mention a point\
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1574) reference point i can't remember what\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1576) you did\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1576) i remember you mentioned it that\
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1579) i i can't remember but that they have no\
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1581) right to oppose that yeah they have the\
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1583) right to opposite what did you mean do\
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1584) you can you remember\
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1585) i can't remember what you said yeah you\
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1587) said basically they're kind of opposite\
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1588) well they can't oppose it because why\
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1589) what did you say was\
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1592) because they basically agreed to the\
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1594) contract so\
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1596) they just can't say that um now i choose\
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1598) to opt out of the contract\
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1600) yes\
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1602) you can't have your cake and need both\
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1603) you can't have a citizenship and and\
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1605) decide what\
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1606) what the the representative\
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1608) does\
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1609) because you're not the representative\
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1610) the only way out of that is what you\
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1612) lose the function there's another way\
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1614) out there\
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1614) you just kill yourself\
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1617) you make a new law\
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1619) you run for office\
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1620) that's the only way out there\
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1623) that you become the representative\
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1625) you come strong enough to make laws\
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1628) that's that's how this country works\
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1630) you've got protesting you've got this\
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1631) you can become a part of a trade union\
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1634) you know these these are the the ways\
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1636) that people do it but you cannot just\
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1638) decide but i don't like this load if i'm\
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1640) gonna opt out that one\
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1643) i mean last time like you mentioned\
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1644) there's a three more power speed limit\
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1646) i'm sure you've been given some of those\
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1648) letters at home you've been driving 50\
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1650) miles an hour on a three mile per road\
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1652) you're gonna say well i decided it was\
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1654) morally unacceptable for such road to be\
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1655) 30 miles an hour\
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1658) but it's different how they apply it to\
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1659) someone who's a citizen someone who's\
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1662) become a citizen\
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1664) because they can send them back\
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1666) with the citizens they deal with them\
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1667) differently actually well i mean i think\
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1669) that they're quite consistent here to be\
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1670) honest\
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1672) yeah but they have to\
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1673) the other is fine what they're doing\
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1675) here is normal well if you don't have\
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1677) this you have anarchy no no no we accept\
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1679) it what we're saying is that the way\
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1680) they deal with their citizens the one\
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1682) which is born into it um actually even\
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1684) then he's in trouble his wife is born\
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1685) into it it depends his ethnic background\
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1687) oh yeah you talk about the national\
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1689) building yeah yeah yeah of course so\
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1690) it's like that's yeah that's ridiculous\
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1691) because there's a lot of people being\
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1692) sent back but without the social\
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1693) contract theory what do you have the\
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1695) anarchy we have anarchy\
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1697) you know that's why the people that keep\
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1700) emphasizing individualism individualism\
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1701) individualism or if you have an\
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1703) individualism that's\
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1705) a proper individualism it goes all the\
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1706) way to being an anarchy\
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1708) that's the purest version of\
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1709) individualism and anarchical\
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1711) individualism\
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1713) but if you don't so if you you're gonna\
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1715) have to deal with one or two different\
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1716) kinds of uh\
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1718) fright\
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1719) or scare\
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1721) either you deal with the fright of being\
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1724) uh\
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1725) of being\
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1727) attacked and killed or money being taken\
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1730) away from you from the other people who\
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1732) have no laws to restrict them\
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1734) or you deal with the fight or all the\
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1736) consequences of the government itself\
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1738) and since the latter is more\
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1742) is more consistent in its application of\
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1744) the laws\
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1745) most people want predictability in their\
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1747) lives stability so that's why we have\
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1749) governments\
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1753) anyway\
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1755) uh basically islamically the classically\
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1757) speaking the law of redder has been\
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1759) almost\
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1760) it is\
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1761) actually i don't know of anyone who says\
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1762) anything other than that you know the\
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1764) person who does that in public is\
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1766) is not to be killed in a public space\
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1770) uh this has been the except for what\
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1772) i've seen of the hanafi school when i\
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1773) read a book called um\
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1775) for\
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1777) and he said that he basically said that\
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1779) the female combatants are not included\
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1781) in that\
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1782) because they're not combatants but\
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1783) that's interesting because it indicates\
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1786) that it's because they have a new status\
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1788) now they're happy they're combatants or\
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1789) whatever\
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1790) but here\
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1791) how does that relate to you're talking\
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1792) about a woman a woman apostate no you\
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1795) said combatants yeah they said that it's\
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1797) um she's not a combatant she's not happy\
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1799) she does not become a herbie\
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1801) in any situation she does not become a\
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1803) combatant in any situation also are you\
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1805) saying the illa is that the male can\
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1808) become a combatant that's why he is\
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1809) killed i don't know if it's highlight\
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1810) because if if if i lose tab that's\
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1813) something question another question i\
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1814) have to look into the books again so why\
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1816) are they saying that a female has not\
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1817) become a combatant yeah that that's they\
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1819) are saying she doesn't become a\
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1821) combatant so therefore she's not killed\
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1822) if she comes in a prostate so then\
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1824) doesn't that mean that\
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1825) the apostate is being killed because of\
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1827) the threat that he poses to the state\
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1830) therefore a female is not seen as\
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1832) someone that yeah\
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1834) that can be indicated yeah that's that's\
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1836) sexism\
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1838) now be careful with that kind of wording\
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1840) because uh it's actually um no no\
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1843) they'll say that i'm not saying oh they\
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1844) they would they would say that\
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1846) anything to do\
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1847) if we say a word that seems\
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1850) i think they won't have a problem with\
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1851) that yeah\
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1852) i don't think they don't have a problem\
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1853) with that being seen it like that yeah\
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1855) yeah no but it's you know this is\
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1857) clearly different to muslims\
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1860) men and women but yeah so that's that's\
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1862) the only thing i saw and there's other\
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1863) opinions here and there but like liberal\
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1865) muslims or whatever they don't count\
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1866) some of them are apostates themselves\
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1873) i don't know\
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1874) i haven't seen anything like that i wish\
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1875) i could find that i've heard that as\
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1877) well some people say but i don't know\
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1878) how to share and so you know i saw other\

[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1941) them\
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1942) say\
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1943) uh this uh thing which is except for\
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1945) what i've just mentioned which is\
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1948) which we'll come across in the hanafi's\
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1949) obviously there's going to be more in\
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1951) the handful school let's say if\
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1953) said it but i'm just giving you\
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1956) the only difference of opinion that i\
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1957) have seen in the mother\
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1959) that has been see i should be saying can\
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1961) we imagine that opinion or should we\
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1962) just like because there's so much well\
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1965) look the the method that i employ\
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1967) well now alan you know is that it it's\
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1970) why not it's why not mention that it's\
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1972) not\
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1973) what are we more we are\
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1977) we are people with lay people so we can\
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1979) say this is what the math have to say\
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1981) there's one difference of opinion\
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1982) there's no problem i don't see any\
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1984) problem\
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1985) in uh\
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1986) in that\
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1987) so long as the opinion is is just what\
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1989) even tamiya said in the shechem\
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1991) i'm happy he's here because then he can\
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1993) correct me when i'm when i'm done\
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1995) he's going to tell you to make this this\
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1996) time mistake i'm gonna have to make some\
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=1997) clarifications but uh\
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2000) i had one particular\
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2002) particular teacher his name\
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2007) and uh he was in university\
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2009) teaching me\
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2011) and we were going through malam of ibn\
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2013) taymiyah one time and the way he put it\
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2015) in terms of this\
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2017) opinions and so on as that so long as\
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2018) there's an opinion which has thought it\
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2020) for someone in our mind that i believe\
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2022) in it it's a group of i believe in it\
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2024) then it's\
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2026) something which is seen as acceptable in\
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2028) the islamic discourse so if someone says\
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2029) what about this opinion which says xyz\
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2033) but that opinion does not have backing\
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2035) it doesn't have atari\
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2037) believing in it\
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2039) then\
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2040) then that thing is not acceptable as an\
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2041) opinion it shares there's something\
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2042) which you can put to the side but if a\
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2044) whole school of thought this is a this\
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2046) is one opinion in the school of thought\
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2047) now for the most part of course it can\
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2049) be narrated because this is not it's the\
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2051) whole group of scholars in a school of\
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2052) thought says something and we don't have\
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2054) a right to challenge that and say it's\
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2056) wrong all right unless we are mushtaheds\
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2059) which we are not well unless we have the\
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2060) ability to yani\
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2063) and say this one is right and this one\
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2064) is wrong but we don't have the we don't\
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2066) have the tools for that\
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2071) his opinion of the treaty of debris\
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2073) where does this fit into the israelites\
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2074) so basically look\
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2076) let's bring it what he said right so\
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2078) ibrahimovic\
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2080) and many others like i said something in\
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2081) the group of madawi actually is humbly\
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2084) um\
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2085) who basically talks about the\
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2086) permissibility of drafting a treaty like\
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2088) the tree of hadhibiya\
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2091) and he basically says there's more than\
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2093) one opinion in yani this is allowed now\
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2096) if you remember the treaty of hadibiya\
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2099) those who came to the muslims the ones\
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2102) who were like\
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2104) abu jandal and so on who came and that\
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2106) when they wanted to be rescued\
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2108) they had to be returned\
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2110) so now there's a question the question\
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2112) is\
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2113) can you can you have a treaty\
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2117) with\
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2118) with non-muslim nations\
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2120) where they say for example\
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2122) which would be the opposite of this\
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2124) situation but a smaller shed actually\
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2127) if\
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2127) an apostate is in your land that you\
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2129) send them over to us it's more it's more\
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2130) severe because\
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2132) to\
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2133) to leave off uh a believer coming to the\
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2136) muslims\
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2138) is a big where jib it's a wedge of an\
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2140) islamist worship so the question that\
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2142) brings itself is\
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2146) is a jib for you it would have been\
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2149) where jib\
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2150) to do to do\
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2153) of abuja right but that treaty\
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2156) it stopped our egypt from happening so\
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2158) this shot in the treaty it stopped\
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2160) something which would otherwise be\
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2161) obligatory to happen from happening do\
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2164) you see what i'm saying so what if okay\
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2166) so it's obligatory what's let's say\
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2168) what's the hokum what is the uh\
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2170) uh the ruling\
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2172) of\
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2173) yani uh disposing of the\
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2176) the the the the the\
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2177) the uh the\
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2180) public\
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2181) so we say the classically is the death\
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2183) penalty but if there's a treaty in place\
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2185) would it be\
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2187) a shout or a condition\
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2190) which is an acceptable condition for\
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2192) them to send them over if there's a\
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2194) reason for that for example if it's uh\
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2196) if that nation is weak\
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2206) for example a believer who's coming to\
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2207) you for help to give him the help that\
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2210) he needs if a contract has overrided\
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2212) that yes the lesser of that is for\
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2215) example\
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2216) the capital punishment for the murtaz so\
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2218) if that is allowed how could that not be\
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2220) allowed is that what you're saying yeah\
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2221) we're saying so because this thing that\
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2223) in in in the books of surah they have\
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2225) these issues of like a shelter\
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2228) the kinds of unacceptable\
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2230) unacceptable conditions yeah\
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2232) but it seems and this is why i spoke to\
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2234) some\
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2234) saudi arabia actually yeah let's talk\
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2237) about it afterwards but um they were\
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2238) saying that in in politics the matter is\
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2241) more white because especially if there's\
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2244) like the situation\
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2246) the very famous qaeda principle that the\
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2250) thing which is word\
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2251) also thing which is necessity it makes\
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2253) something which is otherwise not halal\
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2257) so let's put this into action like for\
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2258) example if brunei okay it's a country\
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2260) which is tried to implement islamic\
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2262) laws\
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2263) the question is if they did so what\
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2265) would happen to them they would be\
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2266) economically sanctioned maybe\
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2268) the country itself where the people in\
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2270) it would suffer greatly if they tried to\
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2272) implement this this kind of law\
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2274) so is it legitimate for a country like\
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2276) brunei or not even brunei like sorry to\
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2278) say malaysia or a country which is less\
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2280) weaker and that would be seriously\
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2282) impacted by the\
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2284) the consequences\
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2286) would it be okay for such a country to\
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2288) uh morocco even i think there have been\
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2291) and i said something in the group there\
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2292) was a legenda in morocco of alama that\
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2295) used hadibiya\
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2297) to make this ruling\
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2299) so this i'm not just bringing this out\
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2300) this thing there this ruling is already\
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2302) there there's a legend in morocco that\
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2304) had made this ruling already\
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2305) um\
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2307) would it be okay to say well any\
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2308) apostate will send them over to whatever\
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2310) nation\
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2312) it's possible so what we're saying is\
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2313) it's not the the fact that it has to be\
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2315) this way\
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2316) you know but we're saying that there is\
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2318) there is sa there is some level of\
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2322) movement here in the islamic tradition\
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2325) there is uh\
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2326) there's more than one option and\
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2328) obviously we know that the hadood anyway\
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2330) are not implemented in times of war\
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2332) there's all kinds of like uh you know\
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2334) issues yeah it's like for example in\
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2337) terms of all that i'm not mentioned so\
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2351) is\
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2361) uh maybe it's because the other people\
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2363) will defect to the other side imagine\
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2364) trying to kill somebody and you want\
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2365) them to fight for you\
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2370) you cut their hand off you know you want\
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2372) them to hold the weapon on the sword\
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2373) you're going to cut the hand\
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2374) so which one is it so it's maybe to\
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2376) allah to prevent defection\
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2380) but this is maybe one of the the\
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2381) hekamata i don't know the reason but in\
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2383) terms of warrior for sure\
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2385) so uh this is basically it this is the\
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2387) question\
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2388) now this is the uh if you like the tasil\
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2391) or or the the abstraction\
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2394) the the how can we know what the hawkins\
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2395) according to the motherhood\
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2397) or the if you like the schools of\
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2399) thought the exceptions we can see what\
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2401) the exceptions could be based on the\
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2402) actions of the prophet\
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2404) number three and like the story of\
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2406) gender and\
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2407) how they be and all that kind of thing\
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2409) finally\
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2410) we come to the implementation\
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2413) we come to the implementation\
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2416) so\
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2418) i give an example\
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2420) of the ottoman empire now why did i\
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2422) choose the ottoman empire\
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2424) i chose the ottoman empire because the\
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2426) ottoman empire has the best\
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2428) uh kept records\
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2431) of all the islamic empires that have\
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2432) ever existed the ottoman empire has the\
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2434) best records\
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2436) okay they have uh something called the\
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2438) sejil\
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2440) we we call this a\
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2441) it's a jew as well actually\
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2443) they call it a jewel in turkey maybe you\
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2444) know this\
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2446) i don't know\
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2447) yeah it's\
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2449) what they call it\
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2456) basically it's it's the archive of uh\
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2458) call documents and they're actually um\
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2460) they have\
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2461) now\
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2463) made them electronic copies\
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2465) so we've got we know we have some people\
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2467) in sapiens of course that are fluent in\
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2469) the turkish language i'm not talking\
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2471) about you\
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2474) nobody actually can read the script and\
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2476) they but before they had the ottoman\
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2478) script so that this was a very\
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2479) specialized script\
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2481) uh and so uh\
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2483) we looked at the we looked at the\
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2484) records now we're not saying just\
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2485) because we looked at the records that\
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2487) that's because there are some gaps in\
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2488) the records there's books written about\
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2490) the gaps in the ottoman records\
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2492) but we looked for a very very long time\
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2494) to see what kind of uh\
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2496) court documents there are and we found\
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2498) this one\
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2501) uh figure one let's just here\
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2504) this person called varva nam okay this\
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2506) is the uh granddad\
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2509) can you i'm not sure if you can see it\
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2510) there it's a very this is the code\
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2511) document it's an official code document\
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2512) right here we can see it here what's it\
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2514) called\
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2516) this is jill yeah\
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2518) s i j j\
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2519) il okay uh but it's all in the book so\
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2521) you can you can find this information\
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2522) it's not a problem but can you see here\
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2524) they've got the um this is what it looks\
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2526) like a court document that's what the\
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2528) document looks like right\
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2530) now i i wanted to\
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2532) to look at a time\
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2535) because the idea was i was going to look\
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2537) at this this document and compare it\
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2539) with the american equivalent\
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2541) at the same time\
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2542) because this is 1839 okay so\
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2545) what was going on in 1839 in the ottoman\
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2548) empire\
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2549) there was a civil war in the ottoman\
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2551) empire\
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2552) and the civil war was with the greeks\
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2555) very very famous\
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2556) well-known war\
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2558) but what was happening in america\
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2560) 10 years later\
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2562) or 10-15 years later there was also a\
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2565) civil war the biggest civil war that\
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2567) happened in american history\
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2568) actually the biggest war that happened\
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2569) in america\
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2571) so can you see here and this is what\
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2573) when i was speaking with my supervisor\
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2575) at the time he said this is why it's a\
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2576) very good comparison he said because\
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2578) you're getting this as a like for like\
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2580) comparison\
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2582) for\
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2583) a situation\
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2584) a a a and a lack of like time\
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2587) so it's not like we're going 100 years\
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2589) back and we're talking about 10-year\
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2591) give or take\
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2593) so now we can see we've talked about the\
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2594) principles of liberalism in islam we can\
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2596) see the implementation of it now\
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2598) so look let me read to you what we have\
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2600) actually this is the first time i was\
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2601) trying to translate into english once\
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2603) again now i've sent this phrase many\
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2605) times but this time it's not from from\
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2607) arabic it's from turkish\
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2610) so there's this person called varva nam\
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2612) okay this is the name of the person okay\
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2615) this is my high permission granted\
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2618) and this is not my command of the\
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2619) release\
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2620) for the christian woman known as varva\
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2622) nam has been known to become muslim and\
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2624) later on it came known that she has\
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2626) apostated\
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2627) and was brought to me\
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2629) and later exiled to busra sorry\
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2633) now\
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2634) you are the deputy khadi and you are\
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2636) informed quickly proceed to release the\
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2638) aforementioned woman see how quick clear\
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2640) is\
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2641) so this person apostated\
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2645) then she left the dean\
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2647) and she was released\
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2649) by the hanafi judges so this is a hanafi\
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2651) courts\
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2653) they release her\
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2655) she was a christian woman\
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2657) is it because she was a woman\
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2660) or is it because this was a muslim issue\
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2664) and i think it's the latter\
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2666) it was a muslim issue because\
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2668) they were well aware of what the greeks\
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2670) were doing at that time the greeks were\
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2672) trying to\
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2673) rally their own energize the base and\
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2676) the so therefore they were trying to\
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2678) become muslim and leave islam so that\
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2680) they can get more people to join the\
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2682) resistance against the ottomans\
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2684) but the ottomans were well aware of this\
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2687) and so they were clear and didn't care\
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2689) too much about these apostles the public\
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2691) hypothesis of these people\
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2693) and there's more than these examples but\
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2694) there are only a few examples\
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2698) like this and the whole sigil from\
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2700) why is it the second by this well 15 or\
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2703) whatever it was fifty or seven or the\
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2705) only when he was around\
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2706) so we only have a few examples\
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2709) but when we look at the uh the i the\
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2711) equivalent counter example\
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2714) the case of william mumford okay this is\
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2716) the case of william mumford okay so it's\
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2718) like for that case an american area\
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2720) there's a man called william mumford\
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2724) and he was captured by union forces\
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2726) obviously there was two different groups\
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2728) and the union forces\
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2737) william mumford\
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2739) in 1862 okay\
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2742) this person\
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2745) there were different flags in the civil\
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2747) war the american civil war\
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2748) i'm not sure if you've seen the the two\
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2751) counter american flags you know the one\
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2752) with the confederate flag and the union\
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2754) flag right you've seen how they're\
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2756) different from each other but the\
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2757) situation was such that the flag meant\
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2759) so much and still does by the way in\
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2760) american history\
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2762) but he was he was waving the confederate\
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2764) flag in the union territory in new\
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2765) orleans\
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2767) and as a result what did he do they\
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2768) killed him\
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2769) but what kind of killing was it it was a\
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2771) public\
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2772) hanging\
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2774) it was a public hanging and there was\
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2776) very little resistance\
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2779) in america at that time\
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2781) so what did he do what treason did he\
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2782) commit he raised the wrong flag at the\
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2785) wrong time\
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2787) so this is why this is very important is\
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2789) because number one\
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2791) if you uh if you count up\
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2793) kind of um\
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2796) if you contrast this with the ottoman\
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2798) example the ottoman example they're\
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2800) releasing people the american example\
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2803) they're killing them\
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2804) and this is exactly in the same time\
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2807) and this is based on a treason\
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2809) explanation\
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2810) that the ottomans were\
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2812) who were hanafi's and we explained that\
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2814) they do define these kinds of things as\
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2816) treasonous\
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2817) assad did that\
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2819) and moreover\
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2823) moreover he was he was actually killed\
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2826) by hanging and the way he was hanged it\
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2829) was like you know his neck was cracked\
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2831) and people saw like honestly\
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2834) look look at look what it says i mean i\
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2836) found this newspaper clipping myself\
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2838) 1862 june and 1862. so the new york\
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2841) herald stated rather i'm saying this\
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2844) right we have no lack of excitement\
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2846) today with\
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2847) raising the stars and the stripes in one\
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2848) public building and hanging a man for\
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2851) hauling them down\
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2853) another for holding down another one\
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2857) mumford seemingly protested his\
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2858) innocence i'm saying\
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2860) he's mumford says i never committed an\
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2862) intentional sin in my life\
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2865) and i have\
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2866) and all i have done\
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2867) uh to others i would be have done by and\
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2870) when tomorrow i'm no longer in this\
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2872) world you can say no just and good man\
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2875) as there is in the sea of new orleans\
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2877) has gone numerous so he's trying to play\
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2879) the victim cart i mean he is a victim in\
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2881) many uh people's eyes\
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2883) you know\
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2884) definitely the confederates\
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2888) so\
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2889) then look at look at this look how you\
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2891) look i was killed in front of the people\
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2892) some of the big people were watching\
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2894) this is 150 years ago in america right\
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2896) less than that\
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2897) the fall which was uh this is what the\
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2900) the newer carol said about him\
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2902) the fall which was about four feet\
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2904) dislocated his neck\
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2906) but owing to a slight accident the knot\
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2908) was displaced and worked up his chin\
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2910) leaving his windpipe partially free so\
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2912) because they're hanging him\
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2914) they didn't hang him properly so he was\
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2916) being like\
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2918) like he he was the result was the\
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2920) muscular contraction did not cease for\
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2921) 10 minutes\
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2923) 10 minutes can you imagine this is the\
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2925) problem with hanging someone if you cut\
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2926) his head off sorry to say bianni this\
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2928) would not have happened\
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2930) like if you cut his head off\
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2932) this this situation would not have taken\
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2934) place this is a fact if you shot his\
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2936) head this wouldn't have taken place\
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2939) but because you hanged him\
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2941) then\
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2942) there was no time uh\
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2944) though it was at no time violent\
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2947) according according to this newspaper\
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2949) right\
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2950) and look look at how many people were\
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2952) there this was filled by a crowd of not\
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2954) less than 10 000 people\
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2957) can you imagine they're all there\
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2958) they're all they're cheering and\
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2959) endearing well this is the american\
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2961) culture\
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2962) so we have here a situation which is\
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2964) very clear look at the contrast if you\
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2967) saw both situations and asked people\
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2969) today to see which one is the islamic\
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2971) example and which one is the liberal one\
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2972) i'm pretty sure the mumford example\
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2974) would be seen as the islamic one and the\
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2976) other the\
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2978) will be seen as he\
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2979) would be seen as the liberal one\
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2982) but you see a situation here where the\
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2984) implementation of laws and this is after\
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2986) by the way the amendment of the\
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2988) united states constitution there was 13\
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2990) amendments this is\
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2991) after you know it's 19 this is 1863 so\
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2994) it's in the midst of the civil war but\
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2995) it's near the end of it because the\
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=2997) civil war finished in 1865.\
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3000) and this is after abraham lincoln\
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3003) i mean you've seen abraham lincoln this\
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3004) is abraham lincoln was existed before\
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3006) that and so we're talking about the\
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3007) figures of liberalism and stuff they you\
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3010) know\
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3010) they acquiesce implicated to this\
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3012) reality\
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3013) so um yeah now we have issues the issues\
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3016) are not necessarily\
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3017) uh like this they have extrajudicial\
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3019) killings they have all kinds of\
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3021) implementation type issues\
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3022) and\
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3024) the point we're making is they'll make\
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3025) an argument from contractarianism but\
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3028) what we have seen ladies and gentlemen\
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3029) watching at home is that not only are\
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3032) these arguments unsound abstractly but\
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3035) they are unsound historically as well\
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3037) and contemporaneously and we can\
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3039) obviously open that\
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3040) the can of worms on that so just before\
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3043) we finish\
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3045) but bearing in mind all that we've\
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3047) mentioned\
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3048) you've been a bit quiet\
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3050) yes\
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3051) let's get you involved\
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3052) what are let's start with the first\
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3054) thing\
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3055) what is the first main type of argument\
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3057) if someone who's let's say liberally\
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3058) inclined\
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3060) came and said well your religion allows\
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3061) x y and z\
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3063) how would you in regards to the laws of\
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3065) how would you respond to that\
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3069) the first thing that we'd say\
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3071) yeah i would say you see this\
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3075) okay okay no but let's but this person\
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3077) is a liberal so what do you want to show\
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3078) them that is you want to show them that\
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3080) this is something which is remarkable or\
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3082) something which is unremarkable based on\
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3084) his world view\
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3086) i think i would say yes it does and then\
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3088) i would say\
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3091) this and i would obviously prove\
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3094) why it's not wrong and\
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3097) my argument\
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3099) would have been before this\
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3101) if you go to any islamic country\
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3104) and\
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3105) we know\
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3106) a lot of people\
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3108) that are\
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3109) that are muted\
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3111) or they don't believe or they don't\
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3112) practice so they\
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3113) or they don't follow islam\
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3115) but\
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3117) i never seen a case of someone being\
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3119) hung or someone being killed\
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3121) because of because of not believing\
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3124) and\
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3126) the only the only cases\
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3128) that\
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3129) if you ever were to see\
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3130) would be someone that is openly publicly\
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3133) uh molten and would\
[0:52:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3135) talk would go against islam\
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3139) so\
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3141) if he if we transported our case to a\
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3145) liberal country\
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3146) we have someone that openly goes against\
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3150) the country against the values liberal\
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3152) values\
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3153) and becomes a\
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3155) a danger for for it\
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3156) they will find a way to shut him down\
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3159) i'm with you but\
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3160) look at the examples we've used today\
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3162) with william mumford yeah was he a\
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3163) danger\
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3165) no well i mean was his act let's be very\
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3167) specific to the questioning was his act\
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3169) that he done a dangerous action or was\
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3171) it symbolic action\
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3173) symbolic same what was the action that\
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3174) he done\
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3175) he raised the flag\
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3177) okay and what was the problem with that\
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3179) i think he actually took down the sort\
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3180) of the union flag he took it down yeah\
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3182) he took down the union flag so is that\
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3184) what is that that's creation of a flag\
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3186) yeah just showing that it's not it\
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3188) doesn't agree with maybe\
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3189) whatever the values or whatever china\
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3193) the values of the\
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3194) uh union flag\
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3196) okay and what happened to him\
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3198) so\
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3199) they didn't like the way\
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3200) he expressed although they liked his uh\
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3203) what did they say he was what was he\
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3205) doing he was a\
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3209) and then what they did to him\
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3210) so they killed him they killed him and\
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3212) they did did they do so despite the\
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3214) constitution or because of or\
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3216) following the constitution yeah\
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3218) following the constitution\
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3219) so yeah so what so therefore you don't\
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3222) always have to be a danger to the state\
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3224) in order to be killed for treason\
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3227) okay\
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3228) you see do you see the point it can\
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3229) result in a symbolic action\
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3231) which they see\
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3233) as\
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3234) unacceptable and that has happened\
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3237) but now the question is does the\
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3238) framework allow does the liberal\
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3239) framework allow that\
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3242) what do you think about that\
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3244) and how do we know that it does\
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3246) um because we have the the treason laws\
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3249) in those various countries\
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3252) and we have examples of people being\
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3254) killed\
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3255) because of treason\
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3257) and uh if you compare that with the amer\
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3260) with the islamic as we did with the\
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3263) turkish lady\
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3264) we can see that there's more we have\
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3267) examples of leniency\
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3269) we have the same\
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3271) uh same issue with you know we have the\
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3274) treason\
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3275) it would be comparison with the treason\
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3277) law\
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3278) but we have examples of people being\
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3281) actually\
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3282) um\
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3284) you know they weren't prosecuted\
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3286) excellent so it's conceivable that\
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3289) someone can be prosecuted and it's\
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3291) conceivable that they'll that the\
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3292) punishment will be waived\
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3294) is that conceivability a liberal\
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3296) conceivability or is it also an islamic\
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3298) one\
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3300) both\
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3301) so since it's both the liberal\
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3303) conceivability in the and an islamic one\
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3306) what does that make a liberal argument\
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3307) against this type of punishment\
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3311) hypocrisy hypocritical it's uh fruitless\
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3313) it's self-defeating\
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3316) hopefully everyone understands that but\
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3317) if if you\
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3318) want to go back to the argument it's in\
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3320) the very first page in this first page\
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3322) or one of the first pages\
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3324) second page or third page\
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3326) of the\
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3327) uh of the little book i've sent it in\
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3328) the group as well guys uh that will be\
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/ShR19UbTSSE?t=3330) it for\
