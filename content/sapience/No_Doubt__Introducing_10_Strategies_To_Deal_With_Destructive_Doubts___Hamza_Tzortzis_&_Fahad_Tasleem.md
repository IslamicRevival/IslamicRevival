[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=63) alhamdulillah we finished no doubt

[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=68) doubt to complete the whole course  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=71) well well before i get there let me let  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=74) me throw a question back at you  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=75) that's okay fine like before we even get  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=77) to like the importance of the course  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=79) and the course is phenomenal it's  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=80) amazing we haven't gone through it and  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=82) you know instructed it but before i get  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=84) there tell us a little bit about the  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=86) genesis because i think that's  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=87) interesting  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=88) the genesis well from what i remember  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=90) one of our instructors delivered a  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=92) similar course it was called no doubt i  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=94) think  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=95) and it dealt with the kind of  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=97) intellectual foundations of islam from  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=99) the point of view of how to address  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=101) ethical doubts scientific doubts  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=105) philosophical doubts and stuff like that  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=108) and then  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=109) i think after a few years when we  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=111) established  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=112) sapience one of the main purposes of  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=116) sapience was to  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=118) empower muslims so our main strategic  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=121) focus is to  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=123) develop and empower muslims so they are  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=125) able to  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=126) intellectually academically articulate  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=128) islam right  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=130) to their brothers and sisters in  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=131) humanity what we felt was  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=134) that it was important to develop a  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=135) course to deal with people's  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=138) hearts which is the plural for doubt  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=140) shubo heart doubts right  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=142) and because we're all about empowerment  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=146) we usually talk about the adage which is  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=149) if i remember correctly  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=151) if you give a man a fish  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=155) he would eat for a day if you teach a  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=158) man to fish  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=160) he would eat for a lifetime yeah so we  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=162) want to empower we wanted to and we do  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=164) want to empower muslims to be able to  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=166) deal with their doubts and the doubts of  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=168) other people and from a wider strategic  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=171) strategic perspective we want them to be  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=173) able to intellectually and academically  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=175) share islam  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=177) in a robust way of course and defend  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=179) islam so  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=181) with regards to the course itself is  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=183) designed  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=184) not to answer every single one of the  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=187) shubuhat  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=188) we'll be here until god knows when until  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=190) the day of judgment right  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=191) but rather it's an empowering course  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=194) where we give people 10 effective  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=197) strategies  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=198) on how to deal with their doubts their  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=200) own doubts and the doubts of others  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=202) and these strategies have been  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=204) specifically designed to create that  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=205) empowerment  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=206) and these strategies are not what you  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=208) would call just a road map you don't  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=210) start from the beginning and the end  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=212) you understand all of the strategies and  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=214) based on the metaphysical backdrop which  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=216) you'll explain  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=218) you basically use them as a toolkit so  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=220) you maybe think strategy two three  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=222) seven and eight is what i need for  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=224) myself or for this person  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=225) or maybe all of them it depends and once  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=228) you understand the kind of spiritual  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=229) social intellectual context of that  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=231) person  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=231) then you could basically use the most  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=234) relevant and appropriate strategy  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=236) so i think it's an amazing course  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=238) there's nothing like it not really  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=240) it's very empowering and i really  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=243) ask every single one of  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=247) you watching to attend the course  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=250) from start to end because everything  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=252) will make sense right  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=254) so is that good enough yeah yeah  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=258) all right so i have a question for you  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=260) all right which is what about my  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=262) questions too man  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=264) what is this okay the battle of the  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=266) questions  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=267) okay so my one is so  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=270) what do we cover so i mean well we  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=272) started off with uh the metaphysical  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=274) backdrop  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=274) and i think that the fact that we  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=276) started off with it  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=278) it highlights its importance not only in  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=280) this course  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=281) but we also repeat that same information  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=284) uh albeit not in as much detail as we do  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=287) and no doubt  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=287) in other courses like for instance uh  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=290) waking the truth within  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=291) we do it there and the divine reality  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=293) has a section so why is metaphysical  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=295) backdrop so important  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=296) well metaphysical backdrop is so  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=298) important because like you mentioned  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=300) if we were to just answer every single  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=302) question we would be here for  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=304) years yes and what metaphysical what the  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=306) metaphysical backdrop does  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=308) is it empowers the person by having them  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=310) understand things and concepts like  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=312) world views  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=313) worldview yeah what is the lenses by  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=316) which people are looking at the world  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=318) and reality  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=318) how do you establish what is what is not  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=321) and so on so we get into some detail  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=322) about that related to  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=324) you know ontology you know epistemology  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=326) how do we you know what is  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=328) when we think about knowledge for  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=329) instance uh you know sources of  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=331) knowledge  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=332) yeah and so and things like that and you  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=334) know we do a really nice uh  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=335) outline based on world view which is  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=338) what i remember  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=338) when you delivered it it was empowering  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=341) from the point of view that  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=342) when someone asks you a question that  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=345) raises a super  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=346) a doubt a destructive doubt or if you  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=349) within yourself have a destructive doubt  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=353) it empowers the individual to basically  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=356) understand that  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=358) that is only a shubha if i adopt the  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=361) worldview of that  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=363) person exactly or i adopt an alien world  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=365) view right so what you do is that you  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=367) give them the kind of conceptual  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=369) metaphysical lenses to really understand  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=371) hold on a second in order for even this  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=374) shubha to be valid and by the way we  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=376) know shubahat are not valid and we  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=378) discuss that in the course  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=379) but in order for it to be valid from the  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=381) point of view that it would affect me i  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=382) have to  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=383) swim into the ocean of the alien world  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=386) view which is basis anyway  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=387) right so it was very empowering but how  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=390) does the fitra fit in this whole  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=392) metaphysical backdrop then because you  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=394) in in  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=395) in the in the section on metaphysical  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=397) backdrop you also talk about the fitra  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=398) so  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=399) yeah so what's with that so so one of  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=402) the things that we uh  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=403) we speak about is that any sort of  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=405) worldview a person adopts and of course  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=406) everyone has a worldview as we mentioned  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=408) in the course  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=409) uh you know i think i mentioned in the  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=410) course itself that it's kind of like  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=412) language  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=412) right everyone has a language that they  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=414) adopt you're born into it you you know  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=415) you don't even think about it and you  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=417) speak like it's a really important  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=418) point isn't it right we want to be so  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=421) important brothers and sisters that  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=423) you know if you're not married and you  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=425) have a marriage meeting it should be one  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=426) of your questions  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=427) what's your what's your world view do  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=430) you know what i mean no i i think that's  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=432) you know what i mean i i yes because i  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=434) actually taught the things so yeah i do  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=436) know what you mean but anyways  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=437) moving on to the world view and its  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=439) connection with the fitrah  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=441) uh we spoke about how everyone has a  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=442) world view yes and the thing is that  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=444) world views  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=445) um they are based on assumptions like  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=447) any world view any you know when you  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=449) talk about modernism postmodernism  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=451) assumptions or first principles yeah  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=452) assumptions first principles i mean we  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=454) get into the details yeah  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=455) as well right and of course for us our  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=458) first principle  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=458) our you know assumption you know we give  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=461) we talk about our lens right  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=463) our lens right uh is the fitrah and so  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=465) we get into some conversation we get  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=467) into some discussion about  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=468) what do we mean by the fitra why is it  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=470) important that that be the lens by which  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=472) we look at reality and how we understand  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=474) reality  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=475) um and so we get in details about that  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=476) and so that forms  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=478) the metaphysical backdrop so before we  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=480) get into the 10 strategies in earnest  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=482) we get into a very deep dive into world  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=485) views  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=486) and fitra okay and i believe and i  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=487) really think it's extremely empowering  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=489) like i can tell you that  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=491) when i've had conversations you know as  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=493) you know we have lighthouse  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=494) where we have one-on-one mentoring  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=496) services people and  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=497) you know i really feel a lot of times  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=499) when you're speaking to someone it's  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=501) not about the specific question they're  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=502) asking a lot of it has to do like wait a  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=504) minute where are you what lens are you  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=505) looking at this question  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=506) absolutely you know we had a sister on  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=508) one she had a question about you know i  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=510) don't really understand these ayats and  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=511) the quran from you know  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=512) and then when we started to dig down  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=514) deeper she had a a very clear  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=516) lens of feminism which has its own  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=518) assumptions and  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=520) its own worldview so she had a an alien  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=522) worldview an ideology whether it's  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=524) feminism or whatever the case may be  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=526) and she basically used it as a lens to  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=528) view islam  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=529) right and that's why the schubert heart  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=531) arose that rose yeah yeah so  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=533) it's not just dealing with the schwa  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=534) it's actually dealing with that world  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=535) view first  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=536) and that changed the way they see things  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=538) yeah and that's what was so beautiful is  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=539) that once i pointed that out  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=540) and i said look let's look at it from a  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=542) different perspe let's look at it from a  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=543) different world view  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=544) right one that you claim to have adopted  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=546) right which is islam  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=548) and let's look at it from that worldview  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=549) and that was very empowering for her  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=550) because she at the end she said you know  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=552) that actually makes sense now like i  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=553) understand it from a worldview  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=554) perspective brilliant so  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=555) it's it's an it you know i mean that  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=557) part of the course i think will  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=559) really you know people are really going  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=561) to find out empowering  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=562) so and the thing with the fitrah which i  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=564) think you highlighted which is very  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=566) important  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=567) is that when we understand the fitra  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=569) even the two main opinions in our  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=570) classical tradition yeah  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=572) the fitra gets clouded if you want to  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=573) use such terminology and we do use such  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=575) metaphor  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=577) and the point here is there are  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=579) different ways to uncloud the fitrah  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=582) to awaken the truth within or to allow  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=584) the fatal to direct itself towards the  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=586) truth  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=587) so the clouding could be one of the  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=590) shubuhat could be one of the doubts  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=593) right and our strategies could be the  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=594) way to uncloud the fitrah  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=597) to allow the fit or the innate  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=598) disposition to direct itself towards the  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=600) truth  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=601) and that is so important because once  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=602) you understand the almost the kind of  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=603) metaphysics or the psychology of the  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=605) fitrah  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=606) you you make sense of yourself you make  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=609) sense of other people exactly and you  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=610) become more intellectually spiritual  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=612) and spiritually mature to be able to  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=614) deal with these issues in a very  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=616) profound and deep way so that's  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=617) brilliant  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=618) so after metaphysical backdrop what's  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=620) your notes dude um  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=621) all right what's the next one next one  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=625) nature of the heart me oh the nature of  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=627) the heart so if we're  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=628) speaking about fitnah we understand you  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=630) know and as you know you'll see in the  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=632) course  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=632) is that we speak a lot about shubuhat we  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=634) speak a lot about its etymology  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=636) right the the the word itself where it  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=638) comes from this brother  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=639) this uh individual right here he likes  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=642) talking about the etymology of etymology  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=644) at infinitum yeah but uh but he calmed  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=647) me down so you you could have gotten a  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=649) lot more  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=650) and been put to sleep a lot quicker no  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=652) i'm kidding but  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=653) um but we speak about the term how it  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=656) resembles the truth  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=657) it doesn't have any sort of substance to  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=659) itself in reality  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=660) it resembles the truth it's like a wolf  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=662) in sheep's clothing right right and and  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=664) we talk about how it attacks the heart  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=666) and so that's why the next section that  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=668) we speak about is the nature of the  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=669) heart itself you know the fact  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=670) is the kalben is called because it  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=672) overturns  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=674) you know and all and so we get into that  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=676) we speak a little bit about iman and  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=678) and how to understand that and how to  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=679) understand it in a way that transcends  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=681) how sometimes just translated as belief  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=684) yes right because sometimes we have a  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=686) you know again going back to world views  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=687) we have a kind of a judeo-christian way  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=689) of looking at  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=690) the term because from that world view  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=692) the term faith  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=693) the term faith right belief or faith uh  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=695) that we just assigned to it some sort of  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=697) pledge that you make that i believe such  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=699) and such yes iman has a different  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=701) dynamic or  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=702) like a leap of faith yeah right like a  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=704) leap of faith blind jump  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=705) exactly but iman comes from the root  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=707) word to feel secure exactly  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=708) and so so before that we talked about  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=710) the fitting of the heart  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=712) no we get that a little bit like oh do  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=714) we oh it's like the shahawat and the  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=715) shubohat yes  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=716) yes so you know after that and i'll put  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=718) on my notes here  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=720) so yeah so we talk about the heart's  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=722) main fifth in that section the next  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=722) section yeah okay good  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=723) so we start with a metaphysical backdrop  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=725) yes right that's where we start from we  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=726) talk about nature of the heart yes then  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=728) we move into the  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=729) fitting of the heart look at the trials  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=731) and tribulations of the heart  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=732) which are different from the spiritual  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=733) diseases yes of course of course so  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=736) you know and these we you know we say  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=737) that scholars categorize them into two  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=739) main categories so so we speak about the  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=741) two main  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=743) fit right one is the shubahat which are  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=745) the destructive doubts which is what  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=747) we're going to be talking about in  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=748) detail  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=748) then we talk about yes desires you know  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=751) those things the blame  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=752) the blameworthy desires right and  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=755) you know speaking about the covering of  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=757) the heart as you mentioned or the  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=758) clouding of the heart  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=759) yes you know one of those is actually  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=761) stems from desires when a person  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=763) goes beyond right the the the bounds  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=766) you know everyone has desires and as  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=768) long as you don't go beyond the bounds  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=769) then it shouldn't really affect a person  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=770) but when they do  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=771) yes it puts a stain on the heart yes  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=773) right like the prophet sallam said  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=776) yes so there but there is a relationship  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=778) between shahawat  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=779) although we do say in abstraction yes  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=782) are far  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=782) worse than shahawat because one of the  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=786) distinctions that we make concerning the  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=787) shubu heart the destructive doubts  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=789) is that they are they try to undermine  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=792) the foundations of islam and distort the  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=793) religion yes  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=794) now shahawad blame with blame where the  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=796) desires on their own don't do that  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=798) and that's why they could yeah so by an  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=800) abstraction  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=801) shubahat are far more dangerous however  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=804) if you continue them right they can lead  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=806) to shubahat because for example if  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=808) someone starts drinking and they know  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=809) it's haram  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=810) then fine it's not undermining the  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=812) religion it's not undermining the  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=813) intellectual foundations of islam  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=815) but over time what can happen they could  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=817) start saying oh you know what maybe it's  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=818) not too bad maybe it is halal and maybe  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=820) this and maybe the quran was wrong  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=822) and everything yeah so that's the thing  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=823) man you know they say like i mentioned  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=825) this in the course as well they're just  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=826) saying  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=828) right that the intellect is a a hired  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=831) lawyer  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=831) so eventually what happens is when  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=832) you're kind of engaged in a sin for too  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=834) long  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=835) you have kind of this uh this  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=838) instability right so we talk about iman  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=839) meaning stability  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=840) so your mind like it knows it's wrong  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=842) but if you keep doing it then it wants  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=843) to give it justifications sure right  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=845) and it happens to all of us right when  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=846) you know if you think about okay you're  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=848) doing something and eventually like yeah  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=849) maybe there's a difference of opinion  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=850) maybe i'll ask sheik son so or so-and-so  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=852) and then you start getting and so  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=854) and so that's why you know no doubt that  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=857) shubahat are definitely more dangerous  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=858) because they're undermining the  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=859) foundations  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=860) but excessive shah waters long-term can  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=863) lead to  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=864) can lead to shubahat which can be you  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=866) know have the same effect  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=868) okay so then we moved on to then we  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=870) moved on to  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=872) my man we moved on to uh we were  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=875) the source of doubts okay good yeah yeah  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=877) so the sources of doubt  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=878) the sources of doubts were philosophical  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=881) ethical  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=882) and trauma yes philosophical  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=885) philosophical scientific  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=886) ethical and trauma social so basically  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=889) the kind of negative experiences people  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=892) experience in their life that that give  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=895) rise to should  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=896) heart and these could include traumatic  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=898) experiences right absolutely negative  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=899) experiences and  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=900) we made a distinction between big tea  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=902) and small tea traumas  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=904) we talked about them yeah and how to uh  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=906) address those from the point of view of  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=908) shubohat and after we went to  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=910) so then uh we spoke about um we we  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=913) started the course well we talked about  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=914) today's  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=915) crisis and challenges all right that was  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=916) a bit of a summary so it was a bit of a  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=918) summary and then actually we spoke about  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=920) the fact that if a person is  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=921) you know engaging with the world today  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=923) what are some of the modern  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=924) you know i say modern in terms of in  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=926) terms of a time period what are they  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=928) what are people facing and what are the  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=929) people  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=930) what are people's challenges today  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=931) ideologically so you have atheism you  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=934) have  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=934) modernism liberalism post modernism  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=936) feminism all the  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=937) isms and schisms that people have to  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=939) deal with a lot of people and it happens  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=941) to most of us we become  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=942) in the words of hijab ideologically  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=944) molested  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=945) [Laughter]  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=947) are you ideologically molested  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=948) intellectually  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=950) was it subservient mentally  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=961) unfortunately these ideologies are like  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=964) a tsunami trying to engulf the hearts  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=965) and minds of our brothers and sisters of  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=967) everybody  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=968) the hearts of humanity and this and this  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=970) goes back to the importance of this  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=971) course though  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=972) because remember it's not just a course  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=974) about you dealing with yourself  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=976) but you could be in a position let's say  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=978) you're an imam let's say you're you're a  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=980) parent  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=980) point you know and you could be in that  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=982) position and you might  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=984) you might understand it from your own  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=986) like your own background your education  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=988) like i don't deny that any sort i would  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=989) not i would not doubt that what we're  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=991) in what we're teaching in terms of  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=993) content per se is something new to like  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=995) someone who's been through islamic  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=996) studies yes a deepest but the reality is  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=998) we want to but the methodologies the  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1000) methodology brought it together  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1001) in a unique way exactly in order for the  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1004) imams and the meshach to be empowered  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1006) yes exactly and that's why this is very  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1007) important for teachers for parents for  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1009) imams for messiah  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1011) absolutely and remember to bring this  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1013) back to a  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1014) practical context we receive so many  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1017) questions  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1018) about people's doubts we can't address  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1020) everything it's like almost practically  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1021) impossible  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1022) limited resources and so on and so forth  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1025) right so  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1026) this course from a strategic point of  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1028) view i think it should be a game changer  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1030) because once they're empowered with  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1031) these strategies  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1032) insha allah by the will of allah  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1037) absolutely and so you know we would want  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1039) this in different languages as well  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1041) yeah turkish in urdu in malay  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1044) in arabic yeah in all the languages  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1047) whatever language we get in so  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1048) we so now we talk about the ten  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1050) strategies yeah then we outline the ten  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1051) strategies we get into them and you know  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1053) we  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1053) start off by speaking about be aware  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1055) okay so  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1056) before we get into that there was a  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1058) distinction that we made concerning  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1059) there are some strategies that  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1061) you adopt before the surprise right  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1064) right and  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1065) and some strategies after the shubha and  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1067) some strategies are both  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1068) yeah and some strategies do with both so  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1069) say this is the heart this is a surprise  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1071) like a parasite  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1072) who wants to latch onto the heart and  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1074) drain the iman yeah so there's one stage  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1076) where the shrub has here  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1077) yep and that's when you have some  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1079) strategies other strategies the surprise  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1081) is just about to get into the heart  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1083) yeah strategy and other strategies when  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1084) it's already infected in the heart okay  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1086) good  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1086) so what's be aware so be aware  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1089) is the strategy which actually is before  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1092) the  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1093) attacks the heart right okay and this  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1095) has to do with prevention  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1096) right so you know we speak about the  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1097) term prevention rather than cure  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1099) so this is now to be aware of the  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1101) shubahat that they exist that they're  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1103) dangerous  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1103) uh the fact that they're dangerous and  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1105) so on and so forth so and to be aware of  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1106) the nature of shubahat from the islamic  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1108) spiritual tradition that it's  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1110) tush bihu it tries to resemble something  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1112) that it's not yes  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1113) it's a wolf in sheep's clothing and as  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1115) it mean to me i said may allah have  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1116) based on him that a  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1117) the reason shubahat sometimes people can  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1120) accept or  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1121) they take seriously because they have a  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1123) tinge of truth  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1124) yeah that's but they're not truth  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1125) they're not and that's this thing with  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1127) anything right like anything that you  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1128) accept around you has to have some  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1129) element of truth  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1130) that's why some people also yeah that's  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1132) why some people fall in love with like  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1133) post-modernism  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1134) yeah or other things other things  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1137) right now because we'll be a bit  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1138) controversial do you know what i mean  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1140) but the point is there are some  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1142) ideologies or ideological constructs  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1143) that there are some like you know  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1145) justice right islam is all about justice  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1147) so when they see the social justice  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1148) movement like yeah we're about this as  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1150) well but  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1151) they're adopting a world view when they  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1152) do that and the set of ideological  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1154) presuppositions you know  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1156) and they become that's why ideologically  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1157) molested as hijab says  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1160) but anyway so so be aware is to be aware  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1162) of the sh of the shubha  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1164) but also be aware that they exist right  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1166) and be aware that they're dangerous  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1167) yes you know a lot of times it's like  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1169) what if i just go to this website what  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1170) if i just check this out  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1172) you check it out and that's that's how  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1173) the thing starts so you know  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1175) and again one of the things we mentioned  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1176) when we cover this section is that we're  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1177) not saying that you don't engage with  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1179) these things once  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1180) you have the you know the intellectual  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1182) emotional spiritual psycho spiritual  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1184) tools it's so important you said this  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1185) because it's not just an intellectual  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1186) issue because some people think hey  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1188) if if i'm an intellectual then i  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1190) couldn't address this  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1191) but that's the point if you're not aware  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1193) of what shubahat are  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1194) right are also spiritual matter yes i  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1197) know this personally bro in my  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1199) in my own journey yeah i'm answering  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1201) someone's question i think he left islam  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1202) i answer his question he comes back or  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1204) something like that  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1206) yeah i'm not convinced with my own  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1207) answer but i'm later convinced with my  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1210) own answer when it came from someone  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1211) else  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1211) right and i saw a correlation about with  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1214) my spiritual state  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1216) of course and where i was along that  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1217) journey of course so we shouldn't be  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1218) under the kind of  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1220) naive and intellectually immature  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1222) position that hey  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1223) i have the robust rational answer no it  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1226) doesn't work that way shubahat have a  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1228) spiritual  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1229) cognitive emotional reality to them  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1232) right  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1233) and this is line with cognitive  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1234) psychology you know no one is  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1236) an ai machine as we discuss in awakening  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1239) the truth within  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1240) and it's not just about abstract  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1241) rational arguments there's there's a lot  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1243) of  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1244) psychosocial emotional spiritual  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1246) whatever you to call it  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1247) elements that are going on driving  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1248) forces are going on and we need to be  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1250) mature about this  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1251) yeah i mean look i mentioned this in uh  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1253) when you speak about beauty  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1254) and we talked about that experiment  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1255) about you know how your own your  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1257) beautiful  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1258) architecture so we even spoke about how  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1261) even the architect  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1262) yeah i didn't say that i was beautiful  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1263) but that's fine i mean you know yeah  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1265) i'm joking no i'm kidding you're very  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1268) beautiful no no i'm already kidding man  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1270) so no i'm saying that um in that  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1272) particular uh  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1273) in that series that we do or that talk  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1275) that i did you know i mentioned that  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1276) even the architecture that you live in  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1278) can have an impact on your cognition  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1280) that's wrong that's an architecture  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1282) and you can actually your your cognition  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1284) can be  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1285) enhanced can be you know uh it can be  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1287) made better you can have less cognitive  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1288) biases by  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1289) having more interaction in the natural  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1290) world something as mundane as most  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1293) people might think of right now  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1294) it has a profound impact and so you know  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1297) something like that you taking a walk in  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1299) nature can have an impact on your  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1300) cognition  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1301) imagine what you know when it comes to  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1303) doubts and things like that  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1304) so that's why you have to be aware of it  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1306) and your beauty section which you  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1307) mentioned in this course as well  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1308) i believe so it reflecting and  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1311) experiencing natural beauty  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1313) gives you all and all increases  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1315) cognition and low  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1317) yeah which is very important in the  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1318) context of spirituality exactly  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1320) intellectual argument  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1321) because how many people do you know that  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1323) they won't accept your argument  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1325) not because they're not they're not sold  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1326) on your argument right  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1328) okay the quintessential example is when  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1330) people get into a fight with their  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1331) spouse  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1331) yeah that's the one and that's you know  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1333) you're wrong but you just keep going  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1335) because it's just it's just ego  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1336) yeah yeah yeah right for sure so yeah so  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1338) be away is be where they exist and that  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1340) helps you that empowers you from the  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1342) point of view that  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1343) you know if you're walking down the  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1344) street and someone says there's a really  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1346) there's an armed gang at the end of the  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1348) street you're aware of that so you're  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1349) not going to walk that path right you're  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1350) going to go somewhere else okay good so  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1351) what's the next one  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1352) uh to not pay the intention no attention  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1355) no attention okay  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1356) what did you cover from this so  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1358) basically in this section we spoke about  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1360) you know that uh and again this is  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1361) before the shop  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1363) yes this is before before and so you  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1365) know you're going to have the shubhad  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1367) you have to basically not paid any  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1368) attention i mean just as it as the term  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1370) states  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1370) you know don't give it any attention  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1372) don't give it any you know look what is  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1373) the shobha as we mentioned and as you'll  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1375) see in the course  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1376) it doesn't have any sort of real value  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1378) it's a a  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1379) a wolf in sheep's clothing yes so if it  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1381) doesn't have any value you have to  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1383) proactively not pay any attention to and  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1385) just  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1385) don't give it any attention yeah at the  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1386) stage when it hasn't infected you yet  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1388) right  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1388) exactly exactly and with the knowledge  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1390) that you know it doesn't have a basis  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1392) exactly good okay good so then after  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1394) that it's then we get into the  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1396) uh the the conversation discussion about  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1398) making a distinction  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1400) and this is one i think that uh yeah a  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1402) lot of people don't really  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1404) may not really uh may not they may  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1407) know it to some extent but the fact that  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1410) we outline it in the course where we say  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1412) look there are  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1412) you know there are certain things that  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1413) are like valid questions right and then  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1415) there's  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1417) and then there are there are you know  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1419) what's was right  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1420) says right and so and to be able to make  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1422) the distinction between those three  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1424) between those three is extremely  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1426) important because  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1427) a person could have a valid question and  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1429) that's fine  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1430) but a lot of it has to do with a like  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1433) what how are they approaching the  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1434) question  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1435) right so for instance you know you know  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1437) behave the difference between a shubha  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1439) and a valid question like what would a  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1441) difference be a shoba val question  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1443) yes so you're right we want to make a  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1445) distinction between those three because  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1447) sometimes when people have wasfasa they  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1448) think it's a shubha  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1449) yeah and then they get really confused  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1451) but then you may end up being a supplier  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1453) which is crazy so the way you've made a  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1455) distinction is very powerful so we make  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1457) a distinction between what you said was  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1460) and valid questions and the difference  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1462) between a behind a valid question a  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1464) valid question is  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1465) literally any question that you don't  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1467) intend to undermine  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1469) the foundations of islam and you don't  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1471) intend to distort the religion  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1472) yeah and by the way that attention you  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1475) get empowered  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1476) but in the duration of this course when  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1478) you when you have a good grounding in  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1479) world views and fifa  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1480) yes right so that empowers you when  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1482) you're at this stage as well good sorry  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1483) go ahead you know it's fine  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1484) uh then after so shuppah is different  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1486) it's like it's actually making you  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1489) undermine the foundations of islam and  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1491) it's it's driving you towards  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1493) distorting the religion yeah so  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1496) making those distinctions are very  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1497) powerful so you don't get confused  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1500) because shaytan could use that against  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1501) you because you can't make those  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1502) distinctions you think of valid  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1503) questions  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1504) you think of what you're shooting you  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1505) think a valid question is a wasp you get  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1507) all  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1508) yeah and it's a nightmare exactly so  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1510) what's the distinction between a wasp  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1512) and a subhan in a question then well we  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1514) have to take the course to see that  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1515) that's very get into it you know so when  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1518) i give them  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1518) clues right now just just to empower  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1520) people very quickly it's something that  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1522) you have a psychological psychological  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1524) aversion to yeah you don't believe in it  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1526) um and the sahaba had this as well and  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1529) the prophet said that this is a sign of  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1530) iman so if you have a wasp son of iman  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1532) but as long as you know it's not true  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1534) and you have a psychological aversion to  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1536) it and the way to deal with it is not to  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1538) speak about not to act upon it  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1540) exactly okay so then we go to then so  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1542) the next uh next section is one's  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1544) environment you're invited oh yes that's  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1545) what i do  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1546) yes yes so your environment is extremely  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1548) important we  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1550) we go into like social psychology and we  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1552) talk about the development of the social  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1554) norm we talk about normative information  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1556) normative social influence informational  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1558) social influence  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1559) informational social influences are  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1560) needed for certain normative social  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1562) influence i need to belong  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1563) and that drives us to basically  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1567) submit to a subgroup a dominant group  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1569) and if  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1570) the subgroup or dominant group or in  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1571) this context a dominant group have  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1573) alien values or ideas we may adopt them  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1575) or we may basically  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1579) align ourselves to them because we have  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1581) a need to belong we have a need to feel  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1582) certain and that could basically take us  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1584) away  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1584) from the tradition from islam and we  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1587) said just be aware of that we talked  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1588) about some social psychological  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1590) experiments  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1591) to show that you know society does  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1594) affect you this is like almost  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1596) this is this is like almost like an  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1598) absolute fact it's intuitive right  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1600) because if you  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1600) it's intuitive as well yeah if you're a  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1602) son or if you're a father or an uncle or  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1604) whether the case may be  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1605) and you know your your niece or nephew  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1607) or your daughter or your son  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1609) they say i want to join this group of  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1611) friends and you know these group of  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1613) friends  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1614) they they have drug issues yeah or  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1617) look even something are you gonna let  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1618) them go yeah you know society doesn't  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1620) affect anybody  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1621) it doesn't have to be that extreme you  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1622) could be like you know what uh  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1624) you know uh muhammad over there like  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1626) he's you know he's he's studying all the  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1628) time he's memorizing the quran  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1629) and you know uh you know you know you've  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1631) got recruits from harvard that are  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1633) looking into him  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1634) all right then you've got uh whatever  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1635) you know salim over there  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1637) and saleem like yeah he's doing well  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1638) he's getting bees and stuff and  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1640) man you know maybe he'll go to u of h  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1642) without reference to everyone who's  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1643) going to u of h  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1644) and uh who who are you going to have  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1645) your kid be like you know what maybe you  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1646) should make friends with muhammad over  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1648) there absolutely  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1649) it's intuitive and it's it's you  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1651) mentioned like cognitive psychology  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1652) there's a lot of studies in it that that  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1654) that social psychology social psychology  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1656) that bolster the idea that that you know  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1658) your environment matters yes and the  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1660) thing is in the quran  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1661) yes as well so we talk about the quran  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1663) we talk about the son of the prophet  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1664) sallallahu alaihi with some about  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1666) the importance of your environment and  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1668) your friends and  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1669) just coming back to the point about that  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1671) it's like almost an absolute fact  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1672) obviously there are differences of  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1673) opinion in academia about  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1675) you know how norms are developed and so  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1678) on and so forth and what  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1679) and how influence how social influence  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1681) actually influences you but the point is  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1683) the underlying theme is  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1685) there is an influence of your the  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1687) environment does influence you of course  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1689) and that is extremely important to be  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1691) aware of that and what the solutions are  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1692) from  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1693) a quranic and sonar perspective we talk  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1695) about that brilliant  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1696) the dog yeah the doctors we let them  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1699) we let them what yeah we let them attend  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1702) the course so they understand that  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1704) all right uh we're not going to give  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1705) them everything uh yanny  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1707) of course of course this is  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1710) so the next section we covered was study  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1713) islam  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1714) okay so you repeat that a few times did  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1717) it  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1718) no no yeah of course we did we did it  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1719) once i knocked that joint once  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1721) no way let's be honest this course was  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1723) extremely  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1724) i think it was very intense yeah the  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1726) other course both of them but they were  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1728) very um yes of course  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1729) intensive repeating certain sessions so  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1731) many times just to get it right yeah i  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1733) don't know how people do it may allah  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1734) bless  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1735) all the brothers and sisters that do  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1737) this type of work because it was  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1740) it does take a lot out of you i think  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1742) because you're concerned about the end  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1743) user isn't it so you're repeating  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1745) so many different you know and a lot of  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1747) it may have to do with just how  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1749) i guess how important we feel the course  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1751) is yeah no 100  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1752) this is something that because we deal  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1754) with so often and we deal with it on  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1756) lighthouse we deal with  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1757) people that we speak to you know and i  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1759) just got an email i think it was like  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1761) yesterday  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1762) um you know someone that i know back  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1763) home and you know was one of the islamic  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1765) school teachers that she emailed me and  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1767) she said you know i needed to speak my  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1768) son and  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1769) you can really sometimes you can really  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1770) tell even through email like how much  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1772) pain a parent might be going through  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1773) yeah 100  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1774) so that adds i guess a kind of a level  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1776) of pressure in a sense that you want to  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1778) make sure it's right so people  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1779) understand the concepts and  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1780) yes you know so so study islam so if  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1782) i'll be honest i did it  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1784) a number of times because of that yeah  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1787) so would you cover  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1788) and study islam what's the main point  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1790) well the main point is that you know  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1791) once a person studies  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1792) islam when they study the you know the  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1794) studies islamic tradition  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1796) it should empower the person right and  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1798) it annihilates doubts it  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1799) completely eradicates doubts you know  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1801) and that's and obviously we're with the  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1803) physical backdrop understanding world  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1805) views yeah and all of that  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1806) but once once you've kind of understood  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1808) that and then you start you know taking  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1809) a sincere  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1811) you know uh you know you take a sincere  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1813) journey in  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1814) in the path of seeking knowledge right  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1816) and i'm not talking about going out  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1817) somewhere abroad and studying in some  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1819) sort of form but just  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1820) having a sincere you know uh desire to  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1823) learn the religion yeah  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1824) learn learn people should stand in the  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1826) possibility that the more you learn  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1828) about islam  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1829) of course of course from the spiritual  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1831) tradition and the  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1832) classical tradition i think one of the  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1834) most beautiful aspects that we that i  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1835) covered in the  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1836) in this section was the motif of light  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1840) right no i don't want to start you know  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1842) because we're going to be here but it's  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1843) a beautiful motif  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1845) but the point i'm trying to say is that  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1846) people should stand in the possibility  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1847) that learning the  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1849) islamic tradition will eradicate their  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1851) doubts and it does so you gave two  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1853) examples two case studies yeah so we  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1854) talked about um the age of consent  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1856) yeah it was one of those uh that's one  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1857) of the the the the shabbahans that might  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1859) come up  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1860) yes and how the ulsuli tradition just  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1862) annihilates this yeah yeah of course and  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1864) it's just  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1864) you know a lot of times there's so many  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1867) you know aspects to that particular  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1869) section we talk about you know is the  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1871) concept of age the first of all  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1873) you know is it something that's  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1874) trans-historic trans-cultural et cetera  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1876) and the arbitrary nature  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1877) arbitrary nature is based on principles  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1880) right  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1880) right exactly we don't have to unpack  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1882) that right now so the other case study  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1883) was  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1884) on inheritance okay good yeah and so we  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1886) get into  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1887) some details about that um you know i  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1890) speak about the complexity of the  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1892) inheritance law itself yep and the  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1893) principles involved the principles  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1895) involved  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1895) the nuances involved you know one of the  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1897) things that i highlight and i don't want  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1898) to get into the whole course now  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1900) is that a lot of people when they when  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1903) they are faced with true behave they  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1904) want to have a quick short answer  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1907) without any sort of nuance and the  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1908) reality is i mean you're looking at over  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1910) a thousand years  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1911) of a civilization and you know that this  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1914) is a nuanced  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1915) area well this is legal theory it's  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1917) legal theory right so good reasoning  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1919) even in secular law if you want to find  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1921) out about a certain ruling you're not  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1923) going to basically  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1923) you're not going to say like well you  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1925) know this is how it is you go to a  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1926) lawyer  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1927) yeah i mean i can give my own example  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1928) when i study tax law  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1930) you know i mean it's complex man you  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1932) have the code which is like two big  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1934) volumes and  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1934) eight volumes of the of the you know irs  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1936) regulations  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1937) and you know you have opinions upon  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1939) opinions you have case law you have to  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1940) study you know you're making  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1941) so you know when people kind of say like  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1943) oh isn't it true that you know women  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1944) just get more than men it's such a  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1946) less yeah sorry that they get but the  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1949) funny thing is we show that in 16 cases  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1951) women get more maybe that  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1952) was a yeah so we show that the whole  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1955) ruling is not about  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1956) the so-called intrinsic value of a  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1958) particular gender  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1959) yeah yeah and we talk about the  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1961) principles and we show how shallow this  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1963) accusation is but it's based on knowing  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1964) the knowledge of islam yeah exactly  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1966) okay good so after this what do we do  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1969) after we get into  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1970) study islam we look at um oh we look at  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1973) your  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1973) section what's that it's critical  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1975) thinking oh yeah yeah  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1976) critical thing so like i think i did  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1978) study islam what like maybe  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1979) five times and you're critical thinking  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1981) like what 25 times  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1983) i think like four days you spend on  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1984) critical thinking no no no i spent a few  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1986) hours in it so  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1987) so critical thinking was important  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1989) because we believe that using  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1991) your critical thinking abilities your  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1993) rational faculties  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1995) your ability to ponder think et cetera  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1997) in essence using  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=1998) the function of the kalib which is the  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2000) akal using that in a sound way and given  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2003) that all other variables are sound like  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2005) your heart  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2006) is you know in the right place from a  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2008) spiritual perspective  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2010) that that will be a barrier to shubu  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2012) heart because if you're able to  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2013) critically think  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2014) then it just annihilates the shuba heart  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2016) now what's  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2018) interesting is now what's interesting is  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2021) a lot of the shubahat  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2023) they are taken seriously because we  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2024) don't have the ability to critically  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2026) think  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2026) exactly so i give i think i gave a  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2028) scenario about someone  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2030) or if i didn't let me just give it out  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2031) very quickly someone asked a question  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2033) about the higgs boson  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2035) this was many years ago and the higgs  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2036) boson was a particle that they found  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2038) they found the empirical justification  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2040) for the higgs boson which is a particle  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2042) of the higgs field what's the higgs  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2044) field  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2044) it was something that switched that was  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2046) switched on the early universe that gave  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2048) particles mass apart from the photon of  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2050) course and  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2052) you know they called it the god particle  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2053) in the kind of popular articles and then  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2055) someone said oh bro my iman something's  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2057) wrong with my iman or something like  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2058) something like that because they found  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2060) the god particle and i'm like what's  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2062) going on here so i did a bit of an  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2063) investigation and then i realized  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2065) this had nothing to do with god it was  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2067) well from the point of view everything  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2068) is to do with allah but the point is  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2071) it doesn't negate his existence it just  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2072) found a particle yeah of a field  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2075) now they call it the god particle  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2077) because the generous journalists were  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2078) lazy because originally it was called  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2080) the god damn particle because it's so  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2081) hard to find  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2083) exactly so you see the point things like  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2085) this i mean  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2086) it's a crude example but you get you  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2088) have to be able to critically think  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2090) in actual fact that example itself  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2091) proves goes existence because any  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2092) particle  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2093) anything physical is contingent yeah  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2095) right exactly  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2096) it's possibly existing it's  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2099) and everything that is mumkin  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2101) necessitates wajaba  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2103) the necessary existing being which is  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2104) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and this  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2106) argument is in all the schools of creed  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2108) right anyway the point here is  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2110) critically think so we talk about what  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2112) is critical thinking what is developing  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2113) good arguments generating good arguments  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2115) and  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2116) what is that you know how how do you  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2118) develop the ability to find out errors  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2120) in people's reasoning we talk about  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2121) formal fallacies  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2123) uh informal fallacies we give some  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2124) examples and we do that in order to  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2126) empower you  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2127) to be able to critically think and that  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2129) if you use your alcohol in a sound way  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2132) and obviously the alcohol is a function  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2133) of the kalb and given if all the other  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2135) variables are fine concerning your kalb  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2137) if you use the aqualinus in a sound way  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2140) it can be a means to put to be a barrier  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2142) against shubohat and we unpacked that  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2144) further so what was next after that well  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2146) let me ask question before i  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2147) get to the next section um you know  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2150) everything that you learned  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2151) everything that you learned up to this  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2152) point is that all on your own accord  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2155) or have you learned it from other people  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2158) i like what you do  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2158) you're connecting it to another well i  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2160) mean i'm just you know because a lot of  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2161) people think like you know  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2162) we are standing on the shoulders of  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2164) giants yes thank you very much that's  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2165) the thing and that's  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2166) in actual fact we have epistemic  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2168) limitations we're never going to know  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2169) everything it's impossible  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2171) even in western epistemology testimony  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2173) the epistemology of testimony  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2174) you know you have dr elizabeth fricker  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2176) she says given that her that her  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2178) limitations are parametric she has to  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2179) rely on the authority of others this is  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2181) worn on anything on anything  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2182) yep and that's the next section it's  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2184) finding especially find a specialist  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2185) right okay so what do you unpack here  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2186) so unhappy just basically what you said  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2188) right that we have epistemic limitations  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2190) and then  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2190) you know we can't a lot of times we feel  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2192) that we can let's say when it comes to  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2194) the realm of shubuhat  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2195) that we're going to basically study when  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2196) we study and we got it but sometimes  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2198) you you may need help with that you know  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2200) that's part of that's part of like the  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2201) community you live in whether it's  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2203) if you want to consider an online  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2204) community or the local community is that  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2206) we have  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2206) people we have specialists that can deal  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2208) with certain things that can deal with  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2210) your epistemic limitations right and the  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2212) important thing is that  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2214) they should stand in the possibility  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2216) yeah  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2217) if you're dealing with yourself or  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2218) dealing with someone else that we do  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2220) have specialists in the community that  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2222) can answer these questions  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2223) and just because we've had history yeah  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2225) just because you don't know the answer  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2226) doesn't mean the answer doesn't exist  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2227) exactly  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2228) right so yeah so that's what we're  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2229) covering and the next section after that  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2231) is  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2231) where we deal with trauma oh  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2234) so tell me a little bit about let's say  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2236) a trauma that you've been through oh  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2237) thanks  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2238) well i'm on like with your shrink now  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2240) yeah you're my  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2249) ladies and gentlemen here's the thing  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2251) every human being goes through trauma  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2252) absolutely just because he's thinking  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2254) about it no no  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2254) no no no no of course absolutely so  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2258) a trauma that i've gone a trauma that  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2261) i've experienced from  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2262) a kind of shoulder heart or doubts point  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2265) of view  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2269) guess so one trauma was maybe a  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2271) self-imposed trauma where  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2272) when i became a muslim i felt that i had  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2275) to now  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2275) break down my hero that was my father  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2278) and because he was a muslim i should  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2279) just basically  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2282) look just basically trying to  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2284) deconstruct his personality that he's  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2285) actually a bad person he's not worthy to  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2287) be my hero because he's not muslim  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2289) which is a very unknown islamic position  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2291) to take and i spent a lot of time  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2293) actually relating to my father in a very  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2295) negative way  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2296) and that was an internal trauma that i  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2298) created myself right  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2299) because of lack of knowledge lack of  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2301) guidance whatever the case may be not  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2302) understanding islam properly  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2304) and then that trauma was unpacked when i  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2307) went on this kind of psychology  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2308) course three-day course where they just  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2311) broke me down it was like  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2312) you're just you just they you know you  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2315) just say you know i'm not gonna say who  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2316) i am but you know you're just a piece of  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2318) you know excrement right and  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2319) your ease with ego yeah it's your you  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2322) know your  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2322) your need to be right and never be wrong  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2325) you need to impose and never be imposed  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2326) upon your  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2327) need to always look good and never look  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2329) back bad to the extent where you give up  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2331) the truth and to the extent  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2332) that you give up what is right right so  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2334) that ego  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2335) was giving up what was the right way to  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2338) to approach and relate to my father and  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2340) even the truth that  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2341) of course he still has those virtues of  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2344) course he's my hero  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2345) with regards to many things and there's  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2346) nothing wrong with that this is part of  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2347) the islamic tradition the person praised  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2350) um non-muslims you know  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2353) khalid bin walid or radhilahan became  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2355) muslim because muslims  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2356) called him a wise person yeah in essence  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2358) right so the point here is  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2361) it's uh that trauma was unpacked for me  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2364) when i went through that experience but  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2365) not everyone has those experiences but  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2367) that was a self-imposed trauma the way i  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2369) was relating to my father but then after  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2370) when i picked up the phone which was  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2372) part of the  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2372) homework once i understood that  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2374) self-imposed trauma  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2375) and understood that the meaning i'm  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2378) giving the situation  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2379) is not the meaning that the mean i was  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2382) given wasn't the correct meaning the  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2383) correct meaning was the meaning that  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2384) allah wants me to give it right which  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2386) was treat your father with respect  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2388) love your father appreciate his hair and  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2390) so on and so forth  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2391) which i didn't do so the reason i had  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2394) that self-imposed trauma because i did  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2395) not stand in the possibility that the  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2397) meaning i was giving it wasn't the right  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2398) meaning  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2399) but the minute i said well actually the  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2400) meaning i'm giving it is wrong and it's  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2402) not  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2403) powerful and it's not empowering it's  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2404) not an islamic  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2406) in the minute i understood that and i  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2408) gave allah's meaning i gave the correct  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2409) meaning  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2410) that totally transformed everything  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2412) right and it goes down and this is what  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2414) we  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2414) speak about in the in the section on  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2415) dealing with trauma is that you know  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2417) stand in the possibility  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2419) that you would give your trauma a  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2421) different meaning yes right and this  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2422) isn't just from the islamic framework we  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2424) talk about  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2425) you know um psychologists who actually  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2428) you know advise the same thing stand the  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2430) possibility that you give it a different  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2431) meaning yes and what was the statement  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2433) um  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2434) who was it uh wasn't nietzsche it was uh  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2436) our holocaust survivor  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2438) oh it was victor franklin victor frankel  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2439) yes very powerful very powerful  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2441) statement he said something to the  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2442) effect of  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2443) you know if if um your trauma has your  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2445) trauma has meaning  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2447) no if you're suffering as me i think you  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2448) should use suffering if your suffering  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2450) has meaning that it's not suffering at  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2451) all or something to this effect right  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2452) very powerful yeah and that's really but  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2454) what we do in this section we say stand  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2456) the possibility of the meaning that  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2457) allah gives it  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2459) is the correct meaning absolutely right  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2460) this is absolutely and this is very  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2462) empowering and very  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2463) uh you know it's and this is also  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2465) something we mentioned in the other  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2466) course that awakening the truth within  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2468) yeah  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2468) absolutely that is a means for doubt  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2470) people have trauma small  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2471) traumas big traumas right because we're  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2473) not going to judge them that they're  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2474) small or big everyone has their own  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2475) experiences  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2476) but the minute and i'm i'm a strong  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2478) believer of this the minute you stand in  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2479) the possibility that the meaning that  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2481) you're giving this trauma is not the  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2482) correct meaning and the meaning  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2483) and if you give the meaning that allah  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2485) and his messenger want you to give the  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2487) the trauma  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2489) then that would be a means to uncloud  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2490) the fitra to awaken the truth within  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2492) and in this case it's a barrier against  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2494) tribal heart exactly  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2496) exactly so after this what do we do we  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2498) focus on  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2499) on the heart man oh yes this is this is  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2501) your thing bro  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2502) i don't know about my thing but you know  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2503) yeah so we focus on the heart and  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2505) because you know we  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2506) we start in the beginning of the course  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2508) you know we talk about the heart itself  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2510) it's position it's  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2511) centrality when we're talking about  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2512) shubuhat and all of those things so  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2514) you know we would have to have a section  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2516) where we look at the heart we look at  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2517) it's um  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2518) you know basically it's it's you know  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2520) understanding the heart understanding  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2522) something about  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2523) in a sense the human being as well and  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2524) what kind of position and how to  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2526) strengthen the heart from a spiritual  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2527) point  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2527) and so we get into like how to  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2528) strengthen the heart you know what are  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2530) the mean strength in the heart  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2531) now obviously we're not going to get  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2532) into an entire course on the heart  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2534) right but again we're giving you we're  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2536) giving the the essential elements  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2538) essential elements  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2539) to how to do that especially in relation  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2541) to shubohat right  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2542) and why is it important yes because it's  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2544) imperative  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2545) imperative that a person has a very  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2547) strong heart a sound heart  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2549) right when dealing with shubahat you  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2550) know allah you know he talks about  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2553) you know the fact that on the day of  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2555) judgment the only thing that would be of  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2557) any sort of benefit for a person is a  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2558) sound heart right  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2563) right on a day where neither wealth or  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2565) children will benefit a person except a  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2567) person that comes with a  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2568) sound heart yes right and so we get into  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2571) a discussion about iman  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2572) and the heart and then we talk about you  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2574) know strategies where we can use in  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2575) strengthening the heart you know things  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2576) like vikkar  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2578) things like prayer and quran and all  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2581) these things that you know some many  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2582) many people might already know  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2584) but by the time they get to this stage  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2585) in the course i think  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2587) by going through you know the  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2589) metaphysical backdrop by going through  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2590) some of the other strategies and things  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2592) like that  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2592) we understand you know you get to the  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2594) point where okay now these things  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2596) have a different meaning from a certain  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2598) perspective right and when you make time  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2600) when you make vikra for instance there's  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2602) a thicker you can make that's just kind  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2603) of quick and like let me just get it  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2604) done  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2605) but then there's a viktor where it's  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2606) like okay so this is going to have an  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2607) impact on me  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2608) yes and my position in relation to ish  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2610) because i remember  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2612) is weak it's baseless yeah but it  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2615) attaches to the high try to drain your  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2616) iman  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2617) if your heart is strong then the  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2619) shubuhat will bounce away it will fall  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2621) off if you like  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2622) yeah and this is why it's very important  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2625) to strengthen the spiritual heart and  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2626) i've  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2626) said even my own experience you see that  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2629) i'll be infected with shubu hearts  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2631) based on my spiritual state so less  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2634) thicker  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2634) less connection with allah more  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2637) heart yes or the superheart that i was  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2640) even addressing and i dressed them well  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2641) for someone else  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2642) i wouldn't be convinced but when my  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2644) spiritual state changed  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2645) it was a different dimension it's a  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2647) different reality rather and then you  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2648) know the thing is that there's  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2650) you know you you really it's one of  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2652) those things that you have to understand  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2653) maybe experientially  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2654) right yes uh you know the statement i  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2656) think we mentioned this in the course as  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2657) well  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2658) that ibm mentions that he that he takes  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2660) from uh  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2663) mercy upon both of them i mean where he  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2665) says that you know and i'm just  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2666) paraphrasing now like don't let your  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2667) heart be like a sponge  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2668) just soaking in all of the shubahat  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2670) rather let it be like a glass  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2672) so that you know that it's hardened  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2673) glass so that you're able to see the  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2675) sugar hot but then when they come they  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2676) just bounce off just like rain right  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2678) like rain drops you're able to see the  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2679) rain  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2680) so you can see it from you're not  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2682) getting wet but you're not getting wet  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2683) nice  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2683) right and so and by the way we have an  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2685) analogy of the heart to be like glass we  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2687) talk about eye to nose it's uh you know  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2689) we wanted some details about that but so  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2690) the point is is that this section what  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2692) it's all about is strengthening the  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2694) heart making it strong making it you  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2695) know the opposite of being a sponge  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2697) uh and we have you know a few things and  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2699) that we relate  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2700) related to that you know we talk about  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2701) good so there's one more section of this  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2703) right  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2703) so that is making dua yes you know dua  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2706) as uh  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2707) is the weapon of the believer absolutely  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2709) and really  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2710) this is all about our metaphysics  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2712) because we realize that allah  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2716) we are solely dependent on him yeah none  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2718) of these strategies would work  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2719) absolutely if it wasn't for allah  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2720) subhanahu wa yes he is  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2722) he is the self-subsisting he is the  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2726) independent he is he is the free he is  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2729) the independent  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2730) and everything including ourselves of  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2733) course  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2734) we are solely dependent on allah even  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2736) our worship  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2737) our purpose in life is to worship allah  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2739) right but in surat al-fatiha the thing  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2741) we read what 70 at least 17 times a day  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2745) you alone do we worship and you alone do  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2747) we seek help in that worship yes  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2749) right so i mean worship you know we're  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2753) solely dependent we need that  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2754) from allah and so what this section does  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2757) it's about dua where we  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2758) we are now solely we're we're casting  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2761) ourselves before all of subhanwa  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2762) and you mentioned some of the of course  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2764) and then it's about  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2766) strengthening the heart the most famous  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2767) one yes  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2771) of hearts keep my heart firm upon your  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2772) religion yes and we look at dwa's from  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2774) the quran  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2774) that was one of the most off-repeat of  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2776) the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2778) correct  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2779) i remember no i don't know okay not sure  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2781) about that but yeah  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2782) double check that yeah yeah so brilliant  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2784) but uh so this last section i mean  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2786) really just kind of  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2787) it hopefully brings the person home to a  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2790) certain  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2790) brings the person to a certain state  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2792) where they are casting themselves before  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2794) allah and that's really  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2796) you know that's really what in essence  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2798) that's what it comes down to right a lot  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2799) of times we think  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2800) as long as i have the rational answer  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2802) you know this is what we unpack in the  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2804) fitra and  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2804) limits of rationality and things like  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2806) that but one of the things we have to be  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2808) very aware of is that you know we could  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2812) you know you could learn everything  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2813) there is to learn like how many people  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2815) are  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2816) you know very well versed in islamic  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2818) studies  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2819) in western uh you know you know in  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2821) western within western academia  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2823) they could teach most muslims islam  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2826) but they don't have the most valuable  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2829) thing that you're going to need on the  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2830) day  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2830) is iman right so you know this whole  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2833) concept of just learning information  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2835) some sort of you're getting you know  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2836) abstract knowledge we speak about that  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2838) as well yes like we're not just doing  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2840) this in a vacuum but it has to be  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2841) applicable you have to be able to  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2842) analyze  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2843) internalize and apply it and and live it  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2845) basically and what's important from  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2847) uh from the perspective of dua as a  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2849) strategy  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2850) is to make people realize that the other  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2852) strategies  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2853) are only be are only going to be  
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2855) successful because of the will of allah  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2857) exactly don't give them some kind of  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2858) intrinsic value  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2859) yeah yeah  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2862) behind everything is the power of talent  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2864) so brothers and sisters those are the  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2866) ten strategies  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2867) and one last yeah sure you know with  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2869) these strategies one of  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2870) the other things we mentioned in the  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2871) course is that they're not they're not  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2873) they don't have to use in that order  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2874) yes we mentioned the beginning we did  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2876) okay you have to emphasize good  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2877) temperature so i mean just like you know  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2878) people might think like we have to do  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2879) one step one step two step three  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2881) remember somewhere before somewhere  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2882) after  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2883) uh you know and you're gonna depending  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2884) on your own personal context where you  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2886) are  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2887) in your journey in relation to allah  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2888) subhanahu wa'ta'ala and the person that  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2890) you're addressing and the person you're  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2891) addressing as well  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2892) i mean you might find strategy two five  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2894) and six to be you know the strategy that  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2895) you need or  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2896) or you know some other strategy and so  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2898) they're not in some sort of  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2900) you know uh there's no sort of hierarchy  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2902) when it comes it's not a road map it's  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2903) like a tool kit  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2904) yeah so you have your toolbox and you  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2906) could pick each of the tools that are  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2908) relevant to yourself  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2909) or the other person the person that  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2911) you're helping address their own their  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2913) doubts as well  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2914) so what people will find that if they're  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2916) talking about doubts about themselves  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2917) that this might be  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2918) and this is why it's so important to  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2920) stand in the possibility that these  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2921) strategies will work  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2922) that it might be a an awakening for a  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2925) lot of people because  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2926) it's um it's for if you're dealing with  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2928) the shuba hat yourself  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2930) you have to have some sort of level of  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2932) introspection you have to look inside  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2934) like peek inside of yourself right you  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2935) have that basila  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2936) right that's that insight right that  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2938) goes inside so or if you're  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2940) dealing with the shuba of another person  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2942) you have to kind of you know investigate  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2944) what is that person where are they  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2945) coming from what's their background  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2947) um and maybe have them have some levels  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2949) of introspection  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2950) something that they might not have done  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2952) up to this point and they're just  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2953) dealing with shubahat as  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2955) you know intellectual you know whatever  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2957) one thing we can say  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2959) alhamdulillah is that these are  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2960) effective strategies  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2962) and uh they've been designed  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2966) they've been designed to empower the

[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2973) they're helping themselves this would be  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2975) extremely effective for them insha'allah  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/RleAnrjY5FQ?t=2977) so
