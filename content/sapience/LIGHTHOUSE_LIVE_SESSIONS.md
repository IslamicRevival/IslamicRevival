[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=344) it that you wish to engage with is it a  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=346) particular topic is it to do with  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=347) morality is it to do with proofs of God  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=349) is it to do with Quran or Kira at or  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=351) whatever it is like just give us some  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=353) information to work off and then this  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=355) gets forwarded to your mentor and then  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=357) if they need to prepare it all they're  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=359) able to do so  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=361) um make sure to obviously read these  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=363) some people do this and they've not read  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=366) them unfortunately the service does have  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=368) to be uh you need to be 18 or over for  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=370) legal reasons  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=372) um we can provide the service to people  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=373) under the age of 18 at the moment but  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=375) inshallah we are trying to look into  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=378) that and expand on that  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=379) um and make sure to read the the  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=381) lighthouse mentoring terms and  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=382) conditions which you can do so there but  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=384) yeah it's a free service it's private  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=386) it's one-to-one it's done through Zoom  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=389) um you have a whole hour to discuss  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=390) whatever you wish sometimes it gets  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=392) finished earlier  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=394) um sometimes it doesn't  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=396) and yeah and you just have an  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=398) opportunity to just talk with one of the  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=399) mentors about whatever it is that you  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=401) wish to do so today inshallah there's 13  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=404) of you salam alaikum to those 13.  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=407) um  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=411) hbh  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=413) 786 and uh Muhammad Latif  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=418) ah  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=419) brother from Kashmir is joining the team  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=423) in the future insha Allah  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=426) um I've not actually asked him but I  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=428) could reach out to and see if he would  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=430) be interested  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=432) for the suggestion  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=436) um maybe he will maybe he won't Allah  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=439) um but always worth asking your brother  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=443) but uh  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=445) so I guess if any of you have got any  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=447) questions or anything in particular you  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=449) would like to discuss on the subjects  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=451) that we cover with Lighthouse  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=454) um don't ask 50 questions so I'm not  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=456) sure  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=457) I can't give fat words  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=459) and it's not really the purpose of this  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=462) um stream  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=463) to answer fit questions and stuff like  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=466) that if you're struggling with certain  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=468) doubts ask away  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=470) and I'll try my best to answer them  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=473) and we could discuss certain things if  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=475) no one has any particular questions I  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=478) guess I'll just pick something random to  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=480) talk about  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=484) to help you both well  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=489) um  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=493) um do you have a video disproving or  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=498) deconstructing solipsism  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=502) um I don't personally but I guess if you  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=504) want to ask  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=506) like make an argument for Solace so I  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=509) guess what I'll do I'll begin  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=511) by telling people how they should engage  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=513) with these things because they're not I  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=514) know it's a common trend  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=516) like let's say you're in the position of  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=519) belief like I am in a position of belief  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=521) I I got here through a number of things  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=525) um took a long time started looking into  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=526) Islam when I was about 17 didn't take  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=528) shahada until I was about 24. um a lot  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=531) of that was talking to Muslims engaging  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=533) in a dialogue with them asking them  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=535) questions them asking me questions  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=537) and putting forward positions they would  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=538) put forward one I would put forward one  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=540) I would push back against this they  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=541) would push back against mine  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=543) now if someone just comes to me and just  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=546) says Ah but solipsism  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=549) I'm gonna go  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=551) all right you could just say any random  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=553) word to me like I'm not that fussed  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=555) about these terms  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=557) um and I'm not  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=559) in the process of trying to prove things  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=561) for people  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=563) um without them giving me an argument  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=565) now there's many ways to argue for  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=567) different positions like whether it's  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=569) solipsism moral relativism  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=571) utilitarianism people take different  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=573) paths to each of these  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=575) positions  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=577) um solipsism in particular may have  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=580) many arguments that get people there and  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=582) people may differ in in regards to wider  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=584) solipsists  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=586) um so what I would do is I would ask the  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=589) question well  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=590) why are you a solar system what is a  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=592) solipsist for you as well in particular  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=594) because people differ in terms  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=597) you might talk to two people who  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=599) identify as a radical skeptic  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=602) um and you know you might find that they  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=605) actually are not that oh crap radically  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=608) skeptical about certain things  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=610) um so it's always worth just asking  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=612) questions and getting them to present a  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=615) position  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=616) now if if there's a particular argument  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=619) that's got you in a rut on this in  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=623) particular then give me the argument and  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=625) I can analyze it with you or we can talk  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=627) about it  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=628) um  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=629) and discuss it I've just built my groove  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=634) towel  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=637) yeah I wouldn't I find I don't I don't  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=639) know because you can't really tell much  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=641) from a tiny little comment like this  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=643) um so I can put the link out  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=646) maybe you can jump on and we can talk  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=649) you want to jump on the Stream  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=651) you will need to put your camera on for  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=653) a brief moment just so I can check  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=655) you're not a troll and do something that  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=657) I command you to do like  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=658) wave or hold up a certain amount of  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=660) fingers  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=661) this one  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=664) as we have many dramas on live streams  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=666) in past with other channels  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=669) that I wish to avoid but yeah so feel  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=671) free to act like  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=673) give me more information like what is it  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=675) about solipsism for example  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=679) do you want me to deal with like why  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=680) should we take it seriously  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=683) like what what is it what are the  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=685) reasons given  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=687) that make you think solipsism is  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=689) something that needs dealing with  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=691) in particular  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=694) this one  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=697) is that that's basically how I would  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=699) deal with these things  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=701) like I'm not fond of just someone says a  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=705) particular thing  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=707) a word a catchphrase a term  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=709) and then I'm supposed to deal with that  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=711) because that like what always happens  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=713) then is I might then approach one  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=715) particular argument and then someone  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=716) goes ah no but that's not a good  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=718) argument uh there's these other  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=719) arguments so you've strawmanned it or  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=721) that's not the position because they  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=722) hold the diff they've taken a different  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=724) path or a different route to that  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=725) position  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=728) uh  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=732) what is solipsism so solipsism  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=736) in particular  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=737) is a belief that uh  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=742) you can't really know anything beyond  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=744) maybe even maybe your own existence  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=748) let's have a look at what  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=750) rather than just going off the top of my  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=752) head  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=753) so solipsism is the philosophical idea  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=756) that only one's mind is sure to exist  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=759) an epistemological position solipsism  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=762) holds that knowledge of anything outside  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=764) one's own mind is unsure  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=767) there's a so there's a really good way  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=769) I guess if someone is stuck in that it  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=772) simply put us out  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=774) um  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=775) Maybe  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=777) get yourself a little candle  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=779) and a little lighter  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=782) light the candle  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=784) and you don't even need the candle you  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=785) probably just do it with the lighter but  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=787) just get them so hover their hand  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=790) over the candle for as long as they  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=792) possibly can getting it as close as they  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=794) possibly can  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=796) and eventually  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=798) I think they'll realize the candle  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=800) exists  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=803) eventually they'll get burnt  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=806) and yeah maybe they could still be  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=808) um  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=809) [Music]  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=811) skeptical but at the night like  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=815) I just find it to be a really  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=818) it's I find it to be a silly position  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=819) for a number of reasons number one  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=821) I don't think like I guess it depends on  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=824) why the person is a solipsistic I think  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=826) a lot of the time people become  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=827) solipsists because they try to do  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=829) something like they try to prove the  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=832) external world with deductive argument  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=834) and every time they try to do it  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=836) um they fail and or they like they find  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=838) it difficult to do so and so they end up  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=841) moving from this idea that well if I  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=843) can't deductively prove it then I can't  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=845) believe it exists as if everything  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=848) needs a deductive argument in order for  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=851) you to be justified and believing in its  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=852) existence now I think that's absurd I  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=855) don't think that that is reasonably  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=857) something you can expect off every  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=859) person on the planet  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=861) to be able to  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=862) give deductive Arguments for belief in  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=867) things which pretty much everyone  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=870) takes for granted apart from these odd  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=873) uh individuals that get stuck in this  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=876) sort of philosophy rabbit hole  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=881) um  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=882) and like for me  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=885) belief in the external world is  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=887) something I would just call a basic  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=889) belief or something that you don't need  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=890) a rational argument for because it if  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=893) you if you're going to be saying that  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=894) you need a deductive argument or  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=896) everything needs some sort of deduction  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=898) argument in order to be justified in  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=900) believing it then you need to provide a  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=902) deductive argument for that proposition  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=904) you need to give me a deductive argument  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=907) that shows absolutely that every  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=910) argument  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=911) needs a detoxive argument because if you  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=913) can't provide an argument for that  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=914) particular claim that everything that in  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=915) order to be justified in believing it  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=917) needs a rational argument  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=919) you can't make that claim without giving  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=922) me a rational argument for it  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=924) and you just you you end up going either  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=926) like you go brain dead and you just go  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=930) oh well apart from that one thing or  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=934) uh you you take this like infinite route  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=938) where you try to give some sort of  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=940) argument and then each premise in that  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=941) also needs an argument and then each  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=943) premise in that argument needs an  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=945) argument and you just end up going on  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=946) forever you don't really get anywhere  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=948) and uh so yeah it the whole thing I  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=952) think is uh  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=953) built around this idea that everything  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=955) needs a rational argument I don't think  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=956) the external world does this matter  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=959) deductive reasoning  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=962) um is not something you're born good at  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=964) no one is born  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=967) rational or reasonable in the same way  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=969) that no one is born strong like if you  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=971) want to become fit you want to become  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=972) healthy you want to become the world's  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=974) strongest man  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=975) you don't do that from birth you've got  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=977) to train you've got to work you've got  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=978) to put in effort and energy in  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=980) particular practices to be able to  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=982) become good at it and it's the same with  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=983) rationality or reasoning  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=985) um and just not everyone has access to  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=988) the  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=989) to that kind of education  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=991) um like you know the the farmer the  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=993) cleaner you know your random Joe are  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=997) they really expected to be able to give  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1001) a deductive syllogism  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1005) sound  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1007) and completely unflawed and then go  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1009) through the process of Defending it  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1010) rigorously against some PhD in order to  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1014) be justified in believing that the  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1016) external World exists and then engaging  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1019) with it  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1020) as if it does  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1022) I think this is just something you could  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1024) take for granted the external World  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1025) exists you know if you put your hand in  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1027) the fire  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1028) uh you're not going to be a solipsist  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1030) while you're screaming in pain  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1034) or if you're kidnapped  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1037) and someone is um  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1039) you know  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1041) taking away your freedom  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1044) from you and limiting you and you're not  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1047) able to do whatever you want you're  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1049) going to come to a point where you have  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1051) to admit that there are things external  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1053) to you that act upon you that you don't  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1055) have control over that the external  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1057) world does have some sort of existence  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1058) doesn't mean you have to know everything  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1059) about it  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1061) um or know it in some sort of complete  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1064) manner  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1065) um  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1066) yeah I don't know  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1069) what else being said

[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1181) in the description to this video  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1183) uh so feel free to book a private one if  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1185) you would rather talk privately or if um  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1188) you don't mind feel free to  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1193) post your question in the chat or jump  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1195) on the Stream  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1200) all right what's the fact that's what  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1203) I'm saying according to the contingency  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1205) argument the existence of the universe  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1207) can or cannot be  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1210) it's not according  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1213) just to the contingency argument  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1216) this is I would guess  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1218) something you could say whether or not  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1221) you're making a contingency argument  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1224) um  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1224) you would look at the universe you say  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1226) oh well the universe  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1228) and you know this everything has a  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1230) beginning they even say that the  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1232) universe will come to an end at some  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1233) point it'll die a heat death or it'll  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1236) dissipate into nothingness as well  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1240) so things have Beginnings things like  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1242) ends  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1243) that existence can be turned on that  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1245) existence can be turned off  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1248) so that's what it means to be contingent  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1251) um  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1252) and it can be in any different way  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1255) so it is contingent  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1258) you don't have to even make mention of  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1259) the fact of that it could be different  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1261) um  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1262) in terms of its variation you could just  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1264) focus on the fact that its existence  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1265) could be turned on or off  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1268) um but yeah some do go down the roof  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1270) different ways so it is continued my  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1271) question is how can I think of a  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1275) non-existent universe  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1279) uh  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1280) isn't it's contradictory why are you  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1283) trying to think of a non-existent  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1284) universe  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1286) because a non-existent universe  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1289) I got I guess it depends what you mean  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1291) by that  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1292) so by a non-existent universe do you  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1296) think are you thinking like a  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1297) hypothetical universe  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1299) that doesn't exist  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1302) but could do  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1304) or are you talking about  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1306) nothing and then adding the term  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1308) Universe to the nothingness where  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1310) there's there is no thing  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1313) what which of the two are you talking  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1315) about  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1316) um isn't it contradictory I mean the  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1317) mind would argue that thinking of a  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1319) non-existent universe  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1321) well it depends  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1323) what you mean by a non-existent universe  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1325) so like if you're talking about  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1327) nothingness like absolutely nothing I  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1329) just would not apply the word Universe  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1331) to that  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1333) at all I'll just refer to it as nothing  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1337) um  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1338) but if you're talking about a universe  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1340) that could potentially exist but doesn't  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1342) at the moment and you're just talking  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1344) about it hypothetically  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1346) um then there's nothing contradictory in  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1347) that because  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1350) you're talking about what could be like  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1351) for example like if I'm talking about a  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1354) car that could exist and that this car  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1357) it's non-existent at the moment  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1360) um  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1361) but you know if it did exist you know it  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1363) would have these big curly wings that  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1367) went  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1368) and the the wings would uh be this color  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1374) um  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1375) that grades very very gradually  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1379) uh from polar opposite colors also I  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1383) don't know like just a list of  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1385) attributes that are random of a thing  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1386) that doesn't exist yet yeah you go back  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1389) in time  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1392) and you've got some little little  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1395) medieval people sat around and they're  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1396) talking about this thing that's going to  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1398) be metal and it you know it doesn't  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1400) exist yet  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1401) like there's nothing completely  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1404) inconceivable or contradictory about  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1406) them  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1407) talking about these things oh look at  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1410) this  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1412) how are you doing alhamdulillah good how  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1415) are you alhamdul very well  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1417) so yeah for joining us yeah we're just  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1420) doing a little Lighthouse live it's not  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1422) gonna be for long  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1423) um it's just for another 35 minutes  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1425) we'll finish at 8 p.m inshallah brother  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1429) Imran is uh it's kindly offered his  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1431) services for the lighthouse projects as  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1433) well so nice  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1435) it's excellent work mashallah very much  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1437) needed  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1439) um I I haven't seen any of the streams  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1441) so far so I've literally got the message  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1443) and I thought I'd just jump on inshallah  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1444) yeah there's not much going on yet uh I  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1446) have posted the the link I'm just trying  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1449) to address this question so someone's  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1451) asking about uh according to the  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1454) continuity argument the existence of the  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1456) universe can or cannot be  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1458) and it can be in a different way and  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1459) that's why it's contingent the question  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1460) is is can I think of a non-existent  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1462) universe isn't it contradictory so I'm  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1464) just trying to explain that  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1466) it depends what you mean like if you're  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1468) talking about nothingness and trying to  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1469) call that a universe yeah then you're  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1473) adding this thing to something which is  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1476) a knob thing and then that becomes a  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1478) contradiction you're trying to give a  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1479) property to a non-existent thing yeah  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1481) but if it's just talking about something  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1483) that could potentially exist like a  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1486) universe where me and you uh on opposite  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1489) sides  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1491) or I'm in your house and you're in my  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1493) office yeah you're welcome anytime by  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1496) the way yeah new to mine as well lovely  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1498) couch it's all a bit background blurred  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1501) but but yeah so that I wouldn't say that  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1503) would be contradictory even though it  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1505) doesn't exist  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1507) because it's not the possibility isn't  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1509) it yeah yeah yeah yeah  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1511) okay so this is your field so I'm sure  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1514) that you're uh  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1516) yeah I think he's just sort of uh  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1519) he's got himself mixed I don't know his  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1523) question is not very clear so I don't  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1524) really know  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1525) uh what he means in particular but  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1528) like so just going on into it moisters I  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1530) mean that the the mind would argue that  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1532) thinking of a non-existent universe is a  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1534) contradiction because thinking of a  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1535) non-existent universe would require  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1538) a thinking entity  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1540) for example can I imagine holding a ball  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1542) in my hand while Simon saying instantly  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1544) imagining that I don't exist  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1545) well no you wouldn't be able to  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1548) but thinking about a non-existent  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1550) universe doesn't require you to think  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1553) the  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1554) I don't know I think you're over  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1556) complicated yeah  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1557) is the uh maybe I don't understand the  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1560) question is the question about uh  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1562) another universe that um has  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1565) is like this universe but different  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1567) somehow but doesn't actually exist yeah  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1569) or is it actually the question about  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1571) existing thinking of something that  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1573) doesn't exist and calling that our  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1574) universe there are two different things  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1575) aren't they what was the what's up I'll  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1578) put the link in so you're welcome to  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1580) jump on or maybe we can like talk  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1582) through it and the question is as well I  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1583) guess why is this bothering you or is it  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1585) bothering you is it something like as if  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1588) it's just like a question  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1590) then fair enough it's not that big a  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1592) deal but if this is something that's  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1593) like keeping you up at night  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1595) um  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1598) then obviously like I think the brothers  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1600) made a comment there  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1603) I understood Amex nothingness with you  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1605) okay okay yeah so like if you're mixing  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1608) two terms together that are  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1610) contradictory then it would become  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1612) contradictory  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1613) um  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1615) but just like I don't see how like  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1618) hypothesizing for example  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1620) about a potential universe that could  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1622) exist even though it doesn't would be in  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1625) the same way that I could talk about  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1626) that car that I mentioned like you know  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1629) it's got curly wings and it has uh like  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1633) these big ribbons that come out of the  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1635) windows like it might not well they're  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1637) saying that that kind of car probably  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1638) exists these days but  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1640) um like just pointing at something that  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1643) doesn't exist yet isn't enough to say  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1645) that it's a contradiction because you're  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1646) not saying that it does exist the  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1648) contradiction is is when you're  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1649) asserting two properties of the thing  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1651) simultaneously  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1653) in the same way  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1654) about the same thing  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1657) in the same in the same everything so  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1660) one example is the married Bachelor you  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1663) say like if I say brother Imran here  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1666) masha'allah he's uh he's a married  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1668) Bachelor  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1669) you can say well no that that's  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1671) contradictory because you're saying that  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1673) he is married and simultaneously in the  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1676) same way at the same time he's not  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1678) married  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1679) but you can't make both of those claims  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1681) about the same thing you're not saying  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1683) anything like that when you're talking  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1684) about  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1685) and a non-existent universe that you're  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1687) hypothesizing about  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1689) because you're not claiming that it does  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1690) exist  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1691) if you said that this non-existent  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1693) universe does exist  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1695) that would be the contradiction  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1697) that's when you're just going to be  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1700) careful with the language and I think  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1701) this is the biggest problem with  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1702) philosophy  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1704) is sometimes language is the weirdest  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1707) thing like even simple words sometimes I  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1709) say like you know I like porridge in the  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1713) morning and I put banana in my porridge  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1715) but the word banana sometimes just  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1718) doesn't look like a word to me  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1720) you know what I mean oh Flamingo is  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1722) another aubergine there's some words you  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1724) say them enough  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1725) and they just stop  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1727) seeming like Words is that is that like  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1729) a northern thing or something  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1731) I don't know I thought it was again am I  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1733) the only one  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1735) um are you looking at a word and it  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1737) stops looking like a word or who have  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1738) you never looked at who and thought why  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1740) is that said who a  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1745) yeah so in uh so we get lots of words  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1747) like uh pneumonia the piece that's  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1750) another one and then we have lots of  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1751) these phone  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1753) uh but if you give it to a child they'll  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1756) they'll try and say the P initially and  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1758) then that's intuitive yeah those lots of  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1761) those types of things  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1762) um yeah you know with English you can  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1764) spell fish uh as this  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1768) uh isn't this the pH  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1771) uh  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1773) I'd say it's only one t I'll spell it  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1775) with two T's uh  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1777) there we go this  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1779) let's fish  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1781) in English yeah  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1783) okay  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1784) I should come here more often I learned  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1786) something else you want to know why it's  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1788) fish I can tell you why it's fish is  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1790) that like a Gaelic dialect or something  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1792) no no no no no no you say it's the GH  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1794) from enough  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1797) oh I see yes you got the fur it's a GH  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1800) from enough  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1801) and then you've got the the O from women  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1808) and then you've got the ti  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1811) from potions here from West from westery  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1814) potion potion okay yeah yeah so GH is  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1819) the fur from enough fur the O is the the  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1823) if from women  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1824) and the ti is the uh  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1827) firm potion  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1829) so  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1830) fish  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1832) but it's just because English is a weird  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1834) language  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1836) the bottom of it it's a mishmash of many  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1838) different places because we're just  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1840) getting invaded  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1841) from every angle constantly yes so you  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1845) must be indigenous from everywhere  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1846) martial law yeah yeah yeah  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1848) um you know you know the the sessions  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1850) that you do the lighthouse sessions  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1852) mashallah  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1854) um when you do these events like that  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1856) you're talking now you're doing this  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1857) live stream what was the was the purpose  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1858) to answer questions or are you talking  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1860) about the lighthouse  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1861) yeah no so answer questions as well so  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1863) basically what the point of these  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1866) kind of you know I was meaning to speak  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1868) to you about this as well it's kind of  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1869) like the doubt Busters  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1871) I need to advertise the service because  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1873) it's a private one some people get  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1874) anxious about asking questions publicly  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1876) or going online and of course  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1878) um there's a certain character type that  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1881) inclines towards jumping on a live  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1883) stream and there's obviously the  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1884) introverts struggle with that  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1886) um so this service is here I guess to  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1889) make up for that lack in the market  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1891) because we've got lots of live streams  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1892) going on everywhere and people can yeah  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1896) um you know their hands is then there's  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1897) millions of them  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1899) um when you can jump on you can have  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1901) these conversations publicly but not  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1903) everyone can do that so these are  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1904) private free one-to-one we don't want to  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1906) put any barriers in people's way  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1908) um the information that you provide is  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1910) not made public  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1911) um it's kept private and you can chat to  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1914) either myself or to put a Hamza or  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1916) inshallah not to fire the future but  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1919) Imran and Abbas inshallah is joining as  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1922) well  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1922) and we've got a few other brothers  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1924) um who are engaged in the  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1926) the mentoring um so you could just have  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1928) this nice conversation and the majority  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1930) of them go really well  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1931) I have had so many nice conversations  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1934) with people that are just panicking over  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1936) something and you talk them through it  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1938) and then the Hat just settles and they  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1940) go oh I feel silly now  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1942) but sometimes people just need that  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1944) discussion and I think one of the  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1946) biggest problems at the moment is many  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1948) mosques are not really equipped to  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1950) answer some of the weird questions like  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1951) like actually Islam  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1955) it's not I want to say weird I don't  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1956) mean like you're weird like I mean it is  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1959) a these questions can get a bit abstract  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1962) in a bit out there  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1964) um and I think for the average person  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1966) that maybe attends the mosque they've  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1969) maybe probably not even thought in that  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1971) much detail about these type of things  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1972) so when they hear these kind of  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1974) questions it just goes over the head or  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1975) they don't know how to respond or they  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1976) panic  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1978) and they react badly and um yeah it's a  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1981) shame so this I mean we get lots of lots  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1983) of emails you personally as well as to  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1986) to EF Tower and I'm sure everyone is the  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1988) same of people just sort of you know can  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1991) you help me with this sort of specific  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1992) question or something and it's and it's  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1995) often that they have they're not able to  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1997) come onto a live stream or they they  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=1998) don't want to so I think this is a  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2000) really essential service I think the  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2002) other for me the other thing that is  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2003) really useful about this is that you get  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2006) time you get time to talk to somebody  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2008) one to one and that's really missing in  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2010) another four or another another sort of  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2013) um platform so you can't really do that  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2014) so those two things combined if you have  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2017) something that you you think is you know  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2019) I don't really want to talk about this  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2020) openly  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2021) um and also I need a bit of time to  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2023) explain what's happened and what I'm  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2025) thinking and then this is sort of it's  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2027) open to that and I think that gives  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2028) people a bit of reassurance that it's  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2030) private it's available that you can book  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2033) it at your own uh you know your  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2034) convenience and it's not rushed as well  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2036) like sometimes with the live streams  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2038) it's like right you've got one point you  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2039) can make you're going through that and  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2041) then we've got to push you off and get  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2042) the next person on and it's not  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2044) necessarily done with bad intent it's  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2046) just if you've like for example you've  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2048) got these live streams sometimes you  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2049) have like 50 people waiting in the back  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2050) yeah absolutely and like you don't want  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2052) to like just give one person five hours  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2054) of time  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2056) and then everyone sat down in the back  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2058) waiting for their turn and they don't  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2059) get an opportunity and the stream ends  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2061) um whereas with this like you book a  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2063) service if you get through everything in  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2065) one session alhamdulillah if you don't  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2066) you can go you can book another session  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2068) you can book in the same day at the same  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2070) time and get you know um get through to  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2072) the same person uh or you can book it on  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2074) another day and inshallah maybe get  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2076) through to someone else but yeah it's  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2078) there for as often as you need it and  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2081) you can keep coming back obviously the  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2083) whole point of the service is to sort of  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2085) equip you to be able to deal with these  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2086) things yourself  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2087) well we wanted the whole you know the  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2090) saying that we generally give is we want  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2091) to teach you how to fish not just be the  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2093) person that gives you fish every time  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2095) you're hungry  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2096) um and the whole point of the  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2097) conversations is we're not just trying  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2098) to answer the question but we're trying  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2100) to get you to think in such a way where  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2102) you can go away and deal with them  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2104) yourself because like like me for  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2106) example I do  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2107) about 50 of the sessions  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2109) um that we're doing at the moment and  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2112) I get a lot of questions and a lot of  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2114) them I just don't know the answer to  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2115) sometimes it's just like  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2117) good question I don't know and like I  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2120) don't go into a state of panic  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2122) and so people do like they come across a  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2124) question it's very very common like I  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2126) literally had like like one session  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2128) after the other where it was just like  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2129) one brother suffering from the very same  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2132) thing as the next not necessarily the  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2133) same topic but in the same way like they  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2136) come across something and the way he  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2139) presented it was like uh he was having a  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2141) discussion he was giving dollar to  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2142) someone and they  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2144) um they they put him on the spot and he  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2146) was like and then I didn't and like I  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2147) don't know how to answer it and then you  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2149) know I'm like am I a cafe  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2153) they go into a state of panic where they  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2155) can't sleep they get into a state of  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2157) depression and then they ring me and I'm  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2159) like why do you think that makes your  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2161) Cafe like just simply because you don't  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2163) know the answer to a question that's  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2165) like saying I'm a caviar if I'm not the  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2168) all-knowing like that's not how it works  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2171) you're you are finite there are going to  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2174) be things you don't know the answer to  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2176) and that's completely normal and you  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2178) need to be able to like  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2179) come across certain things  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2182) and go oh that's an interesting question  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2184) I don't know the answer to that I will  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2187) look into it or like inshallah Allah  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2190) will give me the answer at some point  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2191) because there's some questions as well  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2193) that like you get the answers to  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2196) straight away like you go on a Google  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2197) search or you reach out to a friend or  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2200) something you get the answer like that  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2201) there's some that take ages there's some  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2205) like that you might never get because  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2207) it's not incomprehensible that there are  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2209) some things you're just not going to get  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2209) the answers to yeah yeah lots of things  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2212) like that but a lot of the time it's  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2213) just trying to instill these virtues in  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2215) people you know virtues of things like  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2216) patience Etc  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2218) um getting people to you know there's a  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2220) there's a sort of because there's a  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2223) couple of reasons because this is sort  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2224) of an indicative of something more  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2226) fundamental  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2227) so either  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2229) um depending on who the person is either  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2230) you haven't really  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2232) built the foundations for yourself very  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2235) strongly so that when things do come  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2237) along they affect you quite a lot and it  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2239) upturns you your worldview is affected  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2242) quite strongly  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2243) and sometimes it can be because if  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2245) you're uh if you've been if you're you  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2248) know born into Islam you've been  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2249) complacent about the the learning or  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2251) you've come into Islam uh very  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2254) intellectually and you haven't really  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2256) laid your foundations yet  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2258) um something else comes along and it  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2259) kind of rock you quite strongly and  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2261) that's probably the indication that you  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2262) know let that sit down and work out why  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2266) you believe what you believe and where  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2267) you've established sort of your  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2268) foundations from and and get sort of  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2270) learning get yourself spiritually strong  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2272) and then you can move into these areas  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2273) of looking at things  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2276) um the other thing that might be a  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2277) personality thing so I I mean lots of  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2279) people are very anxious and little  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2281) things can sort of make you suddenly  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2283) um you know it can make you very anxious  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2286) about everything so a small anxiety  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2288) becomes a big anxiety sort of it's sort  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2290) of a ripple effect starts affecting  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2292) other things  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2293) and so I suppose it depends on who you  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2295) come across but it sometimes it can  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2297) declare things that need to be dealt  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2299) with um and this is a nice way to find  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2300) out you don't want to find yeah live  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2302) stream having a nice chat with someone  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2304) who cares is probably the nice way to do  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2306) it mashallah and uh this is the thing as  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2309) well like you like I I can't even count  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2312) how many people I've spoke to privately  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2314) but you start to see certain patterns  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2316) and it like you you recognize that there  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2318) is this intimate relationship between  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2320) the heart and the mind like there isn't  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2322) this big wall between them like people  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2324) try to make out  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2326) um it's you know they are connected and  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2328) that when your heart is affected that  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2331) does affect your ability to reason and  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2333) we know this because uh when people are  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2336) heartbroken for example they do very  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2338) very stupid things thinking that they're  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2340) completely rational mashallah we've got  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2342) brother in the back  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2343) he's giving us a little wave just give  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2345) us um I'll tell you what I'll just  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2347) bringing salam alaikum Bella  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2349) yeah  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2352) brother Yusuf brother Imran how are you  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2356) good how are you  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2359) alhamdulillah I was I I like it it  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2362) really picks my interest uh the the  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2365) point you were uh trying to explain to  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2367) the brother in the chat  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2369) uh about all the existence and the  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2371) non-existence and uh and uh it brought  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2375) me to think about uh about this verse in  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2379) the Quran  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2380) where uh uh Allah  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2383) uh says that uh uh let me read it in  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2388) English because I don't memorize it in  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2389) English so it says we did we did indeed  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2393) offer the trust to the heavens and the  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2395) earth and the mountains but they refused  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2397) to undertake it being afraid thereof  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2401) but men undertook it he was indeed  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2404) unjust and foolish  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2407) so when we look at this verse when we  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2410) talk about the other reality uh because  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2414) in the Quran God says that that uh  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2421) that means after we die it's like a  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2424) cover gets a veil from our eyes and our  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2426) vision becomes so strong we get to see  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2428) some things that that that we couldn't  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2432) see or we could we saw blurry when we  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2434) were alive yeah and uh so so what I  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2438) meant uh by uh uh uh uh mentioned in the  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2442) first verse is that everything that God  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2444) created  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2446) worships him with no condition with no  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2449) choice  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2450) and God gave us that trust to where we  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2455) will have a choice in life when we say  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2458) insane is  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2461) given a choice to actually uh make our  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2466) own decision  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2467) for for a brief period of time in this  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2470) life  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2471) are we going to worship God or not and  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2474) we said that we will because God uh  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2477) explicitly explained to us that we have  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2480) made this choice we have decided to  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2482) undertake this uh this this this  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2485) challenge because a lot of the atheists  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2488) keep saying why is God unjust what would  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2491) he punish us for a test that that he  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2493) know we're gonna fail  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2495) and uh and it's not true because God is  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2498) telling us that we chose this test and  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2500) he tells us that we were transgressors  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2502) and unjust and foolish for choosing to  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2505) take this test and the reward from this  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2508) test is so great we we're going to be  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2510) raised to uh to such a high position  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2514) from passing this test and now that we  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2518) are at this moment in life we are  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2520) already in the test we can't see anymore  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2523) like the way I try to describe it to  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2525) some friends when I talk about this  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2526) topic  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2527) if you're familiar Brothers with the  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2529) with the virtual reality when you put on  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2532) those goggles and you can see all these  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2533) things around you  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2535) yeah I tell them I tell them imagine  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2537) that you put on the reality goggles  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2540) virtual reality goggles and then there  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2542) are all these uh electrodes that are  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2545) attached to your uh to your skull and uh  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2548) so you can feel everything around you to  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2551) the point where it's like so real you  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2553) can feel things you can taste things you  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2554) can  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2555) and right before you put the goggles on  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2558) you're told that this is a tough test  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2561) that once you're immersed in that in  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2563) that uh virtual reality  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2566) you will forget everything that's around  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2568) you on the outside world like people  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2570) standing around the new around you  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2571) watching  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2576) oh did we lose you  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2579) brother are you still there  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2582) oh oh I'm sorry brother oh I'm sorry  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2586) sorry I I realized what happened so I  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2588) said once you're in that once you have  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2590) the goggles on you will be so immersed  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2592) in that reality that you would not know  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2595) or see or feel what's going on outside  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2598) of you like there are people standing in  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2599) front of you watching on the screen what  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2602) you're doing and what you're what you're  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2604) saying and everything  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2605) and but you have no contact with that  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2608) and you don't realize what you what are  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2610) you doing until you remove the goggles  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2612) so what are you doing the test people  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2614) are standing around and you're around  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2615) you are looking at the screen and say oh  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2617) my God I can't believe you just stole  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2618) something  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2619) oh my God he just he just took that that  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2622) uh Haram meet and put in his mouth and  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2625) part of the test is that poor kid he  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2627) can't eat pork it's it's just part of  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2630) the test it's not because because God is  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2632) unable to make us eat pork it's part  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2634) parts of the test like don't eat pork  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2636) once you have the gargle these are the  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2637) rules don't do these things do these  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2639) things and we find out that within when  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2642) we have the goggles on all these things  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2644) that are supposedly Haram for us and  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2646) Haram for a reason within that test not  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2649) within the the greater reality within  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2652) that test like they harm us when we do  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2655) when we do all these harambics they  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2658) could even just simply be because of um  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2659) a test of obedience  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2662) because exactly I'm I'm doing a video at  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2666) the moment for yesterday and I think  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2668) it's your recent one  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2669) um the non-believer believes in the  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2671) fitra  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2672) part one and  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2674) um there's a moment where  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2677) you're discussing something with him  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2680) and it's about the Apple I think  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2683) and like the Abbas is talking about that  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2686) like the apples in and off itself is  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2688) like this arbitrary object yeah I  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2691) remember it's like you know like who  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2693) cares about apples like what what is it  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2695) about this apple it's nothing about the  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2697) Apple in and off itself  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2698) but there's there's this whole notion of  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2701) like no you're being commanded to do  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2702) something  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2704) um like are you going to like be humble  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2707) and understand the position that you're  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2708) in in relation to the one that's  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2709) commanded you  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2711) um that you're ignorant you're finite  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2712) your leave and he is all knowing he is  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2715) wise and he's uh that not finite he's  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2719) infinite and you know there's obviously  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2723) a humbleness in that and there can be a  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2724) you know we refer to it as a Slip but  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2727) this forgetfulness and it's sort of  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2728) linking it to what you were saying as  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2730) well you know the virtual reality  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2731) goggles  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2732) and the the veil now it's funny because  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2735) like inshallah I can't take the veil off  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2738) you completely  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2739) but  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2741) there is a way of like peeking behind  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2745) certain layers and you can do it right  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2746) now yeah because we this happens all the  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2748) time we become very forgetful  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2750) and we become very soaked in to things  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2754) outside of us or to a particular task  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2757) and it's it can be quite remedial maybe  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2758) it's the stream  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2760) um maybe it's you're doing the dishes or  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2761) whatever but like life just sort of  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2763) captures you sometimes and you get stuck  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2765) in it and you just sort of go from one  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2767) thing to the next mindlessly almost  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2770) and it doesn't have to be like that like  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2772) right this very second yeah we can look  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2776) at how weird the universe is like it's  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2780) really really strange and you know like  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2782) people we mentioned in the virtual  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2784) reality goggles when they first came out  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2787) we were putting them on and we were  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2788) getting Shivers yeah we were like whoa  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2790) look at this this is weird like watching  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2792) like floating above Earth and things  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2794) like that and we like we'd be so amazed  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2797) by it and then we take them off and like  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2800) all we could think about was our  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2802) experience inside that virtual reality  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2803) goggles and we're looking at something  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2805) that is like more than 8K 50 billion K  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2809) like everything you see in reality  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2811) it isn't reducible to just a certain  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2814) number of pixels that you can do on a  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2815) screen yeah because that's all the  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2817) screen is it's just a number of pixels  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2819) and it's limited to however many well we  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2821) can get 8K now like a big what like the  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2824) universe can be broken down into a tiny  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2827) tiny particles so this is like  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2830) if it's a k anything it's a big big  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2833) number yeah there's so much detail in  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2836) the universe that it is completely  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2838) incomprehensible like every like even  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2841) like something simple like a maggot yeah  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2844) pretty arbitrary little  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2846) stupid little thing just Wiggles about  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2848) eats stuff and cocoons itself like in  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2851) that there is so much complexity and  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2854) weirdness there's so much like to just  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2857) sit and be in awe of but we just we get  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2860) soaked into day-to-day stuff so much  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2863) should we be combined to it like the  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2864) like the things that you have in your  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2866) house your washing machine these lights  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2868) these computers like I'm talking to you  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2870) I'm in a room we're not with each other  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2872) I'm not sat next to you I don't know  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2874) where you are I don't know but it runs  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2876) in London somewhere I don't even know  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2878) where in London but like all of these  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2880) ads are coming together  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2882) through through what through internet  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2884) waves whatever that is there's signals  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2886) information flying through the sky and  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2889) like we're all having this mad  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2890) conversation  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2891) and half of the time like the the  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2895) craziness of reality just completely  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2896) passes Us by but all it takes is just to  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2898) sit there and look at it and think about  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2899) how weird everything is  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2901) and all of a sudden that veil's gone for  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2904) a moment just just for a second like how  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2907) strange is everything how like how many  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2909) things are there that I should be like  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2910) in or off and be grateful for like you  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2913) know the go-to one is usually eyesight  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2915) like yeah like you when you've got your  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2918) eyesight and you're just using it you  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2920) take it for granted you're not like  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2922) I can see you're not like crying every  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2924) day because of the beauty of color I  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2927) gotta you know on a bright summer's day  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2928) when it the Sun comes out and the sky is  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2930) blue and all the vegetation is green and  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2933) the light just hits it perfectly and  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2935) it's like wow look at that like how  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2937) often like you should be constantly in  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2939) tears because if that was when like when  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2942) you get something in your eye and or  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2944) like you know something hurts or  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2946) whatever like when that's taken away  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2947) from you  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2949) all of a sudden you're like oh I wish I  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2951) had it I wish I had just appreciated it  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2953) when I had it oh you know same with good  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2955) health when we're in good health we just  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2957) take it for granted and then all of a  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2959) sudden we feel sick and then we're like  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2961) oh I've only if only I could get good  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2963) health again and then you get it again  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2964) it's like Allah Allah says in the Quran  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2966) you're like uh mankind screams for help  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2969) when he's on a sinking ship and then  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2970) when he gets what he wants and he he  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2972) gets dry land  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2974) it's like he never had any problem like  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2976) he never called to Allah at all and he  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2978) just calls about his day because mankind  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2980) is forgetful mankind  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2982) you know just get sucked into the  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2983) day-to-day and like as much as I can  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2985) maybe draw attention to the weirdness  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2987) you know  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2989) you know brother I'm sorry the point you  
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2991) made is like uh it's so good it actually  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2994) it reminds me of of this uh this idea  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=2998) that I get and and God forbid I mean to  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3001) uh to say that this is how creation was  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3005) uh uh by no means but let's just pretend  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3009) of sake of pretending and this virtual  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3012) reality what you're gonna put on the  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3013) goggles but you will be judged for what  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3016) you did while you had the goggles and  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3018) the the those electrodes and uh and uh  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3021) your memory was wiped off from the real  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3023) reality where you only witness and  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3026) experience things within that virtual  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3028) reality but before you put on the  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3030) goggles  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3031) you're told that once you enter that  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3034) reality there will be some things that  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3037) will work for you and some things that  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3039) will work against you for example for  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3041) example if you're a man and you're  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3043) extremely handsome it would be a  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3044) Temptation in that world and it will  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3046) cause you maybe to to attract uh uh  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3049) other women and uh and and cause you to  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3052) sin and maybe if you are very rich then  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3055) that money will be a Temptation and you  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3058) will be doing all things that will cause  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3060) you to sin and and uh if you're very  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3063) strong you're gonna have the the duty to  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3066) protect the weak and stand for what is  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3068) right and what is just and what is all  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3070) these things we're going to be judged on  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3072) and after the game is over  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3075) so now if you're selecting your uh your  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3079) tools for the game  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3081) and you're wise you're probably gonna  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3083) say you know what I don't want to be  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3084) very rich I don't want to be very  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3086) handsome I don't want to be very strong  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3089) I don't want to be very deaf because  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3091) you're trying to limit that Temptation  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3094) that might cause you to lose the game  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3095) but then once you decide all that and  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3098) you put on the goggles then all of a  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3100) sudden you're complaining you were like  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3101) you're like I wish I was I was I was a  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3104) very handsome man I was I wish I was  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3106) very strong I wish I was very rich this  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3109) is not fair God is not fair wisely or  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3111) the the the game Lord is not fair why  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3114) isn't he why is he giving this guy a  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3115) villa and a boat and this and uh and uh  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3119) uh private jet and like I'm struggling  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3122) to pay my rent and  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3124) so yeah people sometimes as well we we  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3127) get sucks into the problems that we have  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3130) you can't and then you draw a line  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3132) around that problem  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3133) and say I cannot see why this would  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3136) happen to me  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3137) and half of the time like a bit of time  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3141) makes that line that you've drawn around  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3142) the problem dissolve like when I was  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3145) younger certain things happened to me  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3147) when they were happening I was like oh  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3148) you know how could it be and you put a  
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3151) bit of distance between you and it  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3153) and it has less of an impact on you and  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3156) that line can be drawn a bit further you  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3158) go okay maybe I can see why that could  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3161) have happened to me or what consequences  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3163) came from that that may have been good  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3165) or what consequences were taken away  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3167) from me because of that thing  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3169) um whatever it is like there's so many  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3171) things that you can conceive of if you  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3172) just give yourself a chance to sit down  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3174) and think about these things because  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3176) this is the thing like the biggest links  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3179) to like the problem of evil and people  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3180) are complaining about the evil that has  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3182) befallen them they say I think it is  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3184) gratuitous I think there is no good  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3187) reason why this happened but it's like  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3189) do you know that do you know that for  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3192) sure because in order to say that you  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3193) have to have all the facts you need to  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3195) know how this event interplays into  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3199) everything around you yeah not just you  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3203) in that particular moment but you as an  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3206) individual throughout an entire life you  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3208) as an individual who has interactions  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3210) with your environment and the people  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3211) around you and how it impacts and  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3213) affects them  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3214) and can you say that you know  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3217) without a shadow of a doubt that there  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3220) is no wisdom behind it and the answer to  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3222) that question is no you do not know  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3224) without a shadow of a doubt and it's the  
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3226) same lesson is taught in uh sort of calf  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3229) with Musa when he's with uh  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3234) I don't know if I'm repeating myself to  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3236) the same people or if this is a  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3238) different circumstance but  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3240) um yeah what happens is he has these  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3243) natural reactions you know he thought it  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3246) does something and he's like  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3248) why are you doing that and he's like the  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3251) intuition is this is an unjustice why  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3253) would you do this and he says I told you  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3254) you couldn't be patient with me and he's  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3257) like ah yes and he humbles himself and  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3259) he realizes I'm jumping to conclusions  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3260) maybe I am ignorant of some facts that  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3263) would make me understand what is going  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3265) on here and in the end that's exactly  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3267) what happens that circle around the  
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3269) immediate environment is what's  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3271) happening when he he damages the boat  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3273) most of Allah's reaction is I am putting  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3275) a circle around this moment around this  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3278) event with me and you in this boat and  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3281) I'm not thinking beyond that  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3282) and in that Circle within this limited  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3285) context that I've artificially forced  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3288) upon the moment  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3289) that is an injustice it's like well hold  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3292) on a second  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3293) comes along and draws a bigger circle is  
[0:54:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3295) a Big King coming about  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3298) he's gonna be taking everyone's boats  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3299) and he's not going to take this ball if  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3301) there's a little hole in it and that's  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3302) going to save this family and that might  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3304) have a huge impact God knows on how many  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3306) generations that came after that  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3309) The Butterfly Effects you know a little  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3311) butterfly can flap its wings one minute  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3313) and that can have huge implications  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3315) thousands of years down the line and you  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3318) look at not Ali salami one family and we  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3320) all come from him  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3322) so you know these things can have huge  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3325) impacts the little things insignificant  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3327) things you're complaining about things  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3328) that are  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3329) um really important to you in that  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3330) moment  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3331) but there could be a tiny thing like  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3332) maybe you put the glass in there instead  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3335) of there or you know you you drank this  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3337) tea instead of that tea or you put too  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3340) many sugars or not or nothing like all  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3342) of these things have God knows how many  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3343) count  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3344) um  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3347) consequences  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3348) and you we cannot go ahead and talk  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3351) about these things as if we we know that  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3353) they're gratuitous because we just  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3355) simply don't but um I'm gonna have to  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3357) leave it there brother so I'm gonna have  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3358) to  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3377) prompt you to that question about the um  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3380) teenager yeah was that the one you're  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3382) gonna ask yeah so can you help a  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3383) confused teenager so if she's 18 and  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3387) over she can use a service if she's not  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3389) someone that she knows who is 18 or over  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3392) can use a service and we can talk to  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3394) them and then they can relay the  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3395) information or try to help so this is it  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3398) the way we work is we're not just  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3400) helping individuals that are suffering  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3401) through the problems themselves we're  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3403) trying to equip people who know  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3405) individuals who are suffering through  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3407) problems to help them to deal with it so  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3410) basically to help equip you do the job  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3412) that I do or the doctor Imran here like  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3415) and it's not impossible like we I wasn't  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3419) even a Muslim Once Upon a Time  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3421) um so you know if I can do it you most  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3423) certainly can  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3425) um and half of the time it's just you  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3427) know trying to get through certain  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3430) assumptions that people make like the  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3432) amount of times that someone's come in  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3434) with an argument and you're like well  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3436) hold on like  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3438) in order to say that with so much  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3440) the conviction  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3443) with so much confidence you've got to  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3445) say you know about XYZ and I guarantee  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3447) you don't think you know about XYZ at  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3449) all and um so yeah so but then he says  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3453) uh she is a woman if she's already age  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3456) 18 she's more than welcome to use the  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3457) service you can send this link  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3459) um to her I'll put it in the chat just  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3461) forward it and she's more than welcome  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3463) to make use of that  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3467) um but yeah so are you going to add to  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3468) that as well brother no I was just going  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3470) to add to the really I think the thing  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3473) the thing that's really important for me  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3475) as because we all suffer in our lives is  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3477) sort of just part of living yeah and the  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3480) thing to remember well the thing that I  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3481) try to remember is actually you know  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3483) for every individual is important to  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3485) Allah nothing is insignificant and  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3487) nothing happens to us without some  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3489) meaning in it it's meaningful it's  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3491) important and it has some value  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3494) and we trust in Allah we believe that  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3496) there is some good outcome in anything  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3498) that we go through so  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3501) um I think for me that's always held me  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3503) because and what I've looked back on  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3505) difficulties that I've had  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3507) I've always learned actually you know  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3508) from this I learned these things  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3511) yeah and uh I don't I don't think I  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3514) would have learned them otherwise well  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3516) actually I was heading down a darker  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3517) path  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3518) and maybe maybe in a path that I  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3520) wouldn't have liked myself if I had gone  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3522) down that path and this event that  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3524) happened that stopped me and made me go  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3526) another way actually when I look back  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3529) I'm grateful for that yeah during the  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3531) time I was going through that it was it  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3532) was a nightmare yeah yeah  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3535) so there's always a there's always a  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3538) hikmah that maybe we don't know and this  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3539) is the this is the moral underneath the  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3541) story of the of Islam that we we don't  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3543) know we don't know  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3545) and so we can't make Hasty judgments  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3548) yeah exactly and sometimes it is just  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3551) like putting a bit of effort in or  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3554) having patience because sometimes like  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3556) because I've had conversations with  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3557) people and they're so annoyed about  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3560) something  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3561) and it's like oh like the gratuitous  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3563) evil again yeah so  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3565) like so they say why do bad things  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3567) happen to animals it's like can you not  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3570) think of a single reason why like I'll  
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3572) give you a random thing and I want you  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3574) to try and tell me why you think this  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3577) event might have happened or what  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3579) potential reasons you might not get the  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3581) right answer but if you can think of at  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3582) least one yeah  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3584) and you can always think of more than  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3585) one but if you can think of at least one  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3587) you have at least a potential reason or  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3589) a wisdom behind that so the the example  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3592) I gave was um  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3594) the  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3595) a baby deer burning in a forest  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3598) it's like you know get the baby violin  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3600) out it pulls on the heartstrings poor  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3603) little deer why did it burn to death in  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3605) the forest and it's like okay yeah no  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3608) that does that sounds terrible doesn't  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3610) it like why would a baby deer just die  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3612) in the forest so think about it can you  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3615) think of any potential reason at all as  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3618) to why could have died maybe it was  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3620) having a disease  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3622) that had it been allowed to continue to  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3624) live might have spread and killed x  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3626) amount of people that may have been good  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3627) and there may have been great benefit in  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3629) them  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3630) um it could have been uh heading  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3632) straight towards a road  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3633) at some point in its life ran in front  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3636) of a car and killed a family of  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3637) beautiful people you know it could have  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3639) done X it could have done like there  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3641) could have been any number of reasons as  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3644) to why it happened  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3645) yeah and all of a sudden it's not  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3647) gratuitous now if I can give these  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3649) reasons  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3650) like you could of course you can object  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3652) to them if you want to but there are  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3654) still reasons there and the objection is  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3656) only again going to take you so far  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3658) because you you know you're limited in  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3659) your knowledge you don't they could that  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3661) could play the whole butterfly wing  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3663) thing there could be massive  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3665) consequences with letting this  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3667) particular thing happen or not happening  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3668) and it's just  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3670) just putting that effort in like just to  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3672) think and say okay  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3674) I will make an attempt here to try and  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3676) see if there is a reason in it and  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3679) looking for it is enough sometimes just  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3680) to reveal it to you and I've heard a  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3682) beautiful Dua I can't remember who told  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3684) me  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3685) um  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3686) I don't know if it's like a proper Dua  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3688) that we we get from the religion or  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3689) something but I heard someone say it and  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3692) it was um oh Allah don't give me an easy  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3695) life give me the strength to overcome  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3698) a difficult one or it may they may have  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3701) taken it from something else and  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3702) combined it with something but like  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3704) because within is the Islamic religion  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3707) as well we have this notion of this  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3708) concept that that pain isn't a bad thing  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3712) that like Allah says that he will test  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3715) the ones he loves over and over and over  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3717) and over again until they walk along the  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3719) Earth without sin yeah every no matter  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3721) what it is that you go through anxiety  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3723) hardship even the pricking of a thorn  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3725) that Allah will expiate your sins  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3727) because of it and on the day of judgment  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3729) you'll sit there and you'll see these  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3731) sins falling off your pile  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3733) and and you'll be told this is because  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3735) you suffered this with patience this is  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3737) because you suffered this with patients  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3738) and you'll be sitting there wishing  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3740) you'd suffered more  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3742) wishing you suffered more and the the  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3744) other Hadith about the the person who  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3746) had suffered has taken and he's not even  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3748) in Paradise he's just dipped in it like  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3751) a part of his body for a brief moment is  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3752) in there and he's asked did you ever  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3754) suffer and he said no this isn't  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3756) inconceivable because you see this  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3757) happening on earth when people  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3759) experience Joy they forget whatever pain  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3761) they've gone through someone wins the  
[1:02:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3763) lottery all of a sudden ask a mother  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3765) who's just delivered yeah like the  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3768) amount of like emotions they go through  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3770) the joy all of this like everything else  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3772) just drifts you forget about it no  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3774) matter what you've suffered like I've  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3775) got scars on my face I don't know if you  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3778) can even see  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3778) from when I fell down the stairs when I  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3780) was one I can't even remember that pain  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3782) yeah I like I have no I I only know  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3786) about it because I've got a scar there  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3787) that reminds me that that must have hurt  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3789) but and there's things that I do  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3790) remember happening like I've got scars  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3792) here I remember putting my arm through a  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3794) window  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3795) I know that hurt but I don't remember  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3797) the pain  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3798) like my arm doesn't hurt anymore it's  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3800) just  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3801) it's just a scar  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3803) you know it's just a memory it's  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3805) something that floats away it's like  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3807) looking at it through a fog and you know  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3809) if this can happen in the Dunya  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3812) with little trifling pieces of pleasure  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3815) and joy that you can forget everything  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3817) all of a sudden imagine like Allah is  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3820) describing there's a book that I'm  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3821) reading at the moment  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3835) I can't remember I'll put it  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3837) it's uh here it is  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3839) a concise description of Jannah and  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3841) Janam come on  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3843) and  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3845) basically it's you know it does what it  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3847) says on the tenant gives you a concise  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3849) description of Jannah and Johanna and  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3852) Jannah is described  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3854) in such a way yeah that  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3857) like it's it's inconceivable like the  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3860) the type of joy that you're going to  
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3862) experience the type of bliss that you'll  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3864) have when you get to Jannah yeah if the  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3868) lottery can make you forget what you've  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3869) gone through the lottery is like  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3872) absolutely nothing in compared to this  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3875) infinite Bliss infinite Joy forever no  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3878) boredom no tiredness no uh you know like  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3882) like in the on the earth if I play a  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3884) game too much I get bored of it ah we've  
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3886) got to move like no like in general  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3888) there's no lower diminishing return like  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3890) every time you've returned to something  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3891) the next experience conceivably could be  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3894) better than the last time you did it so  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3895) and that could just just keep doing that  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3897) forever like every time you go back to  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3899) the game you're like wow that's good  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3901) it's even better than the last time like  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3903) you know all these laws could be  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3905) completely inversed where people like  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3907) people say oh won't you get bored in  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3908) heaven for an infinite amount of time no  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3910) we only get bored on Earth because we're  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3912) wired to get bored  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3914) but isn't it's not you know  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3916) inconceivable that that wiring could be  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3918) completely changed so that that boredom  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3920) just doesn't ever hit you in fact the  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3922) opposite you get more and more like and  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3925) you you think you've hit a peak you're  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3926) like how on Earth can it get any better  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3927) than this imagine drama me and you yeah  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3930) roaming around playing real life Call of  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3933) Duty or Battlefield or something like  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3935) you shoot me when I die I respawn and  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3938) then like we're all running about  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3940) killing me we get to do what we want  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3942) like subhanallah  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3944) whatever you're going through whatever  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3946) it is you're going through you're gonna  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3947) forget  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3950) those in shoulder I mean I mean but  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3952) we'll leave it there do you want to give  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3956) a little closing statement before we we  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3957) end the stream  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3958) um I think I would just say that take  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3961) advantage of the uh of the service  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=3963) that's being offered at the Lighthouse

[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4178) causes a word or phrase temporary loses  
[1:09:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4181) its meaning that is what I've suffered  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4183) through  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4185) um

[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4191) in the Dunya is from Allah subhanahu wa  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4194) ta'ala  
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4195) I lost my hair at a young age and it  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4197) bothered me as an older man I realized  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4199) it was to protect me from my vanity  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4201) alhamdulillah everything is good for the  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4203) believer  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4204) everything is good for the believer if

[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4208) thankful he says alhamdulillah and so it  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4211) is good for him it is something if  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4212) hardship hits him if he struggles he's  
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4215) patient  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4216) and so it is good for him  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4218) Handler for everything  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4220) uh let's have a look  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4224) uh with regards to requests for Mohammed  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4227) hijab your best to just forward them to  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4229) his email  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4230) yeah you can find that on his YouTube  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4231) channel Insha'Allah and if he has the  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4234) opportunity to I'm sure he will  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4236) um  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4239) foreign  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4241) [Music]  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4244) being insincere when like you said we  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4247) can take the external world for granted  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4249) for the other Creator's existence yeah  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4251) if it's especially if it's a basic  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4253) belief like for example Allah says in  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4255) the Quran that we are made to testify at  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4257) the existence of the Lord before we are  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4259) placed into our bodies now belief is a  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4263) uh it's natural  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4265) it has to be and there's articles on  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4267) this you can search uh religion is  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4269) natural  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4270) by Paul Bloom he's an atheist he's an  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4273) atheist psychologist and you'll notice  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4275) the article isn't atheism is natural  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4278) uh it is specifically  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4281) theism is natural or religion is natural  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4284) people have certain beliefs and they  
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4286) have them as a basic belief and this is  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4288) why you have this cross-cultry wherever  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4290) you go there is a belief in the  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4292) Transcendent there is belief in life  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4293) after death there is belief in the body  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4295) and the soul  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4296) yeah there is belief in all of these  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4299) things and they according and this I  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4301) quote from um Paul Bloom they come for  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4304) free they are not learned so these  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4306) beliefs where do they come from  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4308) they try to obviously explain them via  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4310) naturalistic means but like I just see  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4314) absolute failure in their attempts to do  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4317) that and the belief in a higher power  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4320) belief in meaning belief in life after  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4322) death all of this makes complete sense  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4324) especially within an Islamic framework  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4325) Allah we've met Allah we've testified  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4328) that we believe in him and we're placed  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4330) in a body and we know that there is  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4332) going to be a Judgment Day  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4333) and why do think why do you think kids  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4336) believe in life after death without  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4337) having to be taught it this is the case  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4340) so it's a cross-cultural study that's  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4341) done all over the planet  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4343) um and this is the case even if the  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4344) parents uh atheists children believe  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4347) more readily in a secular environment  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4349) than adults do  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4356) and it is their parents that lead them  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4358) astray  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4360) of the society  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4361) but yeah we'll leave it there guys  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/r9bibL-z1Fo?t=4364) um
