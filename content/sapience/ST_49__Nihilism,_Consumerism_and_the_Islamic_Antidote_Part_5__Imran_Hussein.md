[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=16) video series in this episode we're going  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=18) to be looking at consumerism how it  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=20) links to nihilism and why it's such a  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=22) big problem now  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=23) let's go back  
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=25) a moment to the whole idea of the  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=27) enlightenment philosophers and thinkers  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=29) the idea that our objective is worldly  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=32) progress we have to create paradise on  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=34) earth  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=35) now this idea  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=37) obviously you know  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=39) has to result in something for for us to  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=42) attain a paradise on earth you know we  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=44) saw how the consumerist  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=47) ideology the consumerism as a way of  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=49) life was necessary to implement because  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=51) this is  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=52) now the system which is going to lead  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=55) to  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=55) what they think is going to lead to  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=57) prosperity and is going to lead to this  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=60) this this idea of a utopia a worldly  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=62) utopia now  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=64) i think it's important to define what we  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=66) mean or the difference between  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=68) consumerism and materialism as a way of  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=70) life they're used interchangeably  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=72) sometimes but there is a slight  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=73) difference as noted by tim kasser in the  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=75) high price of materialism  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=77) the consumer materialism as a way of  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=80) life  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=81) is  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=83) a an idea which is that  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=86) we as human beings we find value  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=89) through our material possessions and our  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=91) acquisition of  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=93) the material goods  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=95) value is attached to this this is  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=97) materialism as a way of life consumerism  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=99) is now if you like us acting upon this  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=102) ideology or this way of looking at  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=103) things so we go out and we consume and  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=105) we believe consuming material goods and  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=108) more products and all of these things is  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=110) going to lead to well-being and  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=111) happiness and it's going to lead to us  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=112) finding value and meaning  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=115) now how does consumerism or materialism  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=118) as a way of life linked to nihilism well  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=120) i'm sure you guys can connect the dots  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=122) and if you want take a moment pause the  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=123) video and let me know your thoughts in  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=125) the comment section below what you guys  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=126) think the link is between nihilism and  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=128) consumerism  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=130) so if you've done that one of the links  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=131) i want to share with you here is and  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=133) it's a very  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=134) simple logical point and that is that  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=135) when one finds themselves one finds  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=137) themselves in a state of meaninglessness  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=140) they realize life has no meaning what am  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=142) i here for what is it all about and they  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=143) can't find answers  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=145) the first place humans are going to turn  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=146) to  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=147) is the material world  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=149) and  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=150) on top of that if  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=152) the consumerist ideology and mindset and  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=155) you know has been pushed to us and  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=157) promoted to us everywhere well then  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=158) naturally we're going to hearken towards  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=160) it if we because that propaganda is  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=162) there you know and it's been there for a  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=164) very long time that  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=165) buying this attaining this having this  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=168) is going to lead to happiness it's going  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=170) to lead to well-being although there's  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=172) no direct correlation as we'll see in a  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=173) moment but this is what's going to lead  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=175) to happiness this is what's going to  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=177) lead to prosperity when we're being  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=179) bombarded with these messages especially  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=181) a human being that can't find meaning in  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=182) their life it finds themselves in  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=185) nihilism well then naturally they're  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=187) going to incline towards this  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=188) and on a level superficially when human  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=191) beings acquire things and buy things  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=193) especially if there's this  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=195) things in fashion if this atmosphere has  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=196) been created you know of of products  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=199) that you know  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=200) have gained been given this sort of  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=202) ephemeral value which we believe that  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=204) they have value and people are buying it  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=205) and there's social consensus on this and  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=207) everyone's inclining towards these  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=208) products which somehow in some way gives  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=211) these products value uh you know that  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=214) when we buy these things and we feel  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=215) like we're a part of that group now that  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=217) elite group that has a particular  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=218) product or you know has acquired  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=220) something it's gonna lead to a temporary  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=222) sense of fulfillment and happiness but  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=225) that runs out very quickly  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=227) because it's very ephemeral in nature  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=228) this type of happiness you buy something  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=231) you probably you probably experienced  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=232) this yourself you know we buy a product  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=234) we are aspiring to buy something we  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=236) spend months maybe years saving for that  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=238) thing we buy that thing we enjoy it for  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=241) a few weeks  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=242) a few days and then after that it's just  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=245) another product it's just another thing  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=247) that we we're just not finding that  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=248) satisfaction in it anymore that  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=250) happiness  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=251) we may live through others now we may  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=253) get other people to come and enjoy the  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=254) thing that we have so when they enjoy it  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=256) for the first time we live vicariously  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=257) through them now and they experience  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=258) this  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=259) or we may aspire to buy something else  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=261) now and we go and search for another you  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=264) know thing that we think is going to  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=266) bring happiness to us but it doesn't  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=268) so  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=269) nihilism and consumerism there is that  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=271) one link there and and the consumer  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=273) mindset if you are someone that has  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=275) taken materialism as a way of life  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=277) well then you're more prone to fall into  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=280) types of nihilism because all you're  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=281) focusing on is the material ephemeral  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=284) world which at bottom is meaningless  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=286) it's not going to give you value you  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=288) know it's not going to it's not going to  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=290) define you in any substantial way so  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=292) it's going to open you up to nihilism  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=294) you know so it swings the door swings  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=296) both ways  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=299) that being said what are the origins of  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=301) consumerism what was very interesting is  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=303) that  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=304) the origins of consumerism can be traced  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=306) back to also the time of the  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=307) enlightenment in 1732 for example  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=311) an author a physician i believe named  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=313) bernard mandeville he wrote a book  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=314) called the fable of the bees and this  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=316) was a very interesting tract what he  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=318) essentially  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=320) tried to do  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=321) was redefine  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=324) virtue  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=325) in his book  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=326) which at the time was understood you  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=328) know as someone virtues was someone that  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=330) was godly someone that was you know  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=332) lived a very simple life you know that  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=335) wasn't  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=336) engaged in vanity or you know buying all  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=338) of these things or someone that was  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=340) you would call a minimalist someone that  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=342) was focused on god in the spiritual life  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=344) as opposed to material life and what  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=346) mandeville tried to do was was turn this  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=348) around and suggest no  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=350) virtue  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=351) a virtuous person is someone who really  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=354) engages their desires and goes and  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=357) fulfills their material desires goes  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=359) engages in consumerism why his reasoning  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=362) was because the more you buy  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=364) you know you are facilitating for the  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=366) economy to increase and as the economy  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=369) increases in the long term you are now  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=372) bringing more money into the country  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=373) which leads to a safer country uh leads  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=376) to a more prosperous country and then  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=378) there's there's excess money to put into  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=380) you know  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=381) social projects you know increa you know  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=383) injecting money into hospitals and and  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=385) care and all of these types of things so  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=387) it was a very interesting idea  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=390) um which  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=392) was challenged by many philosophers and  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=394) some other thinkers like adam smith uh  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=396) in in the wealth of nations although he  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=398) didn't disagree with mandeville's  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=400) overall conclusion  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=402) uh  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=404) or reasoning what he did disagree with  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=406) was  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=408) specifically on consumption what should  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=409) be consumed to lead to this ultimate  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=412) goal what is it that we should be  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=413) consuming because according to mandible  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=414) it was just  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=415) it's just ridiculous  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=417) silly pointless things basically like  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=419) mirrors hats  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=421) certain items of clothing and you know  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=423) pottery certain you know brand names and  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=426) all these types of things he just wanted  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=427) you to buy whatever you know and and  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=429) fulfill your desires go and continuously  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=430) buy and just  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=432) gain as much as you can because at the  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=433) end of the day it's good because it  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=435) increases the economy it brings more  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=436) money in which will lead to good overall  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=438) uh but uh adam smith  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=441) tried to refine this and he said well  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=443) and he proposed well we should be  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=444) thinking of  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=445) you know let's make the things that we  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=446) consume more substantial and worthwhile  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=449) and meaningful and he proposed things  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=451) like education and the education system  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=453) and so on and so forth so it's a very  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=454) interesting discussion that was taking  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=456) place uh between these guys  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=458) interestingly during the same period  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=461) the enlightenment was taking place you  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=462) could say it was a part of the whole  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=463) process  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=465) but the idea is  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=466) consumerism especially today this  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=468) unhealthy type of consumer society that  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=470) we're a part of today  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=472) is directly linked to  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=474) the conception of the idea of creating a  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=477) paradise a worldly utopia you know  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=480) and at the same time what we've been  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=482) told is that this is what's going to  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=484) lead to happiness  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=487) well-being you know this is the idea  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=488) that's been pushed which is not the case  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=491) so the end of the day it's not about  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=493) individual well-being  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=494) although that's what's suggested and  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=496) that's what we learn it's about  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=498) money at the end of the day it's all  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=500) about money power and control at the end  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=502) of the day so there's a very interesting  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=504) quote here which i think summarizes this  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=506) whole consumerist system that we're a  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=508) part of  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=509) it's by lawrence shemsey in in his book  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=511) the hunger for more he states  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=513) consumption without excuses and without  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=515) the need of justification the beauty  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=517) part was that it finessed the irksome  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=520) question of values and of purpose during  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=522) the past decade many people came to  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=525) believe there didn't have to be a  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=526) purpose the mechanism didn't require it  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=529) consumption kept the workers working  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=531) which kept the paychecks coming which  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=533) kept the people spending which kept the  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=535) investors investing which meant there  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=538) was more to consume the system properly  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=540) understood was independent of values and  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=543) needed no philosophy to prop it up it  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=545) was a perfect circle complete in itself  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=549) and empty in the middle  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=551) very profound quote which i think  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=552) summarizes everything and by the way  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=554) you know this the people that were sort  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=556) of running or promoting this consumerist  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=560) ideology over the past several decades  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=562) century or so  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=565) again you can when you read what they  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=566) had to say you can start to pick up and  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=568) tell that human well-being was not  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=571) in this at the center of all of this it  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=573) wasn't about the individual for example  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=575) there's a quote here by victor level a  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=578) retail analyst from the 50s 1950s he  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=580) stated our enormously productive economy  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=583) demands that we make consumption our way  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=586) of life that we convert the buying and  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=589) the use of goods into rituals that we  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=591) seek our spiritual satisfaction our ego  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=594) satisfaction  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=596) in consumption we need things consumed  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=599) burned up replaced and discarded at an  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=602) ever accelerating rate  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=604) i mean you can see how shocking this is  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=606) right and what's really interesting just  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=609) as a side point  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=611) products are designed to break down it's  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=613) a part of the system so that we go and  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=615) buy more  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=616) there's cool it's referred to as  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=618) perceived and planned obsolescence or  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=620) some referred to as a psychological type  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=621) of obsolescence where products are  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=623) designed to have a certain shelf life  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=626) although they could be designed to last  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=628) much longer but they're designed to  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=630) break down so that the consumer goes and  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=632) buys another product take phones for  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=634) example you know  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=635) most phone companies these days come out  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=637) with a new phone every year what's wrong  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=639) with the old phone it's fine it's  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=640) working  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=641) but it's interesting because some  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=642) companies deliberately update software's  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=645) of the phone in a way that the phone  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=647) slows down starts to slow down at the  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=649) same time  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=650) they create this hype this propaganda  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=652) you know this need for this new upgrade  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=655) the next version  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=656) and we just we just buy it to this  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=658) advertising and we go and buy every year  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=660) and it becomes a social thing as well  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=662) where you become a part of this type of  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=664) elite group where you know everyone you  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=666) know in this group has the next phone  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=668) this year's phone i need to get it as  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=670) well to be a part of this group so it's  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=672) it's it's almost uh if you like you can  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=675) see it as psychological  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=677) warfare to a degree where they're trying  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=680) to create you're trying to create this  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=682) consumer because at the end of the day  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=684) it helps facilitate the system no it  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=686) doesn't lead to the well-being of the  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=688) individual  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=689) and and it's been achieved i mean we are  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=691) a part of a relentless consumer society  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=694) today  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=695) for example stephen mills  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=698) in consumerism as a way of life in his  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=699) publication he states consumerism is  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=701) ubiquitous and ephemeral it is arguably  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=704) the religion of the late 20th century  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=707) now this is  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=709) very very interesting that he refers to  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=711) it as the religion of the late 20th  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=713) century you know  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=715) that highlights that it's it's rampant  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=717) and it's widespread you know it's not  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=719) something that's been practiced by a  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=721) small group of people  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=723) now  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=724) hopefully this will give us a bit more  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=725) of an insight into the history of  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=727) consumerism and what it really is  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=731) in the next episode what we're going to  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=732) do is we're going to start looking into  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=733) the problems of consumerism why is it  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=736) really a bad thing you know fine we're  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=738) consumerists we live in a consumerist  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=739) society we buy things  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=742) okay fine there may not be a direct  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=743) correlation between well-being and  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=746) um you know consumerism but why is it  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=748) really a big problem and that's what  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=750) we're going to explore in the next  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=751) episode until then let me know your  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=752) thoughts in the comments section below  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=754) why do you think this modern consumerism  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=755) is a problem let me know your thoughts  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/6uD33MoU2SI?t=757) until next time salaam alaikum
