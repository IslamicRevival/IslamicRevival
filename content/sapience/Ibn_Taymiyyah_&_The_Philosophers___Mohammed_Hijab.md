## Summary of [Ibn Taymiyyah & The Philosophers | Mohammed Hijab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk)

### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=3600)

Ibn Taymiyyah was a medieval Muslim theologian who developed the Ashari movement. He argued that anything which is composed of parts is dependent, and that the human being is a rational animal. He also discussed the impossibility of finding a thing that does not exist and how this applies to the topic of the attributes of God. Finally, he argued that the logical syllogism does not allow for new knowledge to be gleaned from it.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=0)** Ibn Taymiyyah and the Hamburger School discuss the development of creedal discussions in the early days of Islam. According to Ibn Taymiyyah, there wasn't a lot of discussion about theological issues in the early days of Islam. After the Quran was revealed, speculative theology became popular, and Ahmed ar-Rawi used the Quran to argue for the existence of God.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=300)** Ibn Taymiyyah was a Muslim theologian who developed the Ashari movement, which opposed the Shadhiliya school of thought. He also wrote about the opposition fallacy.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=600)** Ibn Taymiyyah argues that anything which is composed of parts is dependent, and therefore necessitated by its corporeal counterpart.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=900)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses five ways that a thing can be taqib, or exhaustively identified. He argues that if a thing possesses material form, then it is taqib. He further explains that this is based on logic and Aristotelian philosophy.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=1200)** According to Ibn Taymiyyah, the human being is a rational animal, and the category of haiwan refers to that which is the actual human being. The subcategory of which is that he is the rational one. This is a construct that is mental in nature and has no bearing on the real world. The philosopher critiques the idea that one must first anthropomorphize the attributes of God in order to negate them, and argues that this is a problem.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=1500)** Ibn Taymiyyah argues that anything which is composed of parts is contingent, and that the universe is composed of parts. He also argues that the atheist cannot remain consistent with this position, as they would have to deny the universals.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=1800)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the impossibility of finding a thing that does not exist and how this applies to the topic of the attributes of God. He also discusses the nature of knowledge and how it is foundational for Muslims.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=2100)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses what he believes are the limitations of knowledge and the impossibility of knowing all things. He goes on to say that only the internal emotions of individuals can be known through the fitra, or "inner light."
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=2400)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses universals and how one can deny them. He then goes on to say that one can deny the universe and the extra mental world, and this is why he rejects them. Finally, he discusses how one can understand composition and how he deletes other definitions based on his backup histological positions.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=2700)**  Ibn Taymiyyah discusses how the existence of universals cannot be proven, and argues that they are conceptual analysis only. He goes on to say that the necessary existence of a universal must be a proposition, and that this is what Kant argued in his Critique of Pure Reason.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=3000)** Ibn Taymiyyah argues that the logical syllogism does not allow for new knowledge to be gleaned from it, instead it is just a way of expressing common sense notions. He also criticizes the definition of love, saying that it does not differentiate between platonic and romantic forms of love.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=3300)** Ibn Taymiyyah argues that there cannot be an infinite regress of causes, because if one causes an effect, then the possibility of that effect occurring must come from an earlier cause. This argument is used to defend the existence of God.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=3600) - [01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=5700)

 Ibn Taymiyyah discusses various philosophical concepts and how they relate to the existence of God. He argues that the concept of an all-powerful, eternal, and infinite God is logically impossible, and that any arguments based on this concept are invalid. He also discusses the relationship between conceptus and universals, and argues that although proposition is not existence, it's still necessary.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=3600)** Ibn Taymiyyah argues that the concept of an all-powerful, eternal, and infinite God is logically impossible, and so any arguments based on this concept are invalid. He also rejects arguments based on the idea that God is capable of creating things that endure forever.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=3900)**  Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the legitimacy of conceptualizing things and making arguments conceptually based on cosmological starting points. He argues that if you start with cosmological starting points, subsequent conceptualization is legitimate, but if you don't, it's not. The futura is not a strong argument for him, as it's not knowledge. He also discusses the relationship between conceptus and universals, and argues that although proposition is not existence, it's still necessary. Ibn Taymiyyah provides an analogy between Allah and the conceptus.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=4200)**  Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the philosophers and their arguments for the existence of God. One of the philosophers Ibn Taymiyyah discusses is Bertrand Russell, and his famous objection to the cosmological argument is that a part (i.e. a universe) might have a certain attribute (e.g. being existent), but the whole (the universe) might not have that attribute.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=4500)**  Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the philosophical concept of inheritance. He argues that if an object has a diffuser property – meaning it spans arbitrary subsections – it is inherited by the object in question. He also discusses the principle of diffusion, which states that the future property is one which spans arbitrary subsections.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=4800)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the principle that if adding one member of a set to another member yields a change in the judgment of the set, the judgment on the set will not be comparable to that of the individual members. If the judgment on the set does not change with the addition of the second member, the judgment on the set will be like that of the individual unit. An example of the first category is found in cases where the addition of one part of a set to another segment causes the entire set to become more intense. An example of the second category is found in cases where extension is from any direction and it does not have to be long. In this case, the judgment on the set cannot be like that of the individual unit.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=5100)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the principle of part whole differentiation, stating that it only occurs when there is an addition or subtraction involved. He also provides an example of how this principle can be applied in the real world.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=5400)** Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the principle of dependency, which states that the more dependent a thing is on other things, the more intense the dependency becomes. He goes on to talk about how this principle applies to the world of physics, where adding more and more dependent things together requires more and more energy. He argues that this is an empirical fact, not a philosophical one.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wShrJLpj0mk&t=5700)**  Ibn Taymiyyah discusses the argument for God's existence and how it cannot be based on compositional principles. He argues that something bereft of equality cannot produce it, and that this is supported by the Qur'an.

[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=8) welcome to the second session we'll be  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=10) exploring some theo philosophical issues  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=12) in fact we're going to go going into a  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=14) little bit more detail today on uh evan  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=18) tamiya and the hamburglar school and its  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=19) reaction particular to some of the  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=21) arguments for god's existence now why  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=23) this is important  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=24) uh is because obviously when we're using  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=27) arguments for god's existence we want to  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=28) be convinced that it's um you know it's  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=31) it's uh in line with the sunni like  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=34) orthodoxy  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=35) and as well as well as being voracious  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=38) so i'm going to be doing this with him  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=39) and tamiya and i'll be choosing an  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=41) ashrae scholar as well  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=43) who i think is going to be  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=46) because it makes sense that is him that  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=48) we do the same thing with in other words  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=49) we'll be looking at subjecting some of  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=51) the arguments of god's existence  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=54) to  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=55) some scrutiny but the scrutiny is not  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=57) from the atheistic interrogator this  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=59) time it's from  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=60) the theistic one  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=62) and so we'll start with the metemia and  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=64) we're going to be focusing in particular  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=66) on the issue of tarkip not least it's  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=68) because it actually has become somewhat  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=70) of a controversial topic  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=73) meaning composition it has become some  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=75) of our controversial topic especially  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=77) when there is arguments being made and  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=80) debates being had  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=82) in muslim people or theistic people and  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=85) atheistic people and it's important for  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=86) us to have this background so that i  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=89) don't for example or we don't as muslim  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=91) people when someone's put forward for a  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=93) debate  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=94) you know have all these attacks from our  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=96) own side which you know can be remedied  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=98) with some level of knowledge but also  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=101) because to be honest ebony mia has made  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=104) some really significant contributions  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=106) which tether and refine the argument  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=109) and he is  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=111) as you'll see scrupulously meticulous  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=114) imprecision  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=115) and  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=116) logical thought process so  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=119) we're going to be looking at  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=121) this might sound a bit overwhelming but  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=123) 10 distinct parts 10 yes distinct parts  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=126) of him tamiya's  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=129) or  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=130) you know there's going to be 10 distinct  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=131) parts of this particular session  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=133) the first part  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=135) is going to be an interleaving  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=138) section where we're going to be  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=140) connecting the dots with the previous  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=141) session that we had  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=143) and i'm going to be asking you guys some  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=144) questions about the hamburlite  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=145) development  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=146) uh particularly when you say hamburlai i  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=148) also mean here the the selif if you like  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=150) and all these kind of things so i want  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=152) to open it to the floor actually with  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=154) the first question  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=155) um  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=157) considering what was discussed last week  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=161) in fact before we start uh is alidawah  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=164) on the phone someone call him yeah  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=166) yeah it's fine you can keep that in the  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=167) snowball let's call him because i want  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=169) to see if he can  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=170) i can answer this question as well  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=172) considering  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=174) that which was discussed last week  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=178) how would you characterize  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=183) creedal discussions in the early days  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=187) well how would you characterize it  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=190) we're talking about the first 200 years  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=192) let's say  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=193) so like 2 300 years of islam not a lot  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=196) of discussion on like  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=198) the attributes of god and  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=200) the intricacies of them is very just  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=202) like  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=203) everything's on the prima facie kind of  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=204) thing okay just affirmation  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=208) so when you say not a lot of discussion  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=209) we're talking here about more  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=210) speculative discussion you're not  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=211) speculative theology  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=213) so there was you could say it was  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=215) characterized by even uh imam malik  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=218) basically it's like the height you could  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=220) say that you got to yeah okay but how  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=222) would you how would you finish the  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=223) sentence the first two to three hundred  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=225) years of islam in crude oil discussions  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=227) was characterized by what what kind of  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=229) approach absolutely okay you can call it  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=232) another approach what else would you  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=233) call it  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=235) uh tradition okay great a scripturalist  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=237) approach a traditions approach that's  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=239) good this is the correct answer yeah so  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=241) in the beginning there wasn't really  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=242) this long discussions you know  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=244) about um you know the speculative  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=247) theology and so on my question then is  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=250) what changed  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=252) who what were some of the turning points  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=255) that changed this game in the situation  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=257) here last week but just guessing yeah  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=258) yeah it seems to me that after the  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=261) came and decided to say that the quran  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=263) was created  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=264) uh people who aversed to speculative  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=266) theology like him ahmed himself yeah  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=267) wrote books like uh  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=269) i think yeah and then he kind of used  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=271) the same quran that he was against  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=273) to  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=274) i think what he said was that it was  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=276) necessary for us to now defend and speak  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=279) about that which we were quiet about  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=281) earlier well i'm happy you mentioned  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=283) that quote and that's a that's a good  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=284) characterization because i'll mention  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=286) exactly what he said i have the exact  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=288) quotation in translation in fact  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=291) uh  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=292) it can be retrieved from  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=302) people to be silent as well as to leave  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=304) off any indulgence in qaram  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=307) or issues relating to the quran's nature  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=309) but when we were called upon to do so it  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=311) became necessary to treat these issues  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=313) in need of further elaboration  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=315) as you correctly said i mean if you look  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=318) at  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=318) you know his first  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=320) treatise if you like  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=324) for example there's a major development  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=326) there in terms of the argumentative  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=328) method you know how he's he's arguing  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=330) now and talking about tanakh and and  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=333) contradiction and bringing these other  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=335) precepts in  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=336) place obviously we must also warn that  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=339) there is some level of discussion about  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=341) the this the authorship is  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=345) attributed to  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=346) or is it not attributed to him but  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=348) that's that's a separate discussion we  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=350) know is that dademy he was one of the  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=352) students and who came after him he did  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=354) actually he went all out in terms of his  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=356) response to the martessila as you  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=358) mentioned after the greek translation  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=359) movement uh in terms of you know using  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=362) argumentatively speculative methods you  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=365) know  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=366) and so on  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=367) uh but there's maybe some figures before  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=370) the martessilla or even the  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=372) proto-martial  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=375) who were who are mentioned in these  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=377) discussions who  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=379) maybe came across but you mean in the  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=380) first so you say second century who who  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=382) who am i thinking about him  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=387) yeah yeah  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=388) and and  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=390) who i mentioned  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=392) this is  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=399) but do we have any works of jam  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=401) or jad  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=403) i mean yeah that's why some may be more  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=405) skeptical members of the  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=407) western academic tradition also the man  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=409) didn't even exist i mean  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=411) we don't have anything  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=413) written i mean you know funny enough you  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=415) know who mentioned this in in brackets  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=417) in one of his works  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=419) he mentioned like you know  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=421) he wrote his phd on this kind of things  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=423) and he said  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=424) if the man even existed i thought that's  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=426) all  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=428) so anyway the point is is  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=431) surely  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=433) there was a development here but who  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=434) else is who are some some figures that  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=436) we discussed last week last week  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=440) yes even collab was uh somebody who came  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=442) before after  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=445) before him and  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=447) he was seen as some kind of a precursor  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=448) was he not to a shady movement who else  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=451) was seen as a precursor like that to the  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=452) movement  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=454) yes  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=455) yes and um do we have any real works of  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=458) him collab  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=460) we don't have any works of him collab  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=462) just like we don't have any works of  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=463) dirham or german safwan  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=466) and so we are relegated to  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=468) heroes theological texts  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=470) and heroes theology is basically ferax  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=472) you know this question of when people  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=474) write about the  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=476) the other they write about them in  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=479) uh they are the heterodox and they are  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=481) the orthodox so obviously this is why  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=483) it's called teresyology but we only know  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=484) by these people from their opponents  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=486) basically if you want to put it in  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=488) in that way but what has to be on the  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=489) other hand actually we do have text from  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=490) him we have manuals and stuff like that  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=493) sophie you know  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=495) some some of his books out you know and  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=497) so on  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=498) okay uh so then there was the  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=500) development of the ashadi movement which  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=501) we will talk about again maybe about  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=504) which happened after that  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=506) now  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=507) let's move on to ebentamia now what what  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=509) is interesting about when we spoke about  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=511) this last week well let's bring it uh  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=514) back to the for  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=516) what is interesting about ibn tamiya  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=518) give me a couple of things that make him  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=519) an interesting figure  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=523) he was somebody yes  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=526) yeah somebody who give me something more  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=528) substantive than that  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=531) or is interesting about him  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=533) for humbly  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=535) so he did use the column yes um  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=539) and  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=540) he gives  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=545) he gives  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=547) so going back to the continuous argument  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=550) uh  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=551) his arguments  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=552) to explain  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=554) uh for instance the  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=557) opposition uh fallacy yeah  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=560) even though it was back in uh centuries  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=562) ago and that's something that nobody did  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=564) before him from the hamilton school  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=565) right yeah  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=566) even even the most liberal members you  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=567) know you don't see that they were doing  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=568) something like that right so he was more  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=571) inclined with the  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=572) uh use of the canon yeah absolutely this  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=575) is that's correct answer i mean that's  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=577) what really distinguished him from the  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=579) the other hanabila the other people from  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=581) the hamburglar method that he was  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=582) indulged really in this thing as we're  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=584) going to find out i mean and this is why  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=586) it's almost untenable the position that  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=587) some people have some  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=589) hardcore scripturalists which we respect  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=591) their opinion i mean if you want to say  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=592) that you know just  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=594) obviously keep to a scripturalist  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=596) understanding we expect the conservatism  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=598) of of those individuals however if they  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=600) want to use a brintamia it's really it's  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=602) impossible almost to use him uh as an  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=604) evidence for for that kind of  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=606) scripturalism because as  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=608) we've seen here like you know the man is  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=609) going into discussions which  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=612) really beyond his time before his time  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=614) like you know  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=615) he making statements and about uh the  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=618) universals will come to the  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=620) compositional fallacy as we come to  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=621) uh you know and so on  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=625) okay  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=626) um  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=627) now what is taqib like before we talk  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=630) about the issue of that kim because this  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=631) is something which all the schools of  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=633) thor had some discussion about because  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=635) obviously  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=636) it's not just applicable to the  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=638) arguments for god's existence it's  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=639) actually applicable to god's attributes  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=640) as well so that's why there's a deep  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=642) intersectionality between  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=644) those two camps you know god's  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=646) attributes or the theological camp and  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=647) also the if you like the philosophical  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=650) camps so what what is tech how would you  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=652) understand what is taking exactly  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=654) uh  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=655) um yes go ahead tell us  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=658) direct translation would be composition  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=660) yes uh  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=662) so  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=664) i think it's pretty self-explanatory  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=666) right what uh what makes up something uh  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=669) in terms of attributes yeah in terms of  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=672) attributes of what makes makes up  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=673) something that's physical  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=675) non-physical attributes right okay so  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=676) what was even samia's gripe with uh use  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=679) uses of technique to keep argument by  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=681) cena yeah he he  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=683) he pointed out that  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=685) ibnecina's argument  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=687) for god's existence denies uh god's  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=690) attributes uh  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=691) so it does making like abrahamic  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=694) conceptions of god  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=695) untenable  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=697) beautiful excellent that's really well  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=698) put i'm happy with that that was a  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=700) correct answer in fact uh let's be more  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=702) specific here since you've given the  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=704) correct answer i will give you a little  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=706) bit more  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=707) uh  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=708) when it when it comes to this  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=710) in fact  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=713) before before i give you  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=714) maybe answer  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=716) let's talk about what even cena first  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=718) said so let's let's remind ourselves of  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=720) even sinister  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=722) you know you wouldn't see this bullhorn  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=724) argument or the contingency of god's  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=726) existence  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=727) you know an important aspect of it  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=730) which  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=731) uh  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=732) dealt with the objection of the  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=733) contingency of the universe is to keep  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=736) okay and obviously it's important  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=738) because  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=738) like the question is it's always going  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=740) to come to you why is the universe  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=743) not the necessary existence this is the  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=745) question that why is the universe not  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=747) the necessary existence why is the  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=748) multiverse not the necessary existence  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=751) because we're saying it has to be a  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=752) necessary existence yeah  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=754) so the question now is the atheists will  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=756) say okay why is it not the universe  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=758) itself why is it not the multiverse  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=759) you've got maybe  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=760) an infinite multiverse a limited  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=762) multiverse  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=764) so this is what i've been seeing that  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=765) saying he says that  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=767) and this is a translation it's not my  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=768) own  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=770) the book remarks and admonitions physics  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=772) and metaphysics  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=774) analysis and annotated translation  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=776) every cause of a totality that is  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=778) something other than its units first of  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=780) all  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=781) a cause of the units and then the  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=782) totality  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=784) okay  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=785) if this is so then let the units not be  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=787) in need of this cause then if the  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=788) totality is completed by its units  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=791) it will not need this cause either  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=793) rather a certain thing may be a cause of  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=796) some of the of the units  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=798) of the exclusion of some other others  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=801) such a thing is not the cause of the  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=803) totality in an absolute manner  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=805) if the essence of that whose existence  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=807) is necessary is composed of two or more  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=809) things that unite  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=811) it becomes necessary by them  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=813) one of these things or every one of them  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=816) will be prior to it and constituent  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=819) of it  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=820) therefore  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=821) that whose existence is necessary is  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=824) indivisible whether in concept or in  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=826) quantity so this is where  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=829) you know even tamiya will say we have an  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=830) in concept  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=831) hold on a minute what do you mean by  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=833) that yeah  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=834) or whether in concept or in quantity  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=837) everything whose existence is dependent  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=839) on a sensible body is necessitated by  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=843) that body and not by its own essence  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=846) every sensible body multiplies into  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=848) matter and form by quantitative division  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=851) and by conceptual division  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=853) again for every single for every  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=855) sensible body you will find another body  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=857) of its species  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=859) species he has like gins in arabic  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=862) or of another species it's not like  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=863) animals it's like you know the giraffe  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=865) and this and it's just in case  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=867) this is a specialized philosophical  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=869) jargon yeah if considered in relation to  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=871) its corporeality  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=875) thus every sensible body and everything  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=876) dependent on it is caused  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=880) uh shekhar what is he saying here  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=884) do you need a minute to think about it  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=888) is he basically saying that because i  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=889) know it's a bit of a mouthful yeah  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=890) that's right  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=892) anything which is composed of parts  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=895) basically is dependent  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=897) and  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=897) in the that paragraph that you read out  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=900) he goes on to kind of  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=902) explain the different ways that is so  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=904) that's a good way of doing it  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=905) uh yes obviously he's making a  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=907) cause-based argument here  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=909) the way we've refined it from the  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=910) institute here is that we've said that  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=912) it doesn't have to be a course based  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=913) argument  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=914) if we stuck to the strict  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=916) avicennian model  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=918) it would be a cause-based argument for  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=920) sure  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=921) but uh  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=923) he has made a cause-based argument  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=926) and he's clearly made a lot of  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=928) postulations now  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=930) let's go straight into ibn tamiya's  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=933) problem with it  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=934) and you'll find this even tell me his  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=936) issue with it  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=937) in a safari page 105 of the  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=940) i don't know what edition which you're  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=941) talking about here we'll maybe bring in  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=943) something beirut edition yeah muhammad  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=946) rashad salem edition  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=948) yeah 1985  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=951) page 105. so he he's saying on this  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=954) he is saying in samia  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=958) that there are five different ways that  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=959) taqib can be  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=961) exhaustibly identified  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=964) there's five different ways you can  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=966) think of composition  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=968) one of those ways  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=969) is  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=970) with liquidity  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=972) or another one is  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=975) general specific  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=978) ginsenoa these are all subdivisions like  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=980) a category and a subcategory  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=982) and i'll i'll under i'll make you  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=984) understand what this is that unciphat  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=986) the essence and the attributes of  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=987) something numerical multiplicity like  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=990) chem  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=992) and then he says as for anything  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=993) possessive of material form then it is  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=995) also taqib and these are the fourth and  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=997) fifth types  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=999) so we don't need to actually go into  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1000) detail as to all these things because it  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1002) would actually require some level of  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1004) logical background in arabic logic there  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1006) are these five coulee ethercamps  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1008) they're the five  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1009) universal things you know the gins the  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1012) noah the fossil  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1013) uh and wealth  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1015) no no  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1017) the the the  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1021) uh  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1031) myself right  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1033) that's what i was actually asking but  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1034) these uh these like the the gins is  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1036) the category the kulia the colliers are  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1039) the universals yeah there are five  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1040) universals someone can bring out would  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1042) be good actually  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1043) uh  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1045) actually i got it here i've got it in my  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1047) own writing you've got the gins the  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1048) genus the fossil the  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1050) specific difference there no other  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1051) species the arab the accident  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1054) and the hassa which is the property  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1057) when they say accident yeah in the yani  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1060) it's not like an accident like cars  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1061) smashing on each other  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1063) and an arad is basically something which  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1065) is real  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1067) and that is something which is  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1069) which i'll tell you what this means  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1072) no let me explain right so  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1075) a  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1076) an essence is something which is  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1078) subsistent within itself  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1081) where an accident or arad is something  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1083) which is not like for example a color  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1086) like red the red color this red color  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1088) yeah  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1089) redness is not something which exists in  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1091) of itself it has to have some object  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1093) which it inherits in in order to  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1095) instantiate  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1097) um  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1100) yeah yeah you can say so but they don't  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1102) translate it like this they translate as  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1104) accident i don't for some reason almost  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1106) everyone has agreed to this translation  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1108) in the philosophy of religion they  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1109) translate it as accident now why have  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1111) they translated as that i don't know  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1113) yeah but that is what a heart of this  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1116) okay  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1116) so as that is something which is  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1118) obviously the opposite of allah in a  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1119) sense that that an essence is something  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1121) which  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1122) exists in and of itself it does not  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1124) require something else to  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1126) to inherit within it in order to exist  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1130) yeah  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1131) so basically  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1133) if yani  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1134) is  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1135) and this is based on artillery and logic  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1137) yeah this is based on ours this this  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1139) this characterization the five thing is  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1142) based on the organelle and all these  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1143) kind of things based on logic  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1145) but the arabs took it on board and they  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1147) basically made something up and that  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1148) almost every logical textbook  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1153) and all that you'll find these five  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1154) there it's like you know it's very  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1156) important  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1157) thing  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1161) now  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1162) in terms of for example just to break  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1164) things up down for you  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1168) and this was in the aristotelian or the  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1170) hellenistic period but also it's in the  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1171) uh arab logic or whatever islamic logic  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1176) but it's written arabic and sometimes  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1177) persian as well these two languages  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1179) the written languages right  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1181) so in the islamicate  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1183) period whereas mostly written arabic and  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1186) persian  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1188) it would be  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1190) for  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1190) example uh that they would use the  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1192) example of the speaking and or the  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1194) rational animal al hayward  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1196) human being  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1197) is haiwan is an animal  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1200) yes  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1201) but it's also a rational act what  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1203) differentiates the human  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1205) from all the other species in this in  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1207) this sense i mean actual animals  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1209) all the other animals is his ration his  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1211) rationality the ability to  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1213) introspect his ask why  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1215) you know moral eyes and all these kind  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1217) of things  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1218) that's what differentiates a human being  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1219) from everything else yeah all the other  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1222) animals  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1223) so this so the the category is  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1226) that the main category is  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1228) haiwan  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1229) which is that who we are  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1231) in a ma in a category of haiwan  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1234) and the sub category is  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1238) which is that he is the rational one  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1240) so this is actually a construct he's  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1242) saying it's a construct  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1244) and damian is saying  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1245) well i'm not even the logicians would  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1247) say this is a construct we are a  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1249) construct of two things fundamentally  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1251) human beings are two things  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1252) fundamentally  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1254) they're human  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1256) oh sorry they are an animal yes and they  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1258) are rational and so this is a kind of  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1259) turkey  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1260) you understand this is a kind of  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1261) composition do you get it  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1263) even samia's saying yeah this is a  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1265) composition it's true but it has no  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1266) bearing on real life  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1269) it's only something which is composed in  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1272) your mind  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1273) it's like if i say think of a golden  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1275) mountain yani if you're thinking of a  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1277) golden mountain right now which is  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1279) probably something which is cannot  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1280) escape your mind right  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1282) if i say don't think of something yeah  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1284) and you'll think about even more think  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1286) don't think of a pink elephant  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1288) all you guys are thinking about pink  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1289) elephant is what you're thinking about  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1291) but it doesn't exist in the real world i  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1292) mean unless someone has put  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1294) pink paint on an elephant  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1297) or it has  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1298) some kind of disease on its skin  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1300) but i've never seen a pink elephant  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1302) you know  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1303) just because  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1305) you can think about it it doesn't mean  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1306) it exists that's what matami is saying  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1307) he's saying this  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1309) although mentally legitimate okay we're  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1311) not saying it doesn't exist in your mind  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1312) he's saying it doesn't there's no  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1314) actually such a thing as that yani in  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1316) the real world  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1317) so when you're saying that human being  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1318) is a rational animal  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1320) that's you're you're constructing these  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1321) two things together in your own mind but  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1323) it's not something which shani has any  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1325) bearing on any real world danny  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1327) situation do you see this and he goes in  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1330) in likewise format with all of these  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1332) different things so like for example  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1333) that was  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1336) or you said noah right but then he can  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1338) say the same thing applies with that and  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1340) sifat what is the actual  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1343) because one of the one of the criticisms  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1344) of the philosopher is that oh and the  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1346) more tesla actually as well is that you  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1347) cannot have to add  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1350) you cannot have um  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1352) many essences  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1354) so they ask the question  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1356) god is made up of so many attributes  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1358) right  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1359) he is al-rahman he is al-rahim he is  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1361) al-kawii he is  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1363) he has all of these things he is the  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1365) most powerful one he is the most  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1366) merciful one in all these things  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1368) but they say this is a kind of disguised  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1370) polytheism i mean that's how far they're  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1372) going when this is allah saying this is  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1374) what you talk about many gods a pantheon  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1376) of gods in one actually that's what  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1378) you're talking about but tamiya is  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1379) saying the only reason why you've come  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1381) to that conclusion yes  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1383) is because you've given each of those  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1385) attributes in essence  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1388) you see  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1389) he's saying that  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1390) really these attributes are they're not  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1392) all of these it's not pantheon of  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1394) different essences with their own will  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1396) and  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1397) center of consciousness coming together  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1398) he's saying therefore you're confusing  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1400) the categories here the reason why  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1402) you've decided to negate the attributes  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1405) of god is because you have  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1407) misconceptualized in the first instance  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1409) what this idea of taqib is so he was  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1411) very staunch against this point he said  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1413) you can't have this kind of turkey  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1416) you've already missed you'd have to  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1418) first anthropomorphize  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1420) the attributes of god  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1422) in order to there thereafter negate them  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1424) like that and this is a very legitimate  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1427) concern  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1428) i mean this is a problem if if  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1430) if one is saying  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1432) that the equivalent of things which are  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1435) made up of  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1436) pieces and stuff or which which he's  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1438) going to tell us what the the right way  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1440) is yeah but um  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1443) or something which is material and  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1444) susceptible to dissembly yeah  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1447) the equivalent of that is is like the  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1449) conceptual adding together of different  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1451) concepts if you're saying if you're  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1452) putting these two things on the same  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1454) level ontological status then here you  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1456) have an issue so he doesn't he doesn't  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1459) throw the baby with the bath water out  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1461) which is why  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1463) he says the following he says this is  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1464) the only legitimate type of keep  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1467) composition he says  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1469) and the phrase molecular composition is  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1470) meant to signify that was something else  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1472) has put together namely the being whose  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1475) parts were separated and then put  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1476) together or that which is susceptible to  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1478) dissembly  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1480) disassembly yeah this is what he's  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1481) saying and he mentions  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1484) page 116 yeah  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1486) and then he goes on to further say it  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1488) could be said that the intended meaning  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1490) of the phrase that keep is that there  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1492) are two parts which are separated and  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1494) then some composing agent appears to  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1496) have put them together which explains  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1498) why the term moroccan is passive  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1500) participants  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1502) this is just as food is made up of  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1503) various shares and portions garments  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1506) consist  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1507) segments of cloth medicines attain their  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1509) function from the various ingredients  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1511) and the like and this is also mentioned  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1512) in shorthand page hundred and twenty 171  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1517) so he's saying that basically for him  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1519) therefore the kind of taqib  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1522) which is acceptable  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1524) is only one kind  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1526) and that is something which is  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1528) susceptible to disassembly  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1531) that you can remove from it it's  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1532) susceptible to additional subtraction on  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1535) an empirical level  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1537) if something  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1538) can you can take away from it and put  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1540) put into it on an empirical level this  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1543) is  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1544) uh something which is moroccan is  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1546) composed  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1548) yeah so  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1549) if someone there is this is not he's not  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1551) saying this himself he's not making the  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1552) argument but if i were to make the  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1553) argument there which we do make anything  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1555) made up of composed parts and by that we  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1558) mean  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1559) think something which is  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1560) susceptible to disassembly  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1563) if something is made up of therefore  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1564) that thing is contingent the universe is  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1566) made up of  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1568) of that  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1569) of uh pieces or composed parts  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1572) therefore it's it's contingent nanny  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1574) that this wouldn't go against him yeah  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1576) do you see the point here they tell me  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1578) they're saying actually this the only  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1579) problem i have is the problem with  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1582) a composition of different attitude  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1583) attributes and and if you're if you're  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1585) using the conceptual  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1587) not this definition in fact he's the one  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1589) who offers this definition  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1592) so a lot of what we're seeing today is a  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1593) lot of people come and say well you  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1594) shouldn't use this argument because it  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1596) goes it will literally it will lead to  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1598) negating their  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1599) attributes  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1601) we say only can lead  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1604) to negating the attributes if what for  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1606) the first definition  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1608) if we go for any of the other  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1609) definitions  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1610) other than even tell me his definition  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1613) which is what  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1614) that  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1615) uh  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1617) some  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1618) kid is something that is subject to  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1619) disassembly yeah  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1621) or  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1622) uh  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1623) take out yeah yeah beautiful okay that's  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1625) it so after you've identified it  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1628) yeah then that's it it's done  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1630) then the then the atheist interlocus  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1632) announced to come and say why the  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1633) universe  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1635) despite being susceptible to injection  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1637) or let's just call it uh additional  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1639) subtraction yeah  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1640) despite having this thing or being made  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1643) composed of different parts which are  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1645) susceptible such thing  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1647) why is it  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1648) that it can still be seen as  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1652) necessary you see the point yeah  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1657) okay  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1658) any questions so far because i know  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1659) we're kind of moving quick quickly  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1661) uh you said that this this  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1664) is anything which is susceptible to the  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1666) composition on an empirical level right  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1668) yeah so if an atheist is disabled they  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1670) take the universe for instance we don't  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1672) have any empirical evidence that you can  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1675) subtract from the universe or take  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1676) something out of the universe  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1679) yeah i mean we don't need to show that  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1682) is saying that if it's conceivable  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1685) that and he does say if it's conceivable  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1687) he said even even if you don't see it  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1691) he may mention that  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1693) yeah he says even if it's conceivable  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1695) that this thing which is an object you  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1696) can take something out of it and put  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1698) into it even if you have witnessed such  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1700) a thing  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1701) then the thing is uh composed  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1704) but that's what matami is saying i'm  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1706) saying that ibn cena or the original  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1707) argument says anything that is made up  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1709) of our parts  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1711) we've refined what we mean by parts now  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1713) yeah anything which is made out of parts  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1715) is contingent the universe is made out  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1716) of parts we don't need to prove that the  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1719) universe you can take things out and put  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1720) things in  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1722) all we need to show is that the universe  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1723) is made out of parts which is  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1725) indupitable no one can it's  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1726) incontrovertible  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1728) no one can say well the universe is not  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1729) made out of parts if you say well the  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1731) the multiverse is not made out of parts  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1733) well what differentiate how could it be  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1734) a multiverse you're using the word multi  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1736) anyway how could it be a multiverse if  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1738) it's not more than one universe  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1740) so each v each universe is a part of the  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1743) multiverse  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1744) and it's not just any part it's a part  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1746) that could otherwise not be in there  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1747) even if we didn't witness that  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1749) so to entertain me this would not be  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1751) this would not be an issue  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1754) yes oh was one of the main reasons why  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1756) even singing i was making this argument  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1757) is because he believed in universes  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1761) um because if he didn't would you have  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1763) for something like that the thing is to  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1765) be honest we'll come to we'll actually  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1766) come to the idea of even tamiyas and i  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1768) do believe it's problematic and i have  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1770) to be honest with you like you don't  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1771) have to agree or disagree with me here  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1772) but  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1774) his his objections on this whole  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1776) universal thing  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1777) and we have to ask ourselves to what  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1779) extent  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1780) can he remain consistent with this  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1783) this is the question how to what extent  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1785) can it be i remain consistent with this  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1788) we'll see what i mean by that but  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1790) the this idea of uh denying of the  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1792) universals is not something you find  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1793) from the salaf  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1794) i mean you will not find a lalaka and  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1796) bhatta in his kitab saying and we deny  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1798) the universals like you will not find  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1800) this or at the hau is creed saying yes  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1802) and we deny the coulee  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1804) it's impossible to find such a thing  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1806) it's not there it just doesn't exist and  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1808) so we have like i said before if someone  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1810) takes a different opinion  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1812) to even tell me on his theo  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1813) philosophical renderings it doesn't mean  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1815) anything it just means that you disagree  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1817) with him philosophically on an issue  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1819) which that has not actually spoken about  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1820) explicitly and that is the reality of  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1822) the situation and that's why i was  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1823) saying last week that ibn tamiya does  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1826) not represent  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1828) all of his positions are not not they  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1830) are not an imitation of what the self  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1832) said he has expanded i'm not saying he's  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1834) going against them but he says things  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1836) that they never said  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1838) that's that is a fact and no one can  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1840) deny that fact only somebody who is  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1843) uh  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1844) maybe a liar or  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1848) you know or something like this yeah  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1851) okay so we we've covered the following  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1853) we talked about the humbly development  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1855) okay of the  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1857) of creed and stuff like that what kind  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1859) of developments there are and then we  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1860) talked about even tamiya and his  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1861) importance and we talked about the issue  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1863) of turkey and we talked about even  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1865) tamiya's prime objection which is one to  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1867) do with with the with the attributes of  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1869) god  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1871) and now  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1872) we will talk  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1874) about ibn and we talked about  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1875) entertainment solution  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1877) and then there was this discussions  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1878) about his general epistemology  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1881) so  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1883) let me read something okay to explain to  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1886) you his general epistemology okay from  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1887) his works which i've translated myself  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1890) and this is uh  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1892) in  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1893) this once again yeah and you'll find  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1895) that a lot of these things are intimated  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1898) in swahili  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1900) is and it's a very short book which  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1902) we're translating by the way you know  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1904) the sapiens institute is uh translating  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1907) that book and another book of mutation  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1908) because as we said this is quite  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1910) important yeah  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1913) he says and it is known that the  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1915) composing in this regard and by  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1918) this regard he means something being  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1920) susceptible to disassembly yeah  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1922) it's dependent on something other than  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1924) itself  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1925) that is  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1926) if its essence entails composition such  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1929) that separation would not be possible  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1930) for it  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1931) and the necessary existence can er  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1933) necessary existence cannot be dependent  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1935) on anything external to itself  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1937) as would be contradiction and that would  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1939) be contradictory  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1940) there is no doubt that those who affirm  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1942) the attributes of god or any other  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1944) muslim group  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1945) reject this type of composition relation  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1946) to god  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1949) is saying this kind of composition in  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1951) relation to god  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1952) every muslim group reject it  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1955) this is ibrahimi is saying this just  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1956) just in case because some say well you  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1958) are going  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1961) this this is telling actually because  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1962) even tamiya is actually  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1964) referencing other groups even though  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1965) he's polemical towards them but he's  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1967) showing look all of us agree here  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1970) the ashadis agree their maturities agree  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1972) everyone agrees we all agree  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1974) that this kind of composition is not um  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1976) allowed  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1977) despite this fact the pseudo  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1978) philosophers and by that he means the  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1980) actual philosophers but he's he's  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1982) humiliating them you know and sometimes  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1984) he does and he doesn't give he doesn't  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1986) give him credit i mean it's not like he  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1988) doesn't give them credit he does he does  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1989) accept you know that they are right on  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1991) some issues but he never praises them i  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1993) don't think i've ever seen anything  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1994) praising even cena of those guys he  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1996) praises razali all the time  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1998) and like we said last week you know he  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=1999) will say about him  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2001) islam or he will refer to a father and  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2004) all these kinds of terms he he praises  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2006) his but he has his limits  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2009) eventually has the limits here  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2011) refer to the attributes of god as a kind  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2012) of composition whereby they claim that  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2015) the human is composed of genus and a  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2016) specific difference and we talked about  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2018) that the rational human they're saying  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2020) look at this the construction rational  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2021) human that's what he's talking about  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2022) here he says  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2024) through the use of terms like animality  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2026) and capacity to reason they assign the  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2028) meanings of atoms and accidents to the  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2029) human constitution  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2031) if they deduce from this definition that  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2033) the human being is composed of atoms  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2035) then there is nothing in the description  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2037) of rational animal which warrants this  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2039) meaning or indicates the accidentality  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2041) of these values  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2042) the meaning embedded in the definition  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2044) of rational animal are confined to the  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2045) mental process once again it's a  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2047) conceptualist at the critique here  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2050) such that one imagines rationalization a  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2052) pure form and an animal and in a pure  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2054) form and obviously puts them together  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2055) right however the mere fact that this  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2057) can be done in the mind does not mean  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2059) that the external realm that these three  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2061) types of substance exist can be found  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2065) and  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2065) knowledge of this is foundational  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2069) and this is basically an anti-idealist  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2071) stance clearly like you know is almost  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2074) what you would see from a materialist to  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2075) an idealist in substance theory  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2078) um so here he's saying  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2080) he's saying look his general  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2082) epistemology  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2084) he's saying if something cannot and he  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2085) says this explicitly and i should bring  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2087) this up  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2088) he mentions if something cannot it's not  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2090) susceptible to arad or johar  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2093) and he mentions that again in the  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2096) swahili if something is not  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2098) cannot  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2099) now we've said is something which is  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2101) accident like a color  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2103) and johar  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2104) is something which is indivisible  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2107) a johar fart is an invisible atom  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2109) indivisible atom  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2111) so johar  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2113) is something which something in here is  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2114) in  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2115) so something which is like the  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2117) broken down it's a physical thing  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2119) so he it would tell me they're saying if  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2120) something is not an accident such that  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2122) in here's in atoms  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2124) or the simples call them symbols call  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2126) them whatever you like yeah things that  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2128) are broken down into little pieces of  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2130) remember is the indivisible atom  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2132) so if something does not break down into  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2133) those two different types then it  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2135) doesn't really exist  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2137) well the question is if  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2139) can we subject allah subhanallah to such  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2141) a test  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2142) this will be the response you're saying  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2144) that something is there's a johar test  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2146) johar no he's asking the question he  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2148) would tell me  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2150) is this thing that you're talking about  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2152) is it johar say no it's not  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2155) is it  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2156) is it an accident no it's not an  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2157) accident so what is it  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2158) so we say okay no problem we agree  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2161) but the question is can you can you  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2164) subject allah and his attributes to this  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2166) test  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2167) how do you think he responds i'll tell  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2169) you how i respond because i was trying  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2170) to find the response and i looked you  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2172) know left and right and asked some  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2174) people of knowledge and this and that  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2176) and i found the response  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2178) and this actually in  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2181) actually in  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2182) the month  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2183) he mentions this and  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2185) actually translates this book it's  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2186) called the response to the greek  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2188) logicians  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2189) and by the way the word greek is not  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2190) their own original title maybe that's  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2192) how some of these brothers from the  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2193) salafis  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2194) agra they think that's everything is all  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2196) the logic is greek no it's not some  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2198) logic is not greek you know somebody's  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2199) greek some is not anyways it's a  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2201) separate topic  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2202) uh  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2204) he states  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2205) he eventually has this conception of  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2208) al barteny  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2211) okay  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2213) so  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2213) well halaq  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2216) you'll be surprised because you know  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2217) he's written political issues and stuff  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2219) like that the impossible state and all  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2220) that he's christian he's not muslim by  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2222) the way yeah  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2223) but he um i don't even know if he's  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2224) christian he's definitely muslim  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2227) well halaq  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2229) he he considers him he refers to him as  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2231) an empiricist and i think this is too  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2233) strong because how can you be a muslim  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2234) empiricist like what do you mean by  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2236) empiricist  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2237) really the the most you can say is that  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2239) he's he is anti-idealist yani but he's  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2242) not an empiricist in that sense  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2244) but  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2248) mentions  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2249) i can actually read what he says because  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2251) i think it's somewhat important yeah he  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2252) says imitate me i held that universals  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2254) can never exist in the extra mental  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2257) world  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2258) but only in the mind in in the  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2260) experimental world only individuated  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2262) particulars exist  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2264) particulars that are specific distinct  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2266) and unique  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2267) in fact  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2268) in in fact external individuals are so  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2270) unique in matamia argues that they  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2273) cannot allow for a formation of external  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2276) universal  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2278) uh i think i've read that wrong which  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2280) are subsumed  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2282) but these individuals  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2284) but these individuals there can be only  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2287) an aspect or aspects of similarity but  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2289) they cannot be entirely identical from  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2291) this have been tamiya concludes that the  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2292) universality of the genus the species  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2294) species and difference cannot be  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2297) uh the essence  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2299) for the unit he's saying that an essence  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2301) has to be because that has to be  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2304) you know it has to subsist in and of  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2306) itself  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2307) but he's saying if it's  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2308) if if it's in the mind then it's not  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2310) quite  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2311) it's in the mind this is  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2313) so for the universal nothing is more  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2315) than a common general meaning and that  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2316) the mind retains to signify individuals  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2319) in the real world  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2324) now  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2326) it will tell me you're saying there are  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2328) some things  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2330) that are just in hustle botany like for  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2332) example your emotions anger  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2334) your love  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2335) pleasure pain all of that stuff  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2338) it's  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2339) a first person subjective experience  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2341) yeah and he's saying yeah we accept that  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2343) and then he he'll relegate the fitrah to  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2346) this  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2346) so the way to  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2348) to because you know he said  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2349) test yeah  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2351) he got the arnold  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2354) is this thing whatever it is that you  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2355) it's universal that you're speaking  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2356) about is  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2358) it an accident  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2359) no it's not  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2360) an accident is it a johar is it made up  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2363) of atoms or something  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2365) yes or let's call it a substrate or  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2369) substance let's just call it substance  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2372) is it a substance no is it an accident  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2375) no so it doesn't exist okay  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2378) what would make you say of anger  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2380) jealousy whatever all these emotions he  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2381) said that's in the hessian botany  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2383) so he's got something in his personality  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2385) for that which is  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2386) the the internal emotions and the fitra  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2388) is there and therefore knowledge of  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2390) allah can be detected from the fitra and  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2392) that's how you understand allah  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2394) but then the question will be then  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2398) well just as much as you can you can  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2400) feel the  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2402) jealousy and the anger and all these  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2403) kind of things  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2405) these are universal categories in a  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2407) sense  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2408) can you not is it is it incredulous for  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2410) someone to say that well  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2412) um you can feel uh  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2415) universals  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2418) how can you deny that  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2420) well you can deny that in as much the  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2421) same way as someone can deny your  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2424) from a demonstrative perspective  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2426) like if we're talking third person  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2427) demonstration  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2429) and that's what  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2430) attacks him on actually he makes a whole  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2432) thing to attack anyone this  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2433) uh so  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2435) if you're saying well um  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2437) my father is i believe in god i believe  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2439) i was what i feel have got well someone  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2441) could say i believe in whatever put put  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2443) in the blanks universal and then that's  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2444) it  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2446) so  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2446) it seems to me that that there's an  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2448) issue here which if there are is a price  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2451) to pay there is an epistemological  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2454) price to pay for  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2456) for taking the conceptualist position  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2457) yeah yeah what are the um  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2460) accepting universes like why was he  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2462) running away from that  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2464) i can't speculate but if i had to have a  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2466) guess  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2468) i think he's just trying to like that  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2470) like this might sound quite crude crash  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2472) yeah  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2473) but  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2474) if you're asking me it's an opinion now  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2476) pure opinion no problem yeah  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2478) i personally believe it been telling me  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2479) i was trying to cut all the roots  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2481) to a negative outcome like for example  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2483) you know this whole thing where he  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2484) believes there's no metaphor in the  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2485) quran  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2487) which not but basically even had ability  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2489) except that yeah except for his  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2490) disciples  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2492) and so on but other yani it's not it's  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2494) not a really popular opinion among the  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2496) grammarians for example like there's no  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2500) why do you think he's doing that i think  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2502) the reason why he's doing that so people  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2503) say well if there's no method from the  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2504) quran how can you metaphorize the names  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2506) and attributes of god if there's nobody  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2508) you see  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2509) and likewise for my this is i think it's  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2511) just it's just a trend of  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2513) how he deals with things he rips things  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2515) from the roots he uproots things  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2518) he that he doesn't he doesn't like just  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2519) demolishing something  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2521) if you don't like cutting down trees he  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2522) likes going in and taking the roux out  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2524) and  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2524) you know destroying everything  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2527) and so in this sense i think he's done  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2528) the same thing i think he's he's  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2530) uh said you know these people are  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2533) basically this philosopher this martessa  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2535) are using tarkib and they are using  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2538) specific specification or  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2540) particularization they're using these  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2541) things so that they can come to a  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2543) conclusion of nephew's effect from a  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2544) logical perspective so what i'm going to  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2546) do is i'm going to annihilate any  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2548) conception  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2549) of uh of turkey  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2552) just like i annihilated the  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2554) metaphorization of the quran and  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2555) executive perspective it's the same kind  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2556) of  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2557) this general thought process you can  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2560) kind of see the temperament within  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2561) tamiya here you can see what kind of a  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2563) man he is quite frankly he he's a bit  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2565) it's like a lion you know he doesn't  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2567) like to just  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2569) take the prey and destroy it he likes to  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2571) make sure that  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2572) or maybe i shouldn't go into further  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2574) details but  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2576) but he makes sure that everything is  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2577) eliminated you know  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2579) yeah but uh  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2581) i think that's the reason why  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2583) if you ask me that's my opinion of why  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2585) he's done that but  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2586) why do you need to say why do you need  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2588) to really take a anti-neuroplatonic  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2590) position like that much is it because  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2591) the quran sunnah makes it so clear  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2594) is it not i don't think so it's simply  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2595) because  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2596) like i say he wants to really take the  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2599) sword to the jugular  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2600) of the opponent and  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2602) i think that's what he's done but as  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2604) we'll see  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2605) there are complications with this and  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2607) i'll tell you where the complications  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2608) are and i'll i'll be as charitable as  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2609) possible today but he's a thinker just  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2611) like anything and as um  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2614) alex says  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2617) you know alex said every human being on  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2619) the face of the earth you take something  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2620) from him and you reject something from  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2622) him except for muhammad  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2624) so yani i know this is this figure which  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2627) is imminent we respect very dearly and  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2629) spending time and effort and you know to  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2631) understand what he's saying  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2632) is c is is like holy figure in you know  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2636) that's what he is salafi circles he's  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2637) the untouchable one really he's under  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2640) everybody from the selfies accepts this  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2642) man i don't know of any selfie that does  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2643) not  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2644) that which is major which is major and  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2646) he's respected even among other groups  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2648) which is why we're talking about him  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2650) here  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2650) but we have to also see where he could  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2652) have gone wrong  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2653) and i know that's very uncomfortable for  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2655) some people and people are refusing oh  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2656) is it trying no i'm not just it's just  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2658) what it's not  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2658) we have to  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2660) so we're gonna look at that yeah  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2663) through the different ways that he goes  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2665) through he's mentioned five ways that  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2667) you can understand composition  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2669) and then he basically  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2670) deletes a lot of the other definitions  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2672) and says okay this is the one that we're  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2674) talking about disassembly whatever  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2676) what i understood from you is that he  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2678) gets rid of the other ones  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2680) largely based on his  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2682) backup histological positions yeah the  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2684) fact that he's denies the universe and  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2686) stuff yes  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2687) he denies them in  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2688) the extra mental world right right so if  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2690) we if we decide to say that okay we're  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2692) gonna take whatever tami is saying in  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2694) religion like we're gonna take his  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2695) definition of parts  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2697) but we don't take for instance his  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2699) epistemology yeah then isn't  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2701) does that make our rejection of the  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2703) other definitions a bit arbitrary now  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2706) we don't have to say in that way is that  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2708) we're going to do this it was like it's  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2710) a big buffet and we're taking some of  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2711) this and take some of that  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2713) we're saying it's not like we have to  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2715) affirm anything either i'm not saying go  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2717) ahead let's affirm the universals it  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2718) been say me as making a stronger case  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2720) than just uh than just being agnostic  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2722) about the universals or having a neutral  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2724) position  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2725) like  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2726) he is saying that they are not they  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2727) don't exist in the role they don't exist  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2728) in extreme reality yeah what i'm saying  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2731) is that going that far and saying  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2732) something does not exist  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2734) like putting an atheistic posit like you  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2736) know atheists have negative atheists and  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2738) positive atheists positivity say god  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2740) doesn't exist  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2741) that most atheists are negative atheists  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2744) so they'll say that we don't know if god  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2745) exists or not i'm saying there's no need  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2747) to take a very strong position on  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2748) universals i'm i'm not saying that he's  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2751) wrong about it universals might very  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2753) well not might not exist  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2755) but it's not  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2756) for me i don't see why it's impossible  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2758) that allah created them  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2760) yeah and it's for me it's not an  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2761) impossible creation it's not like a  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2763) squared circle  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2764) that allah creates some universal  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2766) somewhere  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2767) i just  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2768) explained like  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2770) this idea of adam ash head and the new  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2772) platonic forms and stuff like that  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2775) you know i'm not saying we should adopt  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2777) a new platonic forms either that you  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2778) know there's this perfect  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2780) idea of what a sword looks like and the  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2781) differentiation what differentiates us a  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2783) knife from a sword  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2786) so what length does it actually have to  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2787) be  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2788) so if you get a knife what length does  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2790) it actually have to be  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2791) when it stops being a knife and starts  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2793) being a sword  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2796) when is it is it 10 inches 15 inches 13  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2800) inches when exactly so so plato would  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2803) maybe argue that there's a there's a  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2805) perfect length where if it gets that  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2806) length now it's a sword  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2808) because this uh this archetype or this  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2811) is of the sword is there in the  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2813) animation somewhere  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2816) i'm saying that it's it's not completely  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2817) irrational really  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2819) but let me tell you where it gets  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2820) problematic so obviously  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2822) we we went through something in this uh  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2825) in these sessions where we were speaking  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2827) about and we're moving on now to tell  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2829) hate arguments so oh and the goal rap  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2832) we'll you know do the goal rap maybe  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2834) more detail  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2837) but the idea that you know evan cena who  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2838) remembers how he been cena argues for  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2841) the oneness of god  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2842) my do you remember that  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2844) oh i see you don't pay attention  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2847) how does even cena argue for the for the  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2849) oneness of god do you remember  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2851) yeah and  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2853) so his argument was uh  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2856) a necessary existence um  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2859) can only be one because um  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2861) uh if there was more than one necessary  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2863) existence uh by definition they would be  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2865) dependent on uh uh on the other  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2868) existence  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2869) so uh the uh  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2871) so that would make it a contingent  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2872) existence not a necessary existence  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2875) yes  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2875) so they've been telling me his  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2877) argument against that is  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2879) because i looked at  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2880) shanghai  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2882) and then i couldn't really fight like he  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2884) attacked it but he didn't go into detail  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2886) about this attack and i kept looking  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2887) over what he was trying to say and i  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2888) couldn't really understood what he was  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2890) saying but it wasn't fleshed out nicely  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2892) but then when we found that book  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2894) recently  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2895) philosopher which is a new manuscript  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2897) and whatever  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2898) when he found that i saw his response  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2900) there i think i understood what he was  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2902) saying now because it made me understand  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2904) it so basically this is what he's that's  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2906) what he's saying  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2908) he's saying he goes back to the  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2910) universal thing he's saying look  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2913) when you're saying there's one necessary  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2914) existence another necessary existence  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2915) and either if you're talking about the  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2916) same things either tautological or that  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2919) one of them is contingent or that both  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2920) of them are contingent or that is  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2921) created or that a third party created  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2923) the two things which means that that's  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2924) necessary and both those are contingent  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2926) these are the exhaustive things that i  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2928) mentioned in his book here  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2929) he's saying that  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2931) but this is all conceptual analysis  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2935) this is all conceptual analysis it's all  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2937) concepts you're just dealing with  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2938) concepts and so the necessary existence  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2940) that you're talking about here  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2942) is propositional and this is exactly  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2944) what emanuel kant said  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2946) emmanuel kant he famously said  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2949) existence is not a proposition  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2953) he i believe emmanuel kant saw his works  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2956) this guy uh it became his works i  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2957) believe so because a critique of pure  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2959) reason think think of the titles as well  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2961) critique of pure reason and  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2964) a response to the logicians  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2966) do you see  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2968) and evan you can't slide his book  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2969) bismuth  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2971) some manuscripts yeah i mean i i do  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2973) imagine is the biggest is by far this  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2976) one you know in german in german uh  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2978) philosophy is number one basically  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2980) in terms of philosophy  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2982) you know  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2984) uh  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2987) but  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2989) it's it's exactly what he said here  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2992) and if you i don't want to go into a  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2993) tangent but  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2996) in tamiya has an attack on the syllogism  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=2998) have you come across this  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3001) the the response to the greek logicians  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3003) it been samia attacks uh  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3006) uh all men are mortal socrates are man  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3008) therefore socrates is more immortal yeah  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3010) that's syllogism and when samia said  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3012) well  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3013) to be honest with you  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3015) all you're doing is  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3016) all the information that is mentioned in  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3018) the first premise is mentioned  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3020) the conclusion  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3021) includes information as mentioned in the  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3022) first premise  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3024) so in other words it's  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3025) all syllogism are total logical  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3028) and by the way mathematics is sort of  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3029) logical as well  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3031) and he's right i mean if i say 2 plus 2  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3033) equals 4 what am i saying  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3035) 4 equals 4.  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3037) yanni 2 plus 2 is just another  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3038) expression of four but i'm just saying  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3040) two plus two  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3041) but two plus two is just another way of  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3043) saying four so it's like saying  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3045) it's like saying four expressing it in a  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3047) different way all of mathematics is like  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3048) that in many ways the syllogism is like  
[0:50:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3051) that as well  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3052) because if you say oh man immortal that  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3053) includes obviously a woman immortal then  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3055) socrates is a mortal what you're doing  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3057) is you're you're extracting  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3059) uh uh obvious common sense notion  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3062) from the  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3063) the the conclusion from the from the  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3066) premise so he's saying he doesn't give  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3067) you new knowledge here that's what he  
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3069) was saying and it's a very powerful  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3070) people think oh that therefore because  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3072) he wrote a book called  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3073) the response  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3075) sorry musicians that he's against logic  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3077) yeah she's foolish people he's going  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3079) deeper than he's saying logic has  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3081) problems for example one of his um  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3084) one of his uh one of his uh attacks was  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3087) on al had  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3088) with the definition the logical  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3089) definition  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3091) because he says that kind of  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3093) and he said it's not possible  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3095) and in fact he mentions that general  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3096) management is comprehensive can you have  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3098) a definition which completely  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3100) uh covers all of the things of that  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3102) particular subject matter he says no it  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3103) doesn't doesn't exist and you don't need  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3105) it and it's superfluous part of the  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3107) discourse  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3108) for example what is the definition of  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3110) love  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3110) remember he mentions love  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3112) it is very powerful what is it what is  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3114) the definition of love i mean that's my  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3115) question to you can you tell me  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3119) i mean there's a song that was i want to  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3121) know what love is i want you to show me  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3124) and that's what i've been telling you i  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3125) was saying is in saying that you can you  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3127) can you cannot put love into a  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3128) definitional format i want to know what  
[0:52:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3130) love is you don't write it down like you  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3132) know i have my own definition of love by  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3134) the way  
[0:52:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3135) but it's which is that it's attachment  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3138) that if threatened causes anxiety and if  
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3140) removed causes grief  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3143) this is  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3144) but then my my problem is is that i was  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3146) thinking about this how do i  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3147) differentiate i'll give you this as an  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3149) example right  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3150) it's a bit slightly relevant you know  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3152) but how how that definition sorry to say  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3155) does not differentiate between platonic  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3157) forms of love i'm critiquing my own  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3158) definition here but it doesn't  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3160) differentiate between platonic forms of  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3162) love and romantic forms of love  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3164) like how would you give me a definition  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3167) that you can use in in articulated  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3169) format which  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3171) differentiates clearly between romantic  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3173) forms of love and platonic forms of love  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3175) i don't think you can do it  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3177) all i come to myself when i thought  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3178) about it is that well it just tastes  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3180) different like or it feels different  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3183) whatever you like  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3185) oh so it's sexual  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3187) no but no but sex is a different  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3189) category now under the desire maybe  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3191) now let's let's imagine that there's a  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3193) platonic there's a romantic relationship  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3194) between people that have you know have  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3197) no sexual vigor  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3198) but it's still a romantic relationship  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3200) like elderly people or something like  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3201) that it's still a romantic relationship  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3203) you know  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3204) how do we differentiate such a  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3205) relationship  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3206) between the platonic in terms of  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3208) definitional format  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3210) he's saying it was saying you won't be  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3212) able to basically this is what he's  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3213) saying he's literally this example again  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3216) love and all that kind he cannot use  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3217) he's saying you cannot  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3220) try your best and do this and do that  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3221) yuka yani  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3223) basically he says that the ones who know  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3225) about these things are the practitioners  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3227) of it  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3228) lovers like me romantics  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3231) but you know that's uh that's that's the  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3233) point you see but anyway the reason why  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3235) i'm making putting this to your  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3236) attention is because he was meticulous  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3238) in his his argumentative method he  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3240) wasn't  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3240) he wasn't slap dash or going in  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3242) haphazardly and stuff like that no no  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3244) he was  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3246) he thought  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3247) very deeply about these matters as you  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3249) can see  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3250) i mean really and truly one of the  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3252) greatest contributions to the western  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3253) philosophical canon made similar  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3255) arguments as we're seeing here  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3258) which is immanuel kant if you look at  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3260) manuel kant's attack on the cosmological  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3262) argument and his attack on the  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3263) ontological argument  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3265) his attack on the ontological argument  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3267) is very similar to the attack of tamiya  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3268) on  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3270) the universals  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3273) and they're not elaborative at all  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3275) like  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3277) kants in  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3277) not elaborative but they're just there  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3280) which shows you that great minds think  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3282) alike or that maybe great minds copy  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3283) other great minds  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3285) one of one of one or one or the other  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3288) but um so he's rejecting this he's  
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3290) saying that you know this idea of you  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3292) know if you talk about necessary  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3293) existence in this conceptual format  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3294) there's an issue here  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3296) but the way he's um  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3298) what he does is he does what he believes  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3301) in  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3303) is  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3315) and nor does he have any creator with  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3317) him and had he had any creators with him  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3320) they would have each snatched away some  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3321) part of their create uh creation and so  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3323) he says this even samia says if the  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3325) world has two manufacturers it would be  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3327) the case that if one of them willed  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3328) something and the other will the  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3329) opposite for example  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3331) if one of them willed for the sun to  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3333) rise from the east and the other one  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3334) will for the sun to rise in the west it  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3335) would have been impossible for either of  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3337) the two manufacturers to realize his  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3340) respective will  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3342) as would entail  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3344) bring together two opposite things  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3346) okay  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3347) either one of them will realize his will  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3349) such that the others cannot be  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3351) considered supreme lord or the opposite  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3352) and this is a very strong and probably  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3353) the most powerful argument  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3355) yeah  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3356) you can't have two supreme wills as  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3358) simple as that  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3359) and when i try and explain this to  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3361) children  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3363) i use like uh maybe i shouldn't but i  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3365) use this kind of example you see example  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3368) like  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3369) imagine if this is a yani if god  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3372) sorry to say any  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3374) it cannot be imagined that he will lose  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3376) a fight  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3376) or it cannot be imagined he will draw a  
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3378) fight okay i'll fight true and if he had  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3380) to compromise then that would entail his  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3383) insufficiency  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3385) and so this basically so he's saying  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3387) this is fine but then the question is  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3389) doesn't this argument itself become  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3391) conceptual  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3394) yeah and if you're talking about supreme  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3395) will it's not something you've seen is  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3397) it  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3398) have you seen this i mean have you seen  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3400) i mean the supreme will of god you've  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3402) not seen that  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3404) the supreme creative capacity of god  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3405) you've not seen that  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3407) the only thing i can say  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3411) now  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3411) in order to save evantaemia from this  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3414) trouble  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3416) is as follows and uh and i have thought  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3418) about this quite  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3419) a lot yeah  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3421) it's to say that even tamiya and he  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3422) makes this clear in shanghai  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3425) he says that we must have cosmological i  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3427) mean not we must have but he prefers  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3429) cosmological starting points to the  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3431) arguments for existence of god and then  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3433) argues  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3434) on infinite rigorous basis which is  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3436) against what al-halak says because said  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3438) that he doesn't even make an argument of  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3439) god's existence which is false he does  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3440) make an argument because clearly he does  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3443) it will tell me it makes argument for  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3444) god's existence in shanghai  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3446) he says the best arguments from hadooth  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3449) and he does the same thing in  
[0:57:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3451) and he rejects uh the he rejects the  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3454) hadith sam argument of the martesilla  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3457) and that also the ashara's use which is  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3459) atomism the idea of atomism and so on  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3461) and he doesn't reject them can argument  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3462) even cena he accepts it but he says just  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3464) long and unnecessary  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3466) that's what he's saying he said it's  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3468) correct but it's not it's long it's a  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3469) bit long and he has all this problem  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3471) with taqib  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3472) but he actually rejects the johar  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3474) argument the uh  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3476) argument of the mata he actually rejects  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3477) it and this is mentioned clearly in his  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3479) books  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3480) uh but um  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3481) what i was saying about that is that  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3483) the only thing i can say is that whereas  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3486) we didn't see this argument he assigned  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3487) directly with the conceptual analysis  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3489) he's saying look imagine if you have one  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3490) necessary existence and he says and  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3492) that's something that cannot  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3494) be imagined any other way a contingent  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3496) thing is that if it's removed no  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3498) contradiction would occur so if  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3500) something which is necessary which  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3501) cannot be existed any other way if it's  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3503) removed and the possibility will occur  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3506) from uh in the creation  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3507) and so he's saying forget about all of  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3509) that it would take me to say start with  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3511) cosmological slang points we see the  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3513) rain coming down from the sky we see the  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3514) plants coming out from the ground we see  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3516) the trees coming all this kind of things  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3518) all of this at the beginning right yeah  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3519) we say we have the beginning no problem  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3520) so they can't have an infinite regress  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3522) and you know the argument  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3524) and he argues that there cannot be an  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3526) infinite regress of causes but he does  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3528) believe in  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3529) clearly yeah which is that god is  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3531) perpetually creating into the past and  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3532) he believes in actual infinity therefore  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3534) that he has tells him that entails that  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3536) he believes in accident so which goes  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3537) against our shady proof which we'll talk  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3539) about next week  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3540) uh the view that there cannot be an  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3542) actual infinity it doesn't it cannot  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3543) exist mathematically and there isn't as  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3546) a controversy in maths not just in  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3548) philosophy in maths whether or not an  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3550) actual infiniti can  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3551) happen or not even in the future  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3554) not in  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3555) in in any in any form there's a  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3557) controversy as if this can this thing  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3559) exist or not and you might have  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3561) hilbert's famous uh hotel have you heard  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3563) of this william lane craig and all these  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3565) kind of things talk about it  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3568) and if you look at william lane craig's  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3569) kind of argumentative method he's using  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3571) arguments okay but it's not just ashari  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3573) arguments it's obviously arguments of  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3574) jonathan lopez and you know these  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3576) individuals before but really he uses  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3577) the ghazalian version yeah which is an  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3579) ashari version so  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3581) it's interesting that you know he's  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3582) using the quran to defend the bible or  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3584) he's using the muslims to defend his uh  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3586) faith  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3587) that's something else for another day  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3588) but that's um  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3590) the idea of infinite or infinity  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3593) one of the proofs for the existence of  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3595) god that are used by the ashadis  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3598) especially  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3599) is that they cannot be an infinity in  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3600) the real world and then he he says  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3602) therefore you know  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3603) uh there must be uh first cause whatever  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3606) you've heard this argument before i'm  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3607) sure you've heard it before yeah  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3609) cosmological argument the first the  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3610) first first way of thomas aquinas  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3612) whatever yeah let me tell you this i  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3614) don't care about all of that and there  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3615) can be infinite in the real world which  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3617) is very powerful  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3619) he said i don't care about that and in  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3621) fact he refused  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3624) who came before him  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3626) and didn't have a chance to respond  
[1:00:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3627) therefore but but he refutes him  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3630) no he refutes him and says you know why  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3631) cannot he says do you not believe in  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3633) fact he makes an interesting point he  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3635) said do you not believe in heaven hell  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3637) and it's going to be infinite time and  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3638) infinite this and infinite coming so why  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3639) did you make an exception for post  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3640) post-eternity and you know he makes  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3642) logical points annie  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3644) and  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3645) uh if you speak to an atheist who is you  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3648) know hell-bent on the opinion that  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3649) anthony can exist in the real world and  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3651) they can be an infinite multiverse  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3654) then you you insisting that they can't  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3655) be the case  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3656) you're gonna have to bring out all of  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3658) the tools of the mathematical warehouse  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3659) and you're gonna have to show them this  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3660) now ibm tamiya's way actually helps us  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3662) here because he's saying look even  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3664) though  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3665) there can be an infinite regress of  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3666) things originated things that god  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3669) perpetually creates instead of past  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3670) there cannot be an infinite regress of  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3672) causes  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3674) and he gives exactly pretty much the  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3675) same proof of the philosopher  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3677) because he says i don't know of anyone  
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3678) who disagrees with that and he's right  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3679) there's not many people who disagree  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3680) with the point that they cannot be an  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3682) infinite regress of causes originated  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3683) things  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3684) unless i've you know i've missed  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3686) something on the quantum discussions  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3688) certainly not in the medieval world  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3690) that that was the case any questions  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3691) here  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3693) in relation to the supreme world uh  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3695) can't even take me and say that but it's  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3698) not i'm just  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3699) in relation to the supreme world yeah  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3702) he says look it's in the quran  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3704) that allah has that and  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3705) foreign i believe in the quran as being  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3707) legitimate no no he doesn't say this  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3709) in fact quite frankly um he ibrahim  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3714) refutes al-ahmadi  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3716) that's exactly what he says  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3720) he says that the tamannaah argument  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3724) he doesn't accept it  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3725) he says i i accept it only because  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3727) it's in the quran i accept it because  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3729) allah has revealed it ibm tell me he  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3731) says not actually and he refutes him on  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3733) that even tell me he refutes him on the  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3734) grounds that actually no this is you  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3737) cannot just say it's in the quran and  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3738) that's like  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3745) actually the boldness to say even though  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3747) it's in the quran  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3748) as an argument can you imagine this he  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3750) says even though i don't accept the  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3752) argumentative structure of this  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3755) is saying that you know he's saying that  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3757) i believe in diverse  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3759) as  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3760) i wouldn't use it as an argument  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3765) or because the argument from what i  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3767) remember what he was saying is that  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3768) basically you cannot do durable method  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3770) with mustahil or something like that  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3773) i think that's what it is  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3775) you know  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3777) so he's saying the arguments in the  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3779) quran  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3780) i accept it as the quran but it's  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3782) argument i don't really feel it yeah  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3784) basically yeah  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3786) subhanallah  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3787) yes yes i think  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3789) maybe maybe you can take from that and  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3790) i'm no expert in them but they'll read  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3792) it again but and maybe can someone  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3794) correct me from someone who's very  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3795) lamely quite well but  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3797) you can take from that that al-ahmad is  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3798) saying that basically that you know  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3800) uh  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3801) what policy isn't  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3803) is logically impossible i don't know if  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3805) that's what he would say  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3807) that the reason why he doesn't believe  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3808) in a quran maybe i don't know if that's  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3811) what he could that was but it was a  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3813) clear  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3816) there's a clear like you know locking of  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3818) the horns here like you know even tell  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3819) me i refute him quite heavily for this  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3823) and emily is one of those figures now  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3824) that there's phd's being done on him  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3825) actually  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3826) in the western world as i think it's a  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3827) woman i come about her name but she's  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3828) doing a phd she talks lectures on emily  
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3830) and those kind of things but the reason  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3832) why you always find and this might sound  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3834) very uh  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3836) over rapid generalizations and stuff  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3838) but uh you always find western academics  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3841) flocking to those individuals who say  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3843) the wildest things  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3846) you know even has them and remedy you  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3848) know  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3849) yeah we've been cena you know it's  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3851) academics they love this kind of because  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3852) they oh they're thinking outside the box  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3853) you know they don't want to go status  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3855) quo  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3855) so you'll find them you know  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3857) flocking to these ones and praising them  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3859) and all that even are huge  
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3862) they love him you know  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3864) so  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3866) you know  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3867) anyway  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3870) there was i saying it is just that but  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3873) he was he was traditional like ahmed he  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3874) was his ashari like he was stuck he  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3876) stuck with the  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3878) ashari line it's not like he just he  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3879) just made some he thought outside the  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3881) box quite a lot  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3884) um what was i saying now so yeah it is  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3887) conceptual at the point where you're  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3888) talking about the all powerful agency of  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3891) allah  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3893) but you you you're how you're you're  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3895) thinking about that now it's conceptual  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3898) the only thing you can say is that ibm  
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3899) tamiya starts with cosmological starting  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3901) points but then the question is on what  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3903) grounds is it legitimate that you can  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3905) conceptualize things and make arguments  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3907) conceptually on something if and only if  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3911) yeah they start with cosmological  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3912) starting points  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3914) does that make sense so what the  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3916) question would be then why is it that if  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3918) you start of cosmological starting  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3919) points  
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3921) um subsequent conceptualization  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3923) legitimate whereas if you don't it's not  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3928) this is a question  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3929) and that's something he has not  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3930) addressed  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3932) the futura is not uh remember for him  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3934) first is instinct it's not knowledge  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3936) like that so it's not you cannot say  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3938) well  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3940) it's not it's not a strong argument  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3943) so i think this is this is an issue here  
[1:05:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3945) like you know  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3946) but you don't need to once again it's  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3948) like you're disabling your own army  
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3950) like in a sense you don't need to make  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3952) because i can see if you take a strong  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3954) nominalist or conceptus position how  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3956) that can bite you back like this would  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3958) be something an atheist could say  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3960) well if you're saying universals don't  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3961) exist  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3963) and you're being categorical about that  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3965) then why speak about god's attributes in  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3967) the cast in conceptual ways that we can  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3969) only register conceptually  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3972) what's the link here between  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3973) universals and like conceptionism i  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3976) don't understand this  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3977) conceptualism is basically is different  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3979) to nominalism and so much as  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3980) conceptualists doesn't deny the  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3982) existence of universals but it just says  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3984) that they're in the mind  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3985) whereas the anomalies says they don't  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3987) exist anywhere  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3988) they don't exist full stop so the reason  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3991) why we're saying that he's a  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3992) conceptualist is because  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3993) he accepts that the existence within he  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=3996) says in the mind  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4000) some kind of conceptions believe that  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4002) universals exist outside of the mind no  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4006) and that's differentiates from normalism  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4007) how again because normalism says they  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4009) just make the statement that oh they  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4011) don't exist at all so they don't caveat  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4013) it with that it's in the mind  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4016) so why would you need universals if  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4018) you're speaking about god  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4020) well no if we're talking about the  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4022) attributes of god  
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4023) like the will of god and so on what is  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4025) that i mean it's not something you can  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4027) subject to a microscope  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4029) you cannot see any you know so how how  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4032) are we speaking about these things  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4034) necessary  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4035) yeah we can say it's necessary but  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4037) necessary  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4039) the thing is  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4040) for example even cena i would say  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4041) something the effect of is like okay  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4042) it's uh he made this distinction between  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4046) sorry  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4052) the absolute existence  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4055) and he says it's absolute because it's  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4057) just there  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4058) okay  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4059) and  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4060) even telling me it's saying it's just  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4061) there in your mind basically  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4065) there is a proximity between what he  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4067) would say and what kant would say or  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4068) even what an atheist would say you know  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4070) can you see this  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4074) proximity it's there in your mind only  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4079) yeah it's there in your mind no this  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4081) idea of the absolute existence is in  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4084) your mind just the idea yeah it's true  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4085) in your mind and this is absolutely just  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4087) necessary  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4088) yes so why is it only in your mind if  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4090) you can prove it logically yeah he's  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4091) saying logical things like you're  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4092) talking about these categories they're  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4094) all in your mind  
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4095) that's exactly what can said  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4097) proposition is not sorry existence is  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4099) not proposition  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4103) existence is not propositional or  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4106) uh  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4107) yeah is that what we said existence is  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4108) not proposition so he's saying that he's  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4110) just took it from entertainment i  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4111) believe i can't prove it now although i  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4113) have the tools to do all time or  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4114) inclination but  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4116) you know i think he's taking it from him  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4118) i do believe so  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4121) is it not proposition  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4123) it's not existence i think something  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4125) like that yeah  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4127) proposition is not uh  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4129) it's not an existence  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4136) did you see the issue but then the  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4138) question is yeah we go back to the  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4140) argument stock arguments that we so  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4142) quite frankly right we give to atheists  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4145) which is well a number is not  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4148) it's not something that you can pirate  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4150) or java you cannot put it under a  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4151) microscope  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4152) the logical framework is not something  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4154) you're planning on a microscope  
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4155) and eventually we'll find this difficult  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4157) in fact that's one of the reasons why  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4158) verification isn't dropped because the  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4161) scientific method itself could not be  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4162) substantiated through the verification  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4163) method  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4164) so this seems to be the weakest part of  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4166) the cosmology i have to have to be  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4167) honest and say this  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4169) um  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4170) but anyone could say anything  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4173) could you and  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4173) a question like how do you prove  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4174) conception is in conception  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4179) yeah but the thing is unless they call  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4180) it conceptualism remember they're not it  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4182) would say we wouldn't call it  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4183) conceptualism you could say that  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4185) sometimes i i adopt the conceptions  
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4186) position and these are the things but  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4188) he's just saying that i don't believe  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4189) these things exist outside your mind  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4192) which are universals they don't exist  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4194) outside your mind  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4197) the only way you can  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4198) affirm that basically this is like allah  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4201) exists it's because you also have the  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4203) additional  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4204) which is  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4206) so for him  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4209) if you can check it for that  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4213) this or this internal uh experiential  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4216) process  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4218) like experimental existences  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4220) like what  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4222) yeah yeah  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4225) it's in that it's lodged there  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4228) but  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4230) the thing is there's a leap of faith  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4231) everywhere  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4232) like  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4233) he's eliminating  
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4235) simulator  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4236) think about it right  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4237) we we start with cosmological starting  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4239) points yeah  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4241) and then you have to start speaking  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4242) conceptually about that which you're not  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4244) the unseen if you like yeah  
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4246) you go from the scene to the unseen and  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4248) you speak about the unseen as if you're  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4250) speaking about the scene  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4252) but he's eliminated okay universals  
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4254) we're not going to speak about them in  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4255) argumentative way but instead of  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4257) argumentative way we're going to talk  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4258) about them in terms of fitra okay  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4260) but this fits our thing  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4262) which obviously we agree with and we  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4263) believe in and all that but  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4265) if you say it's self-evident  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4267) you're still going from scene to unseen  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4269) you're still going to that  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4271) and what what can you say well you know  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4273) you've got all these attributes and we  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4275) sense them in the future  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4277) how can yani then anyway it gives  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4280) a chance for anyone to say anything  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4281) about anything  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4283) i feel this i feel that  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4290) about the truth of the quran  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4291) i don't think this is uh i don't think  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4293) he said this  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4294) because then you can say okay like so  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4295) someone hears the quran and then they  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4297) are they feel okay this must be true  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4298) okay what's here yeah i think in that in  
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4300) that sense he does believe in that  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4302) he does believe in that yeah  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4305) it reminds you of your original state i  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4307) mean you know where is the  
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4309) ayah which says  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4312) uh  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4321) you know that when we took from the  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4323) progeny of adam from his backs the  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4325) the  
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4326) you know the progenies or the souls and  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4329) we said to them am i not your lord and  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4331) he said yes i am we said yes we you are  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4334) our lord and  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4336) in  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4338) that you would say on the day of  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4339) judgment that we were oblivious of this  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4341) heedless of this matter  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4343) so basically and this is  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4347) it's a strong argument he's saying that  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4348) this is self-evident believing in god is  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4350) self-evident you don't actually need a  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4351) single argument  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4353) for his existence all self-evident  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4356) allah he installed it into you you don't  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4358) need a single argument here  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4361) uh but he's not saying therefore i'm not  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4362) gonna make an argument he makes an  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4363) argument which is the infinite regress  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4364) argument which you've all heard before  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4366) it's the same argument the infinite  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4368) regress argument if i were to drink this  
[1:12:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4370) thing and then before i drank it someone  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4372) else and someone yeah  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4374) it's the infinite weaker sign when he's  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4376) saying  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4377) it's infinite it was impossible to  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4379) infinite regret of causes not of things  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4381) do you remember this yeah how would that  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4383) will happen  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4384) uh  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4386) okay  
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4387) now we move on to the final part of this  
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4389) session and the hardest the hardest part  
[1:13:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4390) of the session  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4392) if you didn't think this was hard enough  
[1:13:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4396) but this is you know we've gone level up  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4398) now so we need to be aware of these  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4399) discourses and these things here and  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4408) so let's start by saying  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4410) this is the hardest part of the session  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4412) because uh actually we're in the spirit  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4414) of putting things together okay  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4416) like the past and the present and all  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4418) these kind of things  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4419) i would say the central objection of  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4422) both the cosmological argument and forms  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4424) of contingency argument and even  
[1:13:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4425) sometimes ontological argument almost  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4427) all arguments for god's existence is  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4429) bertrand russell's objection  
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4432) and to who can remember bertrand  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4434) russell's objection to  
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4436) the cosmological argument and  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4438) what is his famous objection  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4443) uh that was he said that as well that's  
[1:14:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4445) true that is that's correct that's one  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4447) of his famous that's the right answer  
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4450) but let me give you a bit more of a hint  
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4452) in terms of um when he was having a  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4455) debate with copeland on the internet on  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4457) the sorry on the radio  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4459) and there was a there was a pivotal  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4461) turning point in the debate it's a very  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4462) famous debate and i don't know what it  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4463) was i'll tell you what year it was the  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4465) debate it was in 19 uh  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4468) what was it  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4469) i don't know what it was but  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4471) i'll find out the year but it was a  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4473) famous debate and this was a pivotal  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4475) turning point because coppelston was  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4476) doing very well in that debate  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4478) and i think he won that a bit actually  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4480) but there was one thing that made  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4481) everyone think  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4482) which was when he said what uh  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4485) i uh but  
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4487) he made the case for the compositional  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4489) fallacy which is that  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4490) just because a part has a certain  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4492) attribute doesn't mean the whole has to  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4494) have that same attribute and you  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4495) remember the exact example that he he  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4497) gave  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4498) yeah um i'm not sure yeah  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4501) well it's something like um  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4503) if we say that every man has a mother it  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4505) doesn't mean that the human race has  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4506) beautiful that's what he said he said  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4508) he says this as if you're saying to me  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4510) yani just because every human being has  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4512) a mother just therefore the human being  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4514) has a mother which is which is what the  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4516) compositional fallacy the famous the  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4518) strongest possible objection to the  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4520) god's argument godly arguments whatever  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4523) which people are it's now in you know  
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4525) text books and all those kind of things  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4526) and we've been through this before but  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4527) let me just remind you of it and it's  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4529) problematic  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4531) why because  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4533) if i say look you've got you know a wall  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4535) here which is made up of small little  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4537) bricks yes and we've said this before  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4539) and i use this example because it's  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4540) pretty straightforward yeah you've got a  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4542) wall that is made up of small bricks  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4549) okay  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4551) but it becomes a big wall  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4553) so the part whole distinction what is it  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4556) is it  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4557) same or different  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4559) okay  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4560) so it's different but what if i say look  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4562) each brick is white  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4564) and the wall is why is it different or  
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4567) the same here  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4568) it's the same so the question is  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4571) when is it different and when is it the  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4573) same do you see  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4575) because if if you say well everything in  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4576) the universe has a cause  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4578) therefore the universe has a cause  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4580) there's two ways we can understand this  
[1:16:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4583) or everything in the universe is  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4584) dependent therefore the universe is  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4585) dependent  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4587) you see there's two ways you can  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4588) understand this it can either be that  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4590) the pothole distinction is  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4591) differentiated  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4595) or it can be what  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4597) the same  
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4600) so how do we know when is what when is  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4602) what  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4603) that's the question  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4605) how do we know that when we're making an  
[1:16:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4607) argument  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4608) that we are not  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4610) committing the fallacy of composition  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4613) when is it a fallacy of composition  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4615) what are principles that must be at play  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4617) for it to be a fallacy of composition or  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4619) when are when is it not the fallacy of  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4621) composition  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4623) so i mean  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4625) nowadays people have tried to  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4627) revisit this and one of the people that  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4629) i read  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4630) who have revisited this is joshua  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4632) rasmussen who i've actually had a  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4633) conversation with i put up online uh  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4636) i should have spoken to him about this  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4637) but i i came across this after  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4640) in his other book because i didn't read  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4642) that book  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4643) that he wrote the other read the other  
[1:17:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4645) book that he wrote then i read this book  
[1:17:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4648) and it was interesting i'm not saying  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4649) it's completely wrong or anything like  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4650) that but i'm saying it's not the best  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4652) and i'll explain what he says  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4654) and what his principles are and uh and  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4657) then we'll talk about him tami's  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4658) contribution to this yeah  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4661) so  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4661) so uh rasmussen  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4664) i'm maybe pronouncing his name all wrong  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4666) but  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4667) he has two principles  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4669) okay he is one of them is called the  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4671) principle of inheritance  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4673) and the other one he calls the principle  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4674) of diffusion okay  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4676) and he says that  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4679) i'll read it he says the future property  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4681) is one which spans arbitrary subsections  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4683) yeah like a marble  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4686) block  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4688) uh  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4690) which sorry  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4693) yeah like a marble block which is true  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4696) that even if broken up into pieces each  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4698) piece will be a marble so if you have a  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4701) marble block  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4704) marble block i don't have anything like  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4705) that here  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4706) if i have a model block  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4710) paper is fine yeah paper should be the  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4712) same right  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4713) if you rip it up yeah it every single  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4716) piece will be white white  
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4719) if white piece of paper i rip it up  
[1:18:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4721) every single piece is going to be on why  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4724) this is it's diffused  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4726) it's a diffuser property which means it  
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4728) spans arbitrary subsections and it's  
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4730) inherited throughout the whole paper  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4733) he says  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4734) so like the marble rock  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4736) if broken up into pieces each piece will  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4738) be marble  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4739) diffuser properties become whole  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4741) inherited by the thing in question yeah  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4743) given the example of a marble floor  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4745) rasamson states that in the case of the  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4747) marble floor the floor inherits some of  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4749) its properties from its parts  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4751) so you inherit it from your parts so  
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4753) because if you put marble floor put tile  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4756) tile tile towel you have now  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4758) a marble floor you know you had marble  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4760) tiles and now it's some other floor so  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4762) the the part and the part contributes  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4765) to the hole  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4767) yes  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4769) from white tiles you get a white floor  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4771) okay same thing with white but you can  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4772) put while it tells to go you have a  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4773) white floor so he's saying here the  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4775) distinction between part to part part to  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4777) whole is same  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4779) yes  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4780) the other property is like for example  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4782) if every part of the marble floor has  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4783) mass so too does the floor similarly if  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4785) uh if the parts are shining glass so two  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4787) is the whole the the  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4789) of consistent fuses are now these are  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4791) the ones he's he he says  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4793) if they're colors textures densities and  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4795) being homogeneous four things he  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4797) mentions yeah so colors textures  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4800) densities and being homogeneous  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4802) one two three four  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4805) one two three four  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4806) so he mentions obviously he doesn't  
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4808) reference it in a book he actually says  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4810) that uh graham oppe who's seen as the  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4813) leading atheist interrogator now  
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4815) or a philosophical interrogator of the  
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4817) god arguments and stuff  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4819) he said he wrote him an email according  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4821) he put his footnote in his book  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4823) but he said that graham opie wrote him  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4825) an email okay  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4826) and that grandma who great mommy by the  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4828) way who and lucy just recently debated  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4830) remember in that debate  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4832) on liberalism and whatever yeah he said  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4834) that graham opie  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4836) attempt to refute the theory by giving  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4837) the example of reflective light look  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4839) reflect reflective light  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4841) is  
[1:20:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4842) in a sense  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4844) it's you cannot say it's part whole  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4845) inherited  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4846) and i thought well you can there's a  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4848) lower laying fruit which is quantum  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4849) physics yanny  
[1:20:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4850) okay if i go for example yeah this piece  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4853) of paper  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4855) if i go into the subatomic particles you  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4857) cannot say it's white  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4860) do you see the point like there's a  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4861) lower laying fruit which i thought yeah  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4863) so if we go with his one two three four  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4865) classifications there's issues still  
[1:21:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4866) with the classification do you see the  
[1:21:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4868) issue here  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4869) so i wasn't fully convinced that  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4871) obviously you can say the quantum world  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4872) to use you need a theory of everything  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4873) before and you can defend this i'm not  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4875) saying this is  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4876) uh unsalvageable i'm not saying that you  
[1:21:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4879) know rasmussen's thing is unsalvageable  
[1:21:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4881) i'm just saying that it's not the best  
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4883) so what i want to do is read to you  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4885) whatever tamiya writes on the issue  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4886) because surprisingly  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4888) before i say what even tamiya says uh  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4890) rasmussen writes in his book he says  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4891) that i am i'm going to tell you  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4893) something which i have not read in any  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4894) book or read in any article like he says  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4897) it's not like him to speak like that you  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4899) know if you know him and his temperament  
[1:21:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4900) so he said i'm going to tell you  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4901) something  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4902) when he talks about this whole part  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4904) whole inheritance and the diffusive  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4905) prophecies versus the inheritance i'm  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4906) going to tell you something which i've  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4908) not read in any book  
[1:21:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4909) or any i've read not i've seen not seen  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4911) in any article yet and he gives us  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4914) these two principles and these four  
[1:21:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4915) things  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4917) and we've seen some of the issues with  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4918) them  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4919) because when is it part whole or when is  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4921) it again when is it the same one is it  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4922) differentiated that's the question still  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4924) we don't have any principles here but  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4926) even tell me it comes to maybe the  
[1:22:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4927) rescue let's take a look at what he says  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4929) i'm going to read out the whole thing  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4930) yeah  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4932) and this might be a mouthful but let's  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4933) just do it anyway it says the principle  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4935) in this regard is that if adding one  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4936) member of a set to another member yields  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4938) a change in the judgment of the set via  
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4939) the second member then the judgment on  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4941) the set will not be comparable to that  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4942) of the individual members  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4944) if the judgment on the set does not  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4946) change with the addition of the second  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4947) member then the judgment on the set will  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4948) be like that of the individual unit  
[1:22:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4951) an example of the first category could  
[1:22:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4953) be found in cases where the addition of  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4956) of one part of uh to another segment of  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4959) the set causes the entire uh set to  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4962) become more  
[1:22:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4964) longer  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4965) or more intense  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4968) okay  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4968) just remember those three things yeah  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4970) more longer more intense or instead of  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4972) what maybe  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4974) maybe extend it yeah extend it because  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4977) extension can be from any direction and  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4978) it doesn't have to be long it could be  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4980) yeah i think it's just usually extended  
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4981) for now yeah  
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4984) in that case the judgment on the set  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4985) cannot be like that on the individual  
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4987) units consequently if it said this is a  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4989) long day this does not mean that each  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4991) part of the day is long  
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4993) okay  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4994) this is in contrast to saying that every  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4995) part of the totality of parts exists or  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4997) does not exist or is contingent  
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=4999) necessary or impossible  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5000) that is because adding an existing thing  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5002) to an existing thing would not prevent  
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5004) an existing thing from becoming existent  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5007) moreover adding a non-existent thing to  
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5009) a non-existent thing would not prevent  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5011) that thing from being non-existent  
[1:23:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5013) adding a contingent thing to an  
[1:23:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5015) impossible thing does not preclude such  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5016) entities from being contingent or  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5018) impossible  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5019) this is in contrast to something which  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5021) is inherently impossible which if needed  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5023) to er which if added to something  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5026) contingent can become contingent as well  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5028) examples in this regard include  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5030) knowledge and life  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5031) and the with the form of being  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5033) impossible unless it is coupled with the  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5034) latter  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5035) or it may be  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5037) one of two opposing things which is  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5039) contingent in and of itself but  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5040) impossible and fused together with other  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5042) with the other concept and this we can  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5044) just discern the difference between the  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5045) continuation of effect which are  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5047) generatable or destructible  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5050) and  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5050) the connection with the existent the  
[1:24:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5053) existence of causes and effects which  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5055) are contingent and infinitely regressive  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5057) thus if a particular originated thing is  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5059) added to another particular originated  
[1:24:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5060) thing this increases the level of  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5061) continuity  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5063) protraction and extension which are not  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5065) established for the individual members  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5066) of the set thus if the set is long  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5068) protracted and continuous such that it's  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5070) characterized by  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5071) muchness  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5073) and intensity this does not necessarily  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5075) mean that each of the um that each of  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5077) the individual members will be tall long  
[1:24:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5080) and continuous such that would be  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5082) described as much and intense having  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5084) causes and their effects in such a seri  
[1:24:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5086) in a  
[1:24:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5088) in a series such that each of them is  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5090) contingent and fused together does not  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5091) prevent such members from being  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5093) contingent this is similar of how having  
[1:24:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5096) things which are non-existent and then  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5098) they're coupling them together with  
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5100) other things that are non-existent will  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5102) not transfer them to non-existent thing  
[1:25:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5104) to inter realm of existence hence the  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5105) adding together of non-existent things  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5107) which are also possible will render them  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5110) existent  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5115) this is on the pages 428 to 432 let me  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5118) explain what's going on here  
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5121) so what's happening is this is a  
[1:25:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5125) he's saying look  
[1:25:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5127) the way you've got a look at it first  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5129) and foremost is that if you add  
[1:25:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5130) something to something and this means  
[1:25:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5133) if you add a part  
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5135) to a hole yeah  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5137) and that increases  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5139) either  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5140) number one  
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5142) the intensity  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5147) the  
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5148) uh what was the other thing that i said  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5149) extension  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5150) or x  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5151) yeah extent it your cause extension  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5155) and the other one was uh muchness yeah  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5158) or just numericalness or whatever  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5162) then that thing is part whole  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5164) differentiated  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5166) does that make sense  
[1:26:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5167) okay let me say this again  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5169) okay  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5170) if i add  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5172) some part of a thing  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5175) to a series of parts  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5178) and then as a result of me adding those  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5180) two things together i get more intensity  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5183) of such thing or i get an extension of  
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5185) such thing or i get  
[1:26:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5187) more of that thing as much as more now  
[1:26:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5191) then that thing is part to hold  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5192) differentiated  
[1:26:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5194) so for example if i add  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5198) bricks  
[1:26:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5199) which are small in size to other bricks  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5201) which are small in size in fact  
[1:26:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5204) the hole is going to be different to the  
[1:26:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5206) part  
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5210) however so the only thing  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5213) that is unsusceptible  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5216) to part whole differentiation  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5219) are things which are unsusceptible to  
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5222) addition and subtraction  
[1:27:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5225) for example  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5227) if i add nothing to nothing let's make  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5229) this very simple  
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5231) what do i have  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5233) nothing  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5234) because nothing is something which is  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5236) unsusceptible to if you add it if you  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5240) add nothing with nothing  
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5242) then you if so if you add it's  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5244) unsusceptible to additional subtraction  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5246) so if you add nothingness to nothingness  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5249) it does not create  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5251) muchness or extension of that thing or  
[1:27:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5253) intensity  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5254) if you add nothing to nothing you have  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5255) you have nothing  
[1:27:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5257) you have nothing actually  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5258) you see you see the  
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5260) going on  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5261) okay if i add  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5264) er  
[1:27:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5267) he gives principles  
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5269) he says it's possible that you can  
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5270) change categories here once again he's  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5271) speaking conceptually yeah  
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5273) he said like for example if you have two  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5274) contingent things you can bring two  
[1:27:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5276) contingent things together and create  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5277) an impossible thing  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5279) for example a tall man is contingent a  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5281) short man is contingent but when you put  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5283) him together it's impossible you can't  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5285) put you cannot have a tall short man  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5290) but the overriding principle you might  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5292) have heard of this many times before is  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5294)  of the loyalty  
[1:28:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5296) something bereft of equality cannot  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5297) produce it  
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5299) if you're bereft of something  
[1:28:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5301) small mom used to say to me  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5303) you know when i whenever i say something  
[1:28:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5304) like you know trying to make a  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5305) contribution or if someone like in in  
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5308) our arab countries this is a very famous  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5310) saying annie if someone says like you  
[1:28:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5312) know i'm going to teach you how to be a  
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5314) man  
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5315) so you say faculty  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5317) something that is  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5318) bereft of something  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5320) you know  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5321) is that  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5322) on the phone  
[1:28:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5324) ali can you hear me brother  
[1:28:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5327) no okay something that is bereft of a  
[1:28:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5329) quality  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5332) cannot cannot produce cannot reduce the  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5334) quality so nothingness is bereft  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5337) of somethingness therefore if you add  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5338) nothingness to nothingness then what  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5340) happens  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5341) then you have nothingness  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5344) so he's saying the same thing now he's  
[1:29:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5346) saying that  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5348) look the only situation where you're  
[1:29:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5349) going to have part whole differentiation  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5352) is if  
[1:29:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5354) by doing so  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5356) or by adding part to whole you have some  
[1:29:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5359) addition somewhere you have some  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5361) addition somewhere  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5365) now he's saying let's go back to another  
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5367) contingency point if you add contingent  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5369) things to contingent things  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5372) he's saying this even tamiya is making  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5373) the contingency argument here  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5375) he said he literally is saying if you  
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5376) put originated and contingent things  
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5378) together  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5379) something like let me give you an exam  
[1:29:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5381) he's not giving this example this is my  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5382) example obviously this is a phone a  
[1:29:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5384) mobile phone  
[1:29:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5387) as you can see i've sealed it up just in  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5389) case someone tries to snatch this and  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5391) that falls from the pocket something  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5392) happens  
[1:29:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5395) you know you have to protect the phone  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5397) this phone requires charge i'm sure your  
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5400) one does as well right you see um  
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5402) unless you have some kind of solo but  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5404) even then there's is solar phones it's  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5406) charged from the sun yeah  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5408) let me tell you what charges on now it's  
[1:30:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5409) on  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5410) how do i find out i don't know what it's  
[1:30:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5412) on  
[1:30:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5413) let's pretend it's 25  
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5415) yeah  
[1:30:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5417) now if i have a phone like this  
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5421) it's dependent on charge  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5423) you understand this point it's very easy  
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5425) no one can deny the point  
[1:30:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5427) okay no problem if i get two phones like  
[1:30:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5429) this  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5431) i get two just like this  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5433) can you show me your phone sorry to say  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5435) i just want to make it visual because  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5437) this is too much this this talking and  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5439) this you know let's just make it easy  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5443) yes  
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5445) there's a clear size differential  
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5452) but  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5453) this is like a kid's phone so what is  
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5455) this what is this  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5457) anyway  
[1:30:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5459) this is 25  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5462) charger your one is 50 55 53 okay  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5467) now  
[1:31:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5468) do these two phones need more charge or  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5470) less charge collectively  
[1:31:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5473) they need more charge collectively yeah  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5475) if i want to power these two phones  
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5477) it's  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5478) it's more i'd need more charge than just  
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5480) powering this one here  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5482) now okay if i bring a third phone to the  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5484) equation third one  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5486) we need more charge or less charge we  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5488) need more charge  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5490) so what are we increasing here  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5494) dependency that's the one that you've  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5496) woken up  
[1:31:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5499) you've completely woken up yesterday so  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5501) the more you put dependencies it would  
[1:31:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5502) take me to say this the more you're  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5504) putting dependent things together  
[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5506) the more you're actually increasing  
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5507) their dependency it's like if you add  
[1:31:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5509) nothing to nothing to nothing it's like  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5510) you have more nothing conceptually  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5512) although  
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5513) nothing's really going on because  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5514) nothing doesn't exist  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5516) but  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5517) you're increasing the dependence you  
[1:31:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5519) have one dependent thing two dependent  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5520) thing three dependent thing four five  
[1:32:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5522) six  
[1:32:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5523) increasing you need more charge now  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5525) if if that wasn't the case then we  
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5526) wouldn't have new power plants  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5528) we say you know what forget about this  
[1:32:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5530) whole thing about you know uh  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5531) electricity and oil and all this that  
[1:32:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5534) because we believe there's a there's a  
[1:32:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5536) there's a point there's a turning point  
[1:32:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5538) when you put dependent things together  
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5540) where it does no required there's no  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5542) requirement for energy or charge or  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5544) dependence it doesn't need anything i  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5546) don't think any nuclear physicists have  
[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5547) said that  
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5549) and there's a reason for this because  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5551) they understand that when you put more  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5552) and more things that read energy  
[1:32:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5553) together you need more charge so even  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5556) tell me that saying the more  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5558) in terms of pothole differentiation  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5560) there is nothing  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5562) independency as a quality to indicate to  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5565) us  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5566) that if you add more and more of it  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5568) together  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5569) that you somehow get necessity  
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5572) because the truth is when you put more  
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5574) dependent things with dependent things  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5575) together  
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5576) the intensity of dependency is increased  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5581) yeah it's a extension of the dependency  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5585) so it's dependency is part whole  
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5591) no it's part whole  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5593) similar  
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5594) it's part hot as a city and just like  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5596) just he's saying look  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5599) look where is the burden of proof  
[1:33:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5601) if i was an atheist and said  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5603) if you put nothing with nothing together  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5605) then you have something like there was  
[1:33:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5607) maybe nothing and then something  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5609) happened there was absolutely nothing  
[1:33:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5610) and then something  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5612) this is the most one of the most  
[1:33:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5614) powerful questions that you can ask an  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5615) atheist why is there something more  
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5617) rather than nothing again why  
[1:33:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5619) if you don't like the why question what  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5621) is the reason  
[1:33:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5623) that there is something  
[1:33:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5624) rather than nothing because someone said  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5625) we look like peter atkins he said i  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5627) don't believe in my questions say okay  
[1:33:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5628) fine i'll change it for you what is the  
[1:33:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5630) reason that there's something rather  
[1:33:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5632) than nothing  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5633) i don't know i don't i'm agnostic  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5635) understand that can some can nothing  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5637) transform into something  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5639) if you add it but nothing nothing  
[1:34:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5641) nothing you're not getting something  
[1:34:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5643) because something bereft of a quality  
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5644) cannot produce it  
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5646) unless  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5648) it can only not produce it unless  
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5653) if you added a part of it to another  
[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5655) part  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5656) that it would be increased in intensity  
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5658) extension or muchness that's the only  
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5660) exception to the so the rule is  
[1:34:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5662) something bereft of a quality cannot  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5664) produce it the exception is  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5666) unless if you add a part to it  
[1:34:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5669) to another part and it produces more  
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5671) intensity extension or muchness  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5673) that's that's our postulation you have  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5675) to show us you have to demonstrate and  
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5677) tell me i would say  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5679) as an empiricist not really an impetus  
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5681) but someone who likes the cosmological  
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5683) method so you have to demonstrate it  
[1:34:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5685) scientifically show it to me  
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5687) that if you can add something which is a  
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5689) contingent  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5690) or something which needs something  
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5692) dependent with something which is  
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5693) dependent and you keep adding it that  
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5695) somehow the dependency is eliminated or  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5698) is absorbed  
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5701) it's not  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5703) it's not going to happen  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5704) and so he he solves this issue  
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5707) you see he's saying something the the  
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5709) main principle is this something bereft  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5712) of equality cannot produce it the  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5714) exception is unless  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5716) by adding a part  
[1:35:18](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5718) to another part of it  
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5720) it produces an increase in intensity  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5722) extension or muchness  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5724) so going back to bertrand russell's  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5726) thing  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5727) he'll say bertrand are you talking about  
[1:35:29](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5729) my friend yeah  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5730) he won't say he's my friend  
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5732) he'll he will he might he may say  
[1:35:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5734) actually when you say the human human  
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5737) you know  
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5738) race has a mother  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5739) what do you mean by that because how can  
[1:35:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5741) the human race have a mother unless  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5743) you're talking about some kind of  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5744) neoplatonic universal category which we  
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5746) believe we both believe you as an  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5748) atheist in me as iblitamia that these  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5750) categories don't even exist in the first  
[1:35:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5751) place  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5752) so that's unintelligible proposition but  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5754) then he'll go further and say look  
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5757) if you're saying that the human race has  
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5758) another meaning that there was one  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5760) mother that started there was one woman  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5761) that started the human race there's  
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5762) nothing wrong with that that's not  
[1:36:03](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5763) logically inconsistent at all why is  
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5765) that illogically inconsistent that was a  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5767) first human being no issue but if you  
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5769) mean by that that there's a part whole  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5771) differentiation and that that is  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5773) unsubstantiated because of the  
[1:36:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5774) compositional fallacy  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5776) then  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5776) the the he would say the argument i put  
[1:36:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5779) forward to you bertrand russell is that  
[1:36:21](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5781) something bereft of equality cannot  
[1:36:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5783) produce it unless if you add a part to  
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5786) another part of it it will increase in  
[1:36:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5788) intensity muchness or extension and in  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5790) the case of dependency we have no  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5792) evidence  
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5793) of any of those things at all  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5796) so it's upon you atheist to pr to  
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5799) produce the evidence so he switched out  
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5801) the burden of proof  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5804) just like an atheist saying what  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5806) an atheist saying  
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5808) something can come from nothing  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5809) it goes back to the aid of the quran and  
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5811) everything does to be honest with you it  
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5812) does  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5813) and this shows you this priority of the  
[1:36:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5815) quranic discourse  
[1:36:57](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5817) has they been created from nothing or  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5818) were they themselves the creators of  
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5820) themselves the whole argument this the  
[1:37:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5822) depths of this argument goes back to the  
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5824) ayah  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5825) which is that  
[1:37:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5826) you cannot have something from nothing a  
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5829) and something cannot reduce itself  
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5832) a dependent thing cannot bring itself  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5834) into existence  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5837) so  
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5839) how do you do how do you how do you now  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5840) and i think this is his defining  
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5842) contribution and it's better than what  
[1:37:23](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5843) rasmussen says because rasmussen in many  
[1:37:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5845) ways he's making he's saying that  
[1:37:27](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5847) the difference between what rasmussen is  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5848) saying is that these four things colors  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5850) textures and whatever you know i can't  
[1:37:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5852) remember the other ones  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5853) homogeneity and the and um  
[1:37:37](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5857) one other thing which i forget now  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5859) uh  
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5860) being homogeneous diffuse uh sorry  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5862) identity is the four things he's saying  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5865) four things in many ways there's a you  
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5867) can see there's a flesh that joins the  
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5868) two ideas which is what something that  
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5870) grows right or something which can  
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5872) spread but the opposite here is that  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5874) he's saying anything with those four  
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5875) things  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5876) is diffusive we're not saying everything  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5878) with those four things is diffusive  
[1:38:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5880) we're going negative we're starting by  
[1:38:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5882) saying something bereft of a quality  
[1:38:05](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5885) cannot produce it unless if you add a  
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5888) part to it to another part it produces a  
[1:38:10](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5890) different hole  
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5894) a different hole  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5896) and so he  
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5897) he effectively in a sense i i personally  
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5900) believe until proven otherwise that he  
[1:38:22](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5902) solves the biggest quandary of the uh  
[1:38:25](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5905) the um  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5906) arguments of god's existence one of the  
[1:38:28](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5908) biggest ones and i've not seen this kind  
[1:38:30](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5910) of level of uh assessment  
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5912) in uh to be fair i've not seen it  
[1:38:34](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5914) anywhere  
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5915) you know i think this is the final  
[1:38:36](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5916) contribution to the whole thing and it's  
[1:38:38](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5918) put in manhattan's son or something  
[1:38:39](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5919) which is talking about the shia it's a  
[1:38:41](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5921) bit of an unusual place to put it to put  
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5922) it with you well that's why you have to  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5924) in order to know open tamiya's  
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5926) positions you have to have a wide  
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5929) reading of hypnotamia and today we've  
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5930) seen the great mind of him tamiya in  
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5932) action we've critiqued some of his  
[1:38:54](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5934) theories and we've also taken some of  
[1:38:56](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5936) what he said on board and i think we can  
[1:38:58](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5938) easily take what he said into arguments  
[1:39:00](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5940) with atheistic detractors who don't  
[1:39:02](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5942) believe in god's existence and  
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5944) especially on the main objections of  
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5946) god's existence relating to but not  
[1:39:08](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5948) limited to the compositional fallacy  
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/wShrJLpj0mk?t=5951) and with that i conclude
