## Description

Seminar: Does Islam curtail freedom? An analytical approach - with Hamza Andreas Tzortzis

Islam means submission to God. However, does that mean Islam curtails people's freedoms? Does freedom simply mean the absence of coercion, or is there more to the idea? Does Islam liberate people? What ideological assumptions do we hold and how do they effect our understanding of the topic? Please join this live seminar that aims to provide analytical answers to these questions and more.

The seminar discusses the idea of freedom and how Islam promotes it. It covers the philosophical concept of freedom, coercion and rights, and why the empirical account of freedom is incoherent. It then goes on to discuss why the Islamic conception of rights is more robust and how it is connected to the Quran and prophetic traditions.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=0)** This seminar discusses the idea of freedom and how Islam promotes it. It covers the philosophical concept of freedom, coercion and rights, and why the empirical account of freedom is incoherent. It then goes on to discuss why the Islamic conception of rights is more robust and how it is connected to the Quran and prophetic traditions.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=300)** This seminar addresses the question of whether Islam restricts freedom. The presenter provides a brief overview of the history of the concept of freedom, and discusses the Islamic conception of freedom. He then goes on to discuss the implications of this conception on human rights.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=600)** This seminar discusses the concept of freedom and its relation to Islam. argues that freedom is centered around the idea of the absence of coercion, and goes on to discuss thought experiments which demonstrate this point. He also discusses the idea of worship, describing it as knowing something the most and focusing one's life around it.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=900)* Discusses the philosophical idea of freedom, and how Islam supports it. It argues that, in order to be free, one must be free from coercion, which is the absence of force used to control someone. Islam supports this idea by stating that, to worship Allah, one must be free from coercion.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=1200)* Discusses the two theories of coercion: the empirical theory, which states that a person is coerced when they have no reasonable alternative, and the non-empirical theory, which states that a person is not coerced even if they have no reasonable alternative. He cites the example of a person being forced to take the left road in order to avoid a tornado. According to the non-empirical theory, the person is still free because their rights have not been violated.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=1500)** Serena Osaretti postulates that a person can be coerced if they have no other reasonable choice, but that in this case, their freedom is curtailed. She argues that this is impractical from a social political perspective, but is important to understand the specific choice a person makes in order to determine if they are coerced.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=1800)* Discusses the debate over whether Islam curtails freedom. Hamza Andreas Tzortzis argues that, according to the rights-based approach, Islam does not curtail freedom because the patient has no other option than to sign the consent form.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=2100)* Discusses how freedom is really about rights, and how the conception of rights a person has can impact how free they are. explains that both negative and positive conceptions of rights exist, and how libertarians argue that positive rights can actually be against freedom.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=2400)* Discusses the concept of freedom and how it is different based on a person's conception of rights. He points out that Islam has its own conception of rights, which preserves individuals' freedom. Therefore, Islam does not tell freedom.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=2700)* Discusses the Islamic conception of rights and how it does not restrict freedom. It goes on to discuss how this understanding comes from the fact that Islam comes from God, who is the source of all good and is the source of all rights. It then goes on to discuss how the Islamic understanding of rights is the correct conception, and how anyone can understand this if they are willing to think critically.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=3000)** argues that, because Islam upholds certain principles of human rights, Muslims are actually free. This is contrary to the libertarian view, which assumes that freedom is the absence of coercion.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=3300)** The presenter discusses how Islam preserves freedom, and how if someone can prove that Islam has its own conception of rights, they are free from the idea of freedom.

argues that Islam does not curtail freedom, but rather that the rights given by Allah are true due to who Allah is.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71jEgL9tR1g&t=3600)* Discusses Islam's conception of rights and how it comes from a true argument. They go on to say that even if a right is given by Allah, it is still true due to who Allah is.

[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=14) this is andres joses and today we're  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=16) going to be covering the question  
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=19) does islam curtail freedom  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=22) and we're going to use an analytical  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=24) approach  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=26) now the first thing i want to say is  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=27) that i pray that every single one is  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=30) with good health and high faith high  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=33) iman  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=34) and i pray to allah that  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=37) he accepts  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=39) today's seminar and that it is  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=42) effective and makes an impact in your  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=46) individual and public lives especially  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=49) in the context of  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=50) sharing islam academically and  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=52) intellectually which is a key focus of  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=55) sapience institute we really want to  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=58) get people to  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=61) understand the importance of sharing  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=62) islam intellectually and academically  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=64) but also for them to be empowered to do  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=66) so  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=67) and this is very important because we  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=69) want to see a world  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=71) that  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=73) that  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=74) basically has the message of islam that  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=76) they are given the message of islam and  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=78) that  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=79) in our world  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=80) you have people who are able to share  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=82) islam academically and intellectually so  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=86) today's question is does islam can tell  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=88) freedom we're going to use an analytical  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=89) approach and we're going to basically  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=91) cover the following points today  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=94) the first thing is we're going to cover  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=95) why this discussion is important  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=97) and obviously i want to elaborate on the  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=100) existential spiritual dimension of  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=102) freedom i'm not going to get into it too  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=103) much because we have a previous  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=105) seminar called  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=107) born to worship which really unpacks  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=109) that further but i just wanted to speak  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=111) about because it's very important  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=113) then we're going to talk about the idea  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=114) of freedom and by the way we're not  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=115) talking about we're not talking about  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=117) political conceptions of freedom at this  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=119) stage we're talking about the  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=120) philosophical idea of freedom rather  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=123) than political conceptions and there is  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=124) a distinction here  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=126) so we're going to talk about freedom and  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=128) coercion  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=129) and we're going to articulate why and  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=132) under the understanding of freedom is  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=135) basically the the fact that you don't  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=136) have  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=137) coercion that there is an absence of  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=139) coercion and then we're going to unpack  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=141) what coercion actually means  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=143) then we're going to talk about the two  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=145) main theories the non-empirical account  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=147) and the empirical account  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=150) now  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=151) after that we're going to talk about why  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=153) the empirical account is incoherent and  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=155) why the non-empirical account is  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=157) actually more robust  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=159) and it's going to show us that freedom  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=162) is really connected to rights that  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=164) freedom  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=165) is when your rights have not been  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=167) violated  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=169) and  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=170) that's easy to say now but we're going  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=172) to go through this kind of intellectual  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=173) journey to show you why  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=175) freedom is really just about rights  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=179) and if your rights are not violated then  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=181) you're free if they are violated then  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=183) you're not free you've been subjugated  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=185) or you're oppressed from that  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=186) perspective but this raises a very  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=188) important philosophical question well  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=191) what set of rights  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=193) because there are different conception  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=194) of rights you have the kind of positive  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=196) view of rights the negative your  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=197) negative view of rights like the  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=199) libertarians and you have the positive  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=201) view of rights like the socialists for  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=203) example then you have the islamic  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=204) conception of rights so  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=206) what is  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=208) the correct set of rights and if you  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=210) understand that correctly then you  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=211) understand  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=212) when you are free and when you are not  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=214) free when you have been subjugated when  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=215) you are not subjugated  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=218) so we're going to be able to answer the  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=219) question does islam couture freedom in a  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=221) very easy way because islam gives us  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=223) rights and if those rights are not  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=225) violated  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=226) then you're free and islam also has  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=228) mechanisms in place to preserve those  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=230) rights and to protect those rights  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=232) so by definition islam  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=236) gives you freedom right  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=239) but the question that's very important  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=241) is actually a dollar question and that's  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=243) what we're going to focus on at the end  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=245) is to get you to realize not to fall for  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=247) the wrong for for the trap  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=250) i'm not saying it's a deliberate trap  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=251) but in some cases cases is but you don't  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=254) want to basically  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=255) adopt a conception of rights that is  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=258) alien to the islamic tradition  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=260) and you don't adopt therefore a  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=262) conception of freedom that is against  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=264) the islamic tradition because islam  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=267) is a world view  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=268) islam  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=270) has its own understanding of rights yes  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=272) there are overlaps and there are  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=274) commonalities for sure i'm not saying  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=276) you know it's night and day difference  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=278) of course not there are some you know  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=281) there is some common commonality and  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=283) some shared understanding of rights but  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=286) the point here is we have a fundamental  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=289) you know  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=290) different philosophical theo  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=293) philosophical intellectual basis the  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=294) quran the prophetic traditions and our  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=297) conception of rights come from that  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=299) intellectual tradition that intellectual  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=301) foundation we could prove that  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=302) foundation to be true so in endower  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=304) context we're going to get you basically  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=306) to take intellectual leadership  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=308) and not to basically adopt false  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=310) assumptions or the wrong assumptions  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=312) because when you do that especially in a  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=314) dial context when you're sharing islam  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=316) intellectually academically when you do  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=318) that what happens it creates a lot of  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=319) inconsistencies  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=321) and you actually start to contradict  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=323) islam itself  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=324) so it's very important for us to have  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=326) this kind of intellectual courage and  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=327) leadership to be able to show to people  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=329) okay well what do you mean by freedom  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=331) freedom is the absence of coercion and  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=333) the absence of coercion really means the  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=335) non-violation of rights and this raises  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=338) the question of what set of rights  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=340) are the right  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=342) set of rights to have  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=344) and that would allow you to link it to  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=346) the essence of islam which is tawheed  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=348) affirming the oneness of allah  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=350) submission to a submission to allah  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=353) and you'll be able to link it to the  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=354) intellectual foundations of islam to  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=356) prove that the quran is true and allah  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=358) exists and so on and so forth and to  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=360) show them that our rights come from this  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=362) intellectual foundation  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=364) and which is true and whatever comes  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=366) from truth is true so you could use this  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=368) question to give them a correct  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=370) understanding of rights which is the  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=371) islamic conception  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=373) and also to show how islam is true at  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=375) this in the same in the at the same time  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=378) now obviously you this is just a summary  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=381) but i just wanted to take you to what  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=383) we're going to be covering today  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=385) so first thing to understand is why is  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=387) this discussion very important well  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=390) there are a few reasons why this  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=391) discussion is very important you have  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=393) you know lots of ideological attacks in  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=395) our current social political environment  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=397) against islam you have politicians and  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=399) ideologues the frame the discussion as  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=402) the free world versus the unfree world  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=405) and the unfree world is the muslim or  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=407) the islamic world right  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=409) and you have this a lot  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=411) and you know these ideologues and  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=413) politicians you know they don't really  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=415) mean that what they mean is  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=418) the liberal world and the non-liberal  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=420) world generally speaking right that's  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=423) what they mean they don't mean free and  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=424) unfree  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=425) um now that they might do in certain  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=427) cases because in some parts of the world  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=429) there is subjugation and oppression for  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=430) sure obviously it's not always black and  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=432) white but the point here is that what  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=434) they really mean here is a liberal  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=436) conception of freedom right what they  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=438) mean here is you know secular liberal  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=440) values versus non-secular values they're  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=442) not necessarily they may do sometimes  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=444) but they don't necessarily mean free  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=446) world versus the unfree world right  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=448) because they have a particular  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=449) conception of freedom  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=450) which is based on their own  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=452) philosophical foundations and it's based  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=453) on their own conception of rights  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=455) nevertheless they frame the discussion  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=457) in that way and it affects the kind of  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=460) discourse right it affects the  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=461) perception of islam and muslims  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=463) specifically the islamic tradition  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=466) you know you have a picture here of  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=468) this  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=469) this incoherent and  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=471) immoral individual called gert wilders  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=474) he's the dutch  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=476) politician the right-wing politician he  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=477) said i believe that islam and freedom  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=480) are incompatible and if you unpack that  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=482) philosophically what he's trying to say  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=483) is islam and you know  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=486) my  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=487) version of secular liberal values or or  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=490) my version of rights are incompatible  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=492) with islam right that's what he's trying  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=494) to say  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=495) and from that perspective and you can  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=496) understand that a little in a few  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=498) minutes when we unpack this idea further  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=501) also  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=502) you know there are social psychological  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=504) implications as well because you know  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=506) sometimes some of our  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=507) you know  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=509) the muslims our brothers and sisters in  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=511) our community what they do sometimes  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=512) they like to react to concepts so they  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=514) will be like no islam hates freedom  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=516) right islam is anti-free which is in my  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=519) view a very kind of  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=520) incoherent and  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=522) not very wise  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=524) or even  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=525) rational approach to this topic right  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=528) you know  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=529) don't define yourself by just reacting  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=531) to everything you know it's that's not  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=534) how you  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=535) articulate a positive case for is for  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=537) the islamic tradition because when you  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=539) understand the context that we're living  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=540) in and i'm talking from a kind of  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=542) western context people living in the  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=543) west or people living in an environment  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=545) where there is non-muslims where you  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=546) know articulate islam compassionate  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=548) intellect and and intelligently to them  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=550) when you live in that type of  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=551) environment you know you have to  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=553) understand the connotations of terms you  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=555) have to understand the social  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=556) psychological implications and you have  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=558) to have hikma you have to have wisdom  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=560) so  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=561) just you know if for example there's  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=563) this idea of freedom you know uh in in a  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=566) certain culture  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=567) don't be sitting and say oh no we don't  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=569) believe in freedom that's ridiculous  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=571) because that's not even even in line  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=573) with islamic tradition anyway especially  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=574) what you're to learn today it's all  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=576) about rights right are you going to say  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=579) that islam doesn't promote rights that's  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=580) a ridiculous thing to do because in in  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=582) the classical tradition you even have  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=584) the concept of  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=586) the rights of the individuals you have  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=589) the understanding of you know preventing  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=591) oppression and subjugation and so on and  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=593) so forth you have the understanding of  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=595) the rights  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=596) of the wife the rights of the family the  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=598) rights of allah the rights of animals  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=600) the rights of non-muslims the rights of  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=602) your fellow human beings this is a these  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=605) these ethics and and these principles  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=607) are embedded in our tradition are you  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=609) going to reject rights because what  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=610) you're going to learn today is that  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=611) freedom and coercion is fundamentally  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=613) about rights so if you say no there is  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=615) no freedom in islam well you're actually  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=617) rejecting islam from that perspective  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=619) because  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=620) you know  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=621) it's equivalent of rejecting the notion  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=624) of rights which would be a ridiculous  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=625) thing to do  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=626) so don't react ideologically in that way  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=628) be nuits understand what the quran is  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=630) actually say and respond properly and  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=632) that's why from a social psychological  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=634) point of view you need to understand  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=636) that in liberal societies people value  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=638) this idea of freedom even in a popular  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=640) sense even if it's incoherent you know  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=641) for example you have this kind of you  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=643) know popular idea of that  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=646) one can do what they like as long as  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=649) they don't hurt anyone which is a  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=651) philosophically not very nuanced notion  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=654) or principle because how do you know the  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=656) implications of your action  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=658) uh on society and on individuals  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=662) now  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=663) and in the medium to long-term future  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=665) you just don't know right  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=667) right you might not harm someone  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=668) immediately but how do you know that for  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=670) example your particular action now  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=672) doesn't create some kind of harm so you  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=674) know it is a kind of uh  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=677) unknown notion but it's a popular notion  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=679) and even the idea of her what does what  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=681) does harm mean right  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=682) you know how do you define harm right  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=685) individual collective harm what is harm  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=688) and so on and so forth so there's a big  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=689) philosophical discussions here but  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=690) anyway notwithstanding i'm trying to  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=692) show to you there is a social political  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=694) atmosphere where people value freedom  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=697) and you don't want to be you know  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=699) antagonistic to it in a way that's  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=700) ideological because this is not the  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=702) islamic way of doing things  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=704) you need to appreciate this idea and use  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=706) hikma and wisdom and show to them yes we  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=709) agree one should be free but what do you  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=711) mean by freedom  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=713) and then you could articulate what we're  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=715) going to be talking about today well  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=717) freedom is centered around the idea of  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=719) the absence of coercion but let's let's  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=722) be nuanced and understand what this  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=723) really means well really the absence of  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=725) coercion is not having um  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=729) is is about the non-violation of rights  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=732) right  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=733) it's about the non-violation rights it's  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=735) not about having you know the best  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=737) possible options available right  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=740) and we're going to show some thought  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=741) experiments to show that you can be  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=742) basically  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=744) somehow forced to take a particular  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=746) option  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=747) and that's not the option that you  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=748) wanted to choose and it has negative  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=751) consequences but it doesn't mean you're  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=752) coerced you're only coerced if  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=756) someone has violated or an entity has  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=758) violated your rights and we're going to  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=759) discuss what we mean by this  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=763) so before we get into the philosophical  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=765) idea of freedom and unpack what i've  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=766) just said  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=768) i think it's very important to  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=769) understand that there are different kind  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=771) of perspectives on liberty and freedom  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=774) and there is a very powerful perspective  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=777) which is an existential spiritual  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=778) perspective which i really just want to  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=780) summarize but if you want to know more  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=782) about this go to the seminar that's on  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=784) our youtube channel it's called  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=787) born to worship and i think i delivered  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=789) that about six weeks ago or something  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=793) and  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=794) what is this idea let's summarize this  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=795) idea well basically essentially everyone  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=797) is enslaved right you have this  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=799) existential slavery from that  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=800) perspective and and this kind of  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=802) argument is derived from the quran in  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=804) chapter 12 verse 87 when allah says  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=809) god puts forward this illustration can a  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=812) man who has for his masters several  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=814) partners that odds with each other be  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=815) considered equal to a man devoted holy  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=818) to one master all praise belongs to god  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=821) to allah though most of them do not know  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=824) so this argument is derived from that  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=825) because where is allah was subhanallah  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=827) essentially telling us here so let's  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=829) ponder over this verse  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=831) what's interesting allah is trying to  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=833) say to us that if you don't worship  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=835) allah the one who knows you better than  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=836) you know yourself has more affection for  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=838) you than your own mother's right who is  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=841) the source of a goodness who's the one  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=842) who's actually worthy of servitude the  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=845) one who's worthy of worship if you don't  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=846) worship him you're gonna worship many  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=849) other  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=850) slave masters or deities and they are  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=852) they're crawling with one another they  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=854) don't really know what's good for you  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=856) right  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=856) they don't have the same affection for  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=858) you  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=859) and so on and so forth and this is why  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=861) it's it's very critical to understand  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=863) what this means from an existential  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=865) perspective allah is basically telling  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=867) us that you can't run away from the idea  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=868) that you're going to be at service to  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=870) something you're going to worship  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=871) something as there is the muslim thinker  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=874) martin ling's he said man cannot not  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=878) worship meaning man is in a state of  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=880) worship whether they believe in god or  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=881) not  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=882) now for you to understand this you have  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=883) to  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=884) have to unpack what worship actually  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=886) means or entails  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=887) now worship means to know something the  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=889) most which is really to focus on  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=891) something the most and and  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=893) and to  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=894) you know really revolve your life around  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=897) something the most is to love something  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=899) the most is to obey something the most  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=901) it's direct acts of worship like  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=903) gratitude ultimate gratitude and  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=905) ultimate praise to something the most  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=908) obviously from the islamic perspective  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=910) we want to know allah we want a lot we  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=912) want to love allah the most and we love  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=914) allah the muslim we want to we want to  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=916) we have to obey allah the most and we  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=919) believe that we have to direct all acts  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=921) of worship to allah alone the internal  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=923) acts of worship the actions of the heart  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=925) and the external actual worships like  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=927) the actions of the limbs  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=928) and obviously the actions of the limbs  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=930) also have an internal element as well  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=931) because you have to have the correct  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=933) intention and so on and so forth but  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=935) basically the external internal acts of  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=937) worship must be directed to allah alone  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=941) now if you don't worship allah  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=943) you're going to be worshiping something  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=944) else for example an ideology a celebrity  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=948) a  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=949) a culture  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=950) a nationality or whatever the case may  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=952) be the point is you're going to be  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=954) basically worshipping something the most  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=957) because it won't be one thing it might  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=960) be many things take for example you  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=962) might be  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=962) in love with their right wing  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=965) nationalist ideology right and all you  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=968) want to do is know about the history of  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=970) your nation  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=971) and your whole focus revolves around the  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=974) idea of you know your  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=977) your nation or your ethnicity and so on  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=979) and so forth and you love it the most to  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=982) the degree that you break natural  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=984) relationships  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=985) because of your ideological uh  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=988) infatuation right you know you won't be  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=991) friends with decent human beings or you  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=994) may break  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=995) family relations because they don't have  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=997) the same nationalistic right-wing ideas  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=999) as you and that shows that you love this  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1001) ideology more than you love people that  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1003) you should love right  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1005) and you would obey  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1006) the dictates of the ideology  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1010) what it basically you know wants from  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1012) you or even the kind of uh figureheads  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1014) or the symbolic figureheads like  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1017) politicians or the representatives of  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1019) this ideology if they tell you to do  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1020) something you would do it almost in this  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1022) kind of blind obedience right so you'd  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1025) obey the dictates of the ideology the  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1027) most more than anything else and you  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1029) direct acts of worship maybe you won't  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1031) pray  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1033) maybe you're an atheist but you're gonna  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1034) have ultimate gratitude for the nation  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1036) you know and you're going to have  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1038) extensive praise for the representatives  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1040) of this ideology you're going to have  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1042) extensive praise  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1044) for you know the nation itself and the  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1046) right-wing ideology that so from that  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1048) perspective  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1050) you know you're basically worshiping  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1052) this right-wing ideology  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1054) now  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1055) to unpack this further please go to the  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1057) seminar that we delivered which is  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1059) called born to worship but this is just  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1061) like a summary so the point here is in  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1064) order to attain this liberation to be  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1067) truly free is that you have to worship  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1069) allah because if you don't worship allah  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1072) you're going to be worshiping something  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1073) else or something else or some things  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1075) else right you're going to be worshiping  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1077) many other things that then they don't  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1079) know what's good for you they're not the  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1080) source of oh goodness they don't have  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1081) the same affection for you and so on and  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1084) so forth so from that perspective  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1086) if you don't worship allah you're  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1088) worshiping something else and what's  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1089) very interesting the arabic word for  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1091) soul in the quran is  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1094) and the word  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1095) shares the same root as the word  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1097) which means liberty and ease so it's as  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1101) if the  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1102) soul can only achieve that liberty and  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1104) ease if it connects itself and is  
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1107) enslaved and is that service to the one  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1110) that created it to create the soul  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1113) to to worship allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1116) because if you don't worship worship  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1117) allah you're worshiping something else  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1119) and that's just a summary from that  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1120) perspective to show that you know you  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1122) know human beings cannot not worship so  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1125) choose your worship and if you worship  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1127) allah then you're truly liberated if you  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1129) don't worship allah then you're enslaved  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1130) to the shackles or all of other these  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1133) other forced deities if you like it  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1136) could even be yourself as allah says in  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1137) the quran have you not seen no one who  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1138) take his own desires as his lord you  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1140) could have this egocentric  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1142) megalomaniac kind of approach to  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1145) yourself and life uh you could be a  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1148) narcissist you know that's a form of  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1150) self-worship right  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1151) you could you could worship other human  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1153) beings allah says you know don't be like  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1155) those who who who took their rabbis and  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1157) their monks as their lords  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1159) so you know i do worship it's not just  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1161) about buying down to an idol it's also  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1164) the the worship of you know that you  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1166) could worship concepts or other people  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1168) or even yourself  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1170) but  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1171) that's a summary i want to get into too  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1172) much please watch that seminar born to  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1175) born to worship which really unpacks  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1178) this much further  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1180) so  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1181) freedom and coercion the philosophical  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1183) idea of freedom so the coherent and  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1186) uncontroversial definitions of freedom  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1188) are really centered on the idea of the  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1190) absence of coercion so in order to  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1192) understand freedom  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1194) you have to understand what coercion is  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1196) not only that in order to respond to the  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1198) question does islam can tell freedom is  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1200) islam anti-freedom  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1202) you have to understand what coercion is  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1205) so there are two main theories when it  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1207) comes to coercion you have the empirical  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1209) theories  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1210) and the non-empirical theories and by  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1212) the way i've termed it myself  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1214) non-empirical theories only because one  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1216) of them is called empirical theory so i  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1218) just felt the other one should be called  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1219) non-empirical theories you don't have to  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1221) call it non-empirical theories but it's  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1222) just for ease okay  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1224) so you have the empirical theories and  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1226) the non-empirical theories so the  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1227) empirical theories define coercion  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1230) from the point of view  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1232) that a person has no reasonable  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1234) alternative or choice  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1236) but to act in accordance with what  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1239) another person or entity has asked for  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1242) okay  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1242) now according to the non-empirical  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1244) theories of coercion  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1246) the person may have no reasonable option  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1249) but still remains uncoerced is still  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1252) free  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1253) so one theory of coercion basically says  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1257) you don't you're not allowed to make the  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1259) choices that you want  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1261) essentially the other theory of coercion  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1263) it says no  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1264) you may be forced in some way to make  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1267) choices that you don't want to make but  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1269) you're still free  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1271) and i basically focus on these two  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1273) elements of these two theories because  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1274) it's important when we unpack in a few  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1276) moments  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1277) in order for you to understand this  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1279) point further  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1280) so let's start with the non-empirical  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1282) account okay  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1284) so  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1284) the late harvard university professor  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1286) robert nozick he argued for the  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1288) non-empirical account of coercion just  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1290) to remind you  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1291) in the literature from my understanding  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1293) it's not called the non-empirical  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1294) account but i've called it that just to  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1296) contrast the empirical account with the  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1298) non-empirical account okay  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1300) so nautic was concerned with the notion  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1302) of whether a person's actions are  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1303) voluntary in the context of facing  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1306) severely limited options okay  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1308) so what is his basic argument he  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1310) basically argues that look to understand  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1313) if someone is coerced  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1314) you have to understand  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1316) what limits the person's alternatives  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1319) okay what limits the person's choices so  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1321) if you want to understand coercion and  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1323) therefore freedom you have to understand  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1325) what limits the person's choices  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1328) so let's understand the context here  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1330) with an example say for instance  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1333) one of the limiting factors is an act of  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1335) nature so me as a free agent as a free  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1338) human being i'm walking down i'm hiking  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1341) and i wanna and i meet a fork in the  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1342) road there's a road that's going left  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1345) and a road that's going right  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1347) i freely choose to go right i want to go  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1350) right but what happens is my friend  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1352) calls me and basically says there is a  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1355) tornado coming from that coming towards  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1357) that direction  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1358) so now i am forced in some way to  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1362) actually take  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1363) the left road the left fork or the left  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1366) part uh the left direction  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1369) now according to nausic  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1371) because now you've been limited in your  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1373) choices  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1375) you're still not  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1376) you're still not coerced you're still  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1378) free  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1379) why because your rights have not been  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1382) violated  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1383) okay  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1384) so nordic argued that someone is coerced  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1387) to do something if it is based on other  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1390) people's actions placing limits on one  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1393) available opportunities but in what way  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1396) that they would they would be coercive  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1398) if they did not have a right to act in  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1400) that particular way and if they violated  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1403) your rights  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1404) and this is very important to understand  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1406) so let's go through nausic's thought  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1408) experiment  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1409) which i have written down here to read  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1411) out as well  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1412) and notice thought experiment is is very  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1415) smart and shows  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1417) that just because you have  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1419) you have factors that limit your choices  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1421) and your maybe co forced rather to make  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1424) a particular choice that  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1426) is not your ideal choice or so it's a  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1428) choice that you didn't want to make it  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1430) doesn't mean you're not free it doesn't  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1432) mean you've been coerced now  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1434) okay  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1435) as long as your rights have not been  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1437) violated and the limiting factors on  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1440) your choices  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1441) that agency or those people that put  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1444) those limiting factors on your choices  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1446) they didn't act in a way  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1448) that they they were not allowed to act  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1450) in that particular way okay  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1452) that they basically  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1454) have not  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1456) uh they they did not that they acted in  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1459) a way that it was in accordance to their  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1460) rights that they did not it's not the  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1463) case that they acted in a way that they  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1464) had no right to act in that way that's  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1466) basically the point yeah  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1468) so let's read the  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1471) the the thought experiment it's a very  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1472) good thought experiment so he knows it  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1475) basically articulates the thought  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1476) experiment in this way he says there are  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1478) 26 men and 26 women who are seeking  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1482) spouses then when they get married  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1484) so both sex groups are ranked  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1487) one group has been ranked a to z  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1490) and the other a apostrophe to zed  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1493) apostrophe okay  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1495) now the ranking is based on their  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1497) marital appeal right then marital appeal  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1502) a  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1503) and a apostrophe decide to marry each  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1506) other  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1507) however  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1508) b has also considered a apostrophe as  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1510) the person that they would most like to  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1513) marry but given that a apostrophe is now  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1515) married  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1516) b marries b apostrophe  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1520) now  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1521) the action of a has obviously limited  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1524) the alternatives but since there is  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1527) another person they still would consider  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1529) in marriage their actions are not  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1531) coerced  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1532) or in nazik's terminology not made  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1535) involuntary  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1537) eventually this concludes with zed and  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1540) zed apostrophe marrying  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1543) now zed and z apostrophe have no other  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1546) alternative other than to marry each  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1548) other but their marriage is still  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1551) voluntary  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1552) no coercion has taken place and nozick  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1555) says the fact that their only or other  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1558) alternative  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1560) is in their view much worse  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1562) and the fact that others chose to  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1565) exercise their rights in certain ways  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1568) thereby shaping the external environment  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1571) of options in which zed and z apostrophe  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1574) choose does not mean they did not marry  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1577) uh they did not marry voluntarily so  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1580) nozick basically maintained that since  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1582) other people have made decision based on  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1584) their right right  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1586) to choose whom they wish to marry and  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1589) there was no violation of anyone's  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1591) rights  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1592) zed and zed apostle free have not been  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1594) coerced and he continues and says  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1599) a through to why  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1601) each acted voluntarily and within their  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1604) rights a person's choice among differing  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1606) degrees of um  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1608) unpalatable alternatives is not rendered  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1611) non-voluntary by the fact that others  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1614) voluntarily chose and acted within their  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1617) rights in a way that did not provide him  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1619) with a more palatable alternative  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1622) basically just because you have an  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1624) alternative or you you even have only  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1626) one choice now you don't have many  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1627) choices you only have one choice and  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1629) that choice is not palatable it's it's  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1632) unreasonable you don't want to make that  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1634) choice or you didn't want to make that  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1635) choice but since now you have to make a  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1638) choice you've made a choice to marry  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1640) someone who you would not in a million  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1642) years marry but since you want to get  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1644) married and you only have one choice  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1645) then you're making that choice just  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1647) because you've made an unpalatable  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1649) choice based upon  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1651) limiting factors that have been somehow  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1653) imposed by other people's choices if  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1656) they haven't acted in a way that they  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1658) shouldn't have  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1658) have acted and they haven't infringed  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1661) upon your own rights and they've acted  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1663) in  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1664) you know within their own rights then  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1665) you're not  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1667) coerced  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1668) right you're still free  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1671) because they've acted  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1673) in accordance to their rights and they  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1675) haven't infringed upon your rights  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1677) yes it could be the case  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1679) that in in many scenarios you know you  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1682) may have a an an ideal choice but  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1685) because of  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1686) other people acting within their rights  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1688) and they haven't infringed upon your  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1690) rights you end up making a choice  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1692) and you have you have more limited  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1694) choices and you're making a choice that  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1696) is not your ideal choice  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1698) but that doesn't mean you're not free  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1700) as long as they haven't violated your  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1702) rights and as long as they haven't acted  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1704) in a way that is not within their right  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1706) and haven't acted in a way that is is  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1710) basically wrong or they have or they  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1712) they they act in a way that's within  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1714) their rights and they didn't act in  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1715) in a way that you know  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1719) was was an infringement upon your rights  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1721) and they had no right to act that way  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1723) right as long as they act in an  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1724) appropriate way  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1726) and within their rights and then  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1727) infringe upon your rights  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1729) then even if as a result of their  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1731) actions and what they've done you have  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1733) limited options and even just one option  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1735) that's unpalatable you're still free  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1737) you're not coerced  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1740) now the empirical account really  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1742) challenges the non-empirical account so  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1744) you have the political philosopher  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1746) serena osaretti she basically  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1750) disagreed with nausic and she argued for  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1752) an empirical conception of coercion so  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1754) what does she basically say  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1755) she says she postulated that when a  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1758) person has no other reasonable choice  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1760) their freedom is actually curtailed that  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1762) was her view  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1763) now we're going to understand that this  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1765) is incoherent  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1767) and in many cases impractical from a  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1768) social political perspective but what  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1771) what she's basically saying is that if  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1773) a person had no other reasonable choice  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1777) then they've been coerced  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1779) right their freedom is curtailed  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1782) so she makes a distinction she basically  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1784) says that  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1786) zed and zed apostrophe were free in  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1789) choosing to get married that is true so  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1790) they're not coerced in choosing to get  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1792) married however and this is very  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1795) important to understand she specifically  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1797) says that you have to understand the  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1799) specific choice  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1801) you have to understand whether zed  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1803) married z apostrophe free of coercion  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1807) that specific choice of zed marrying zed  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1809) apostle free  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1810) were they free of coercion when they  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1813) made the choice to marry each other so  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1815) she's talking about specific choices in  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1817) general yes zed and zed apostle 3 are  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1820) free in choosing to get married but the  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1823) particular choice that they made  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1825) were they free to make that choice or  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1828) were they coerced in making that choice  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1831) she she articulates that doubt is not  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1833) whether they married voluntarily rather  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1836) the doubt is whether they married that  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1838) particular partner that is  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1840) whether they voluntarily choose to marry  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1843) that particular partner that they  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1845) married  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1846) so also ritchie for example she slightly  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1849) changed nausic's thought experiment to  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1851) include that not getting married would  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1853) lead to unreasonable and negative  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1856) alternatives such as strong social  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1858) ostracism attached to being unmarried  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1861) and i think in the previous  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1863) uh statement i think you have to double  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1865) check i think she said not getting  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1867) married would result to death  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1869) right so say not getting married would  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1872) lead to unreasonable and negative  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1874) alternatives they had no choice to marry  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1877) to marry each other meaning zed had to  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1879) marry that apostrophe because if they  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1881) don't get married at all it would lead  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1882) to unreasonable negative alternatives  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1885) and the only option they have is to  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1887) marry each other because everyone else  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1888) has been married off and  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1891) the unreasonable negative alternatives  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1893) has forced them to marry each other  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1894) they've been coerced  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1897) and that's her counter argument to  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1898) nausic but we see how  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1901) how incoherent she is or or even from a  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1903) practical even philosophical perspective  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1905) when you start to understand alan  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1908) whiteheimer's argument right now  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1911) the political philosopher he wrote the  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1913) book coercion his name is alan  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1915) whiteheimer and according to  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1917) academics  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1918) this book basically solved the problem  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1920) of coercion it's actually a really good  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1922) book to read if you're interested in  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1924) political philosophy and these ideas i  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1926) suggest you read it so  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1928) a whiteheimer he basically argued  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1930) against the empirical account of  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1931) coercion and  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1933) he did that by stating that  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1935) the outcome of a choice proposal is  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1938) based on a particular context and what  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1939) he said was that what matters is not the  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1942) negative alternatives  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1944) and and we've echoed this before he said  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1945) what matters is whether or not  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1949) there is an infringement of one's rights  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1952) whether or not the proposal or the  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1954) choices being made or the limited  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1955) factors is an infringement of  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1958) someone's rights  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1960) so let me give you an example with  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1963) another full experiment and i've got  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1965) this written down here and this and one  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1967) of the examples include a patient that  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1969) has to undergo a life-saving operation  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1971) so  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1972) for example consider a patient that has  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1974) to go to that has to have a life-saving  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1976) operation  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1977) the medical staff propose that the  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1979) patient has to undergo surgery to ensure  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1982) the survival  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1983) in order for the surgery to happen the  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1985) patient has to sign a consent form  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1987) in this context the patient has no other  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1990) option other than to sign the form  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1992) otherwise they'll die  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1994) the consequences of not doing so would  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1996) lead to an untenable  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=1998) situation which is the demise  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2001) now under the empirical account the  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2003) patient is forced to sign right  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2006) because they have no other option that  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2008) is that is desirable right  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2012) so  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2013) the point here is so they have their  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2016) because yeah they have no other option  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2018) that's desirable and  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2019) the the the and to basically not sign it  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2024) would lead to an undesirable option  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2025) which is death  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2027) however when this scenario is considered  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2029) under the rights based approach the  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2031) problem is solved  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2032) even though the patient has no other  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2035) option than to sign the consent form he  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2038) still does so without coercion  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2041) because their rights have not been  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2043) violated their rights have not been  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2045) violated  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2046) now their rights would be violated if  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2048) the surgeon were to operate without  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2050) consent then that would be tantamount or  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2052) equivalent to assault or abuse  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2055) now this example many other examples  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2057) show even in real life you can think of  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2059) them yourself like even buying a house  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2061) you could when you think of them just  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2063) because you have an undesirable option  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2066) right and that undesirable option  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2068) actually  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2069) forces you in some way to take another  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2071) option that that you may not wanted to  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2074) take but you you want to take it because  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2076) the other alternative is actually  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2078) undesirable it doesn't mean you're not  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2080) free it doesn't mean you're being  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2081) coerced you would only be coerced if  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2084) your rights have been violated in some  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2087) way so this is very important to  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2089) understand so let's uh let's unpack this  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2092) with another example buying a house  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2094) imagine you know you're buying a house  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2096) and you live in a city and there are for  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2099) example 1 000 houses that  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2102) are to be sold  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2104) now  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2105) 999 people before you got in there  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2108) faster they saved money faster than you  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2111) and they basically bought  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2113) all of the desirable 999 houses and the  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2116) only one house left and that house is  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2119) not the desired choice that you wanted  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2120) to make in actual fact you wouldn't buy  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2122) that house at all but since you have to  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2124) live somewhere because if you can't in  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2126) in this social context say if you don't  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2128) buy a house you're going to be homeless  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2130) since  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2131) the alternative option being homeless is  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2134) is not desirable at all  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2136) and it has negative consequences then  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2139) you have to now  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2140) buy that house even though you don't  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2142) like that house and you would never have  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2144) bought that house anyway even you know  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2147) even if someone told you even if your  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2148) mother told you to buy that house right  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2150) you wouldn't do it because it's not a  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2151) nice house you don't like it it doesn't  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2153) fulfill your requirements but you need a  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2155) roof over your head if you don't buy a  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2156) house in this in the example here in  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2159) this social context you'd be homeless  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2162) so yes  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2163) it's an undesirable alternative being  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2165) homeless and therefore you have to  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2167) choose the undesirable choice of buying  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2170) the the house number one thousand which  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2172) wasn't a very nice house but that is a  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2174) better option than being homeless  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2176) now just because now the peop the 999  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2180) people who bought all the other houses  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2182) they've acted within their rights and  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2184) they haven't violated your rights  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2186) in this context even though you have no  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2188) other option right in some way you've  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2190) been forced to buy the house because you  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2192) don't want to be homeless in this  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2193) context  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2194) you're not coerced you still have  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2196) freedom because your rights have not  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2197) been violated  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2200) so what does it teach us brothers and  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2202) sisters that freedom is really about  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2203) rights  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2205) freedom  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2206) is about rights  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2208) so the question we could ask is well  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2210) what conception of rights but before we  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2212) get into that take into consideration  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2215) two distinct conception of rights the  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2216) negative and the positive so negative  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2218) understanding of rights basically is  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2220) that you don't impose any obligation on  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2223) others to provide you with anything  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2225) and the right to really just limited  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2228) they're based on  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2229) life liberty and property and this is  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2232) really echoes the libertarian approach  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2234) to rights they have a negative rights  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2236) understanding  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2238) another conception of rights is the  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2240) positive rights and what do they what  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2241) they say is that yes people should be  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2243) provided with certain things  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2245) now this implies that we have  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2247) obligations to each other and this is  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2248) the kind of socialist understanding if  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2250) you like now these obligations do not  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2252) involve  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2254) do not only involve not interfering with  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2255) other people people's rights but ensures  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2257) that one gets whatever has the rights to  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2260) so the society has to come together in a  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2262) social way in order to ensure that we  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2264) have uh our rights fulfilled okay and  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2267) that could include housing health care  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2269) and so on and so forth so that would be  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2271) the positive conception of rights  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2274) now  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2276) this leads to circular argument in what  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2278) way because if someone basically says  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2280) freedom is the absence of coercion which  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2282) is true the absence of coercion is when  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2285) rights are not being violated  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2287) therefore freedom is when rights are not  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2289) violated fair enough yeah we don't  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2291) necessarily disagree with this but the  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2293) point here is if they assume a negative  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2296) view of rights they're going to  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2297) basically say well the negative view of  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2299) rights is the correct view of rights  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2301) therefore preserving someone's negative  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2303) rights protects their freedom but that's  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2306) a secular argument  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2308) that's a circular argument on also known  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2311) uh circular reasoning also known in  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2313) latin as circulars in propandle right  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2315) it's a circular argument why because in  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2318) this case the libertarian that advocates  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2321) a negative human rights has presupposed  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2324) that these rights are true the negative  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2325) conception is true  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2327) this means that the premises of the  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2328) argument require as much justification  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2331) as the conclusion  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2333) because when they say that absence of  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2335) coercion is when rights are not being  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2337) violated  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2338) they are talking about a negative view  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2340) on rights but they have to actually  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2342) prove why those negative that negative  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2344) human rights is actually the correct  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2346) conception of rights  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2348) so whether you're a socialist or whether  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2351) you advocate a positive human rights or  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2353) negative human rights  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2354) you can't just assume  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2357) that if your negative rights have been  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2359) preserved and they haven't been violated  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2361) that you're actually free  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2363) because that  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2364) presupposes that the negative human  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2367) right actually correct but you have to  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2369) actually show that's the case  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2372) so  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2373) let's let's just break it down again so  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2375) libertarians for example they argue that  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2378) positive rights can tell freedom it's  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2381) against freedom because people are  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2383) obligated or imposed to to facilitate  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2386) there's an imposition on them to  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2387) facilitate other people's rights and  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2389) what they basically say is that the  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2390) negative view of rights is the correct  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2392) view on rights okay  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2394) so they would say  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2395) freedom is the absence of coercion  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2397) number one freedom is the absence of  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2398) coercion number two the absence of  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2400) coercion is when rights are not violated  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2403) and they're assuming here the negative  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2404) human rights  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2406) number three therefore freedom is when  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2407) rights are not violated  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2410) but here there are presupposing and  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2411) negative human rights so what they're  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2412) basically saying is for the negative  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2415) your rights then negative view is the  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2417) correct view of rights number five  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2419) therefore preserving someone's negative  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2421) rights protects their freedom  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2423) but these these these  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2425) this actually presupposes their negative  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2427) human rights which is a secular  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2429) reasoning what they have to do is to  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2430) show that the negative human rights is  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2432) actually the correct conception of  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2434) rights and you can apply the same uh  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2437) argument here to the positive human  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2439) rights to the socialists as well  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2442) so this is why this discussion so far  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2444) allows us to ask the following key  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2446) question  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2447) who has the correct conception of rights  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2450) is it those that advocate negative  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2452) rights like the libertarians or those  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2455) that call for positive rights like the  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2456) socialists or is the islamic conception  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2459) of rights correct  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2460) now obviously  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2462) so from from the perspective of today's  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2464) question  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2465) since coercion involves a violation of  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2468) rights  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2469) and therefore freedom if it's based on  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2471) coercion is basically the violation of  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2473) rights  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2475) then one's view of freedom would change  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2478) based on a different conception of  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2479) rights  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2480) now to answer the question does  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2483) you know does islam can tell freedom we  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2485) say no because islam has its own  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2487) conception of rights you have in our  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2489) tradition from the quran and the son of  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2490) the idea of  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2492) the rights of individuals the rights of  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2493) animals the rights of your neighbor the  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2495) rights of society the rights of allah  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2497) subhanahu wa ta'ala the rights of  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2499) animals right we have a detailed ethical  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2503) value-based tradition that's come from  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2504) an intellectual foundation that is true  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2506) and whatever comes from truth is true we  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2509) have a set of rights if those rights are  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2511) preserved and they're not being violated  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2513) then by definition you are free  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2516) so we would say no islam doesn't tell  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2518) freedom because islam has its own  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2520) conception of rights and the  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2522) understanding of freedom is based on  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2523) coercion and coercion is not just being  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2525) forced to do something or or or forced  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2528) to take an option that you didn't really  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2529) want to take it's more about that  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2530) someone hasn't acted in a way that they  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2533) had no right to act in that way and that  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2534) they basically didn't violate your  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2536) rights as long as your rights are not  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2538) violated then you're free by definition  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2541) oh but i i you know i islam doesn't  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2544) allow you to do this and islam doesn't  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2546) allow you to do that so but we don't  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2548) have a right to do that so our rights  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2549) haven't been violated  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2551) oh you're assuming a libertarian view of  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2554) rights i see  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2556) do you see now you've unpacked their  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2558) assumption so what that allows you to do  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2561) is to really bring it back to the  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2563) intellectual foundations of islam and  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2565) show how islam is true and we're going  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2566) to discuss in a few moments when we talk  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2568) about our context so just to summarize  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2570) you know the answer to this question  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2572) does islam could tell freedom no it  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2573) doesn't because according to the islamic  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2575) intellectual tradition you know god's  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2577) existence is a self of an evident truth  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2580) and it's a truth that can be infer that  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2582) can be affirmed through rational  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2583) investigation and allah grants us rights  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2586) and the quran is the miraculous text  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2588) book of  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2589) allah  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2590) and  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2591) the quran and the sunnah and the  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2593) prophetic traditions give us our rights  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2595) and that these rights have come from the  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2597) one who is maximally perfect he is  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2599) the source of all goodness allah says in  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2601) the quran he is the source of  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2603) all goodness in chapter 50 verse 28  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2606) allah has the picture we just got the  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2607) pixel he understands what's truly good  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2609) for us and he is perfectly fair and just  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2613) and allah has given us rights as long as  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2614) those rights are preserved and not been  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2616) violated then we are free because we  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2619) already discussed freedom is the absence  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2622) of coercion but what is coercion  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2623) coercion is not having limited factors  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2626) to the point that you only have one  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2627) choice or you have a choice that that  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2629) you have to make a choice that you  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2630) didn't really want to make no  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2632) it's about someone or an agency or  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2635) individual or a collective have acted in  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2638) a way that they shouldn't have acted  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2640) and that they had no right to act in  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2642) that way  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2643) or  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2645) they have basically infringed upon your  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2647) rights as long as they haven't infringed  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2649) upon your rights they haven't violated  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2651) your rights and as long as they have  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2652) acted in the way that they had a right  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2654) to act in that way then even if you have  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2657) one option that's and that you didn't  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2658) want to make originally and you're  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2660) you're almost forced to make that option  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2662) because the alternative is unpalatable  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2664) you're still free because your rights  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2666) haven't been violated  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2669) so since  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2670) it's about rights then we could ask the  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2672) question well what conception of rights  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2674) are true and we could say well since  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2675) islam has its own understanding of  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2677) rights yes there could be some  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2678) similarities with other traditions and  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2680) world views but generally speaking we  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2682) have our own understanding of rights and  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2684) our own priorities as well  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2686) then we should say because satan know  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2687) islam doesn't tell freedom you may  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2690) disagree with this because you may  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2691) disagree with the islamic conception of  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2693) rights and this is now  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2695) how you could articulate  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2697) a kind of  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2699) positive case for the islamic tradition  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2701) because you could use this question to  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2702) bring it to the essence of islam which  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2704) is the submission to allah  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2706) the submission of to god and you could  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2709) show to them the the intellectual  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2710) foundations of islam that they're true  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2712) and that's how we have to take  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2713) intellectual leadership and challenge  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2715) false assumptions we can't for example  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2718) assume a libertarian or socialist  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2720) conception of rights just to you know  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2722) make islam look good this is a huge  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2725) disservice to our tradition  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2727) and islam  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2728) doesn't need to be made to look good  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2730) islam is good because it comes from the  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2732) one who is the source of all good and  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2734) that's what we need to understand  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2736) so we need to obviously do it with  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2737) intelligence and with compassion you  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2739) know the prophet salallahu said in an  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2742) authentic hadith  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2744) narrated by bukhari  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2748) arabic is  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2750) for the people for humanity what you  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2751) love for yourself  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2753) so we have to and this means we have to  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2754) be committed to the goodness and  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2755) guidance of all people and this echoes  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2757) the teachings of the classical scholar  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2758) and now  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2759) and also of the maliki scholar even  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2762) the point here is we must be committed  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2764) to the goodness and guidance of all  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2765) people the well-being of all people and  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2768) in this context we need to articulate  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2770) this in a positive compassionate  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2772) intelligent way see no islam doesn't  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2774) control  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2775) freedom because freedom is an absence of  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2777) coercion and the absence of conversions  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2779) about the non-violation of your rights  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2780) even though you may have only one option  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2783) and it's unpalatable the point is just  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2786) because you have restricted choices as  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2787) long as your rights haven't been  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2788) violated then you're still free you're  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2790) not uncoerced therefore you're free  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2793) and islam has its own conception of  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2794) rights and since it preserves those  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2796) rights and it tries to protect those  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2798) rights and ensure those rights then by  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2800) definition islam does not curtail  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2802) freedom now obviously you're going to  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2803) say why i disagree with islamic  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2805) conception of rights no i'm like i  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2806) disagree with the libertarian conception  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2808) of rights  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2809) so how do we know which one is true will  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2811) go to the foundations i can show you  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2813) that god exists i can show you the quran  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2815) is from from the divine from god and  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2818) the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2820) is the final prophet and this is the  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2821) kind of intellectual basis of the  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2823) foundations if you like in which forms  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2826) the kind of grounding of foundations for  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2828) our rights and this foundation is true  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2830) and whatever comes from truth is true so  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2833) these rights are true because they've  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2834) come from this true intellectual  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2836) foundation so what now you you what  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2839) you're doing now is bringing people to  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2841) the intellectual foundations of summit  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2842) and into tawheed because you make them  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2844) realize that once you understand that  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2846) god exists in the quran is from allah  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2847) then then what does the quran and the  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2849) prophetic teachings teach us about allah  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2851) he is maximally perfect to the highest  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2853) degree possible his names and attributes  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2856) have no deficiency and no flaw  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2858) and one of his names is albar he is the  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2860) source of oh goodness and his goodness  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2862) is maximally perfect he is the just  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2865) he is the wise he is  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2867) and he has given us rights and therefore  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2870) by virtue of who allah is the rights  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2872) that he's given us are going to be the  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2873) correct view on rights and the the most  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2876) and the true view on rights that we must  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2878) have and as long as those rights are  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2879) preserved and those rights uh have been  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2882) protected and that they haven't been  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2884) violated then by definition as we've  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2887) just discussed in this seminar we are  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2889) free islam doesn't control freedom and  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2891) we know these rights are true because  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2893) they come from god and we could prove  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2894) god's existence and they come from the  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2896) quran we could prove the quran is from  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2898) god himself do you see how you could  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2900) link it in a dial context but that this  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2902) requires intellectual leadership and  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2903) some kind of intellectual bravery  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2905) because when you consider the social  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2906) psychological implication of this this  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2908) discussion when you're talking about  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2910) freedom sometimes psychologically you're  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2912) like yeah i agree with you yeah you know  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2915) you know  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2916) yeah it's my freedom to dress in a  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2918) particular way and it's and it's and i'm  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2921) free to to do this or to do that but in  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2924) some cases in the islamic tradition  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2925) actually allah hasn't given that right  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2927) to make that particular choice because  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2929) the essence of islam is the submission  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2930) to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2933) right so this is very important we can't  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2935) fall for the epistemological trap or the  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2937) metaphysical trap if you like don't you  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2940) fall into the epistemological and  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2942) metaphysical lizard hole we don't adopt  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2945) false assumptions you don't have to be a  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2948) libertarian just to make islam sound  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2950) good or socialist just to make islam  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2952) sound good allow islam to speak for  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2954) itself understand this in an  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2956) intellectual way and understand that  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2958) freedom is not just a libertarian uh  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2960) understanding of rights or a socialist  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2962) understanding of rights  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2964) it's about rights itself well what are  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2966) the correct conception of rights it's  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2968) not the libertarian it's not the  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2969) socialists it's obviously the islamic  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2971) why because islam came from the one  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2975) who knows everything allah it came from  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2977) allah subhanahu wa ta'ala who's a  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2979) maximally perfect being that created us  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2980) and that has more affection for us than  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2982) our own mothers and he's a source of oh  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2984) goodness  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2984) and he  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2986) he he sent down the revelation the quran  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2988) which is true and we could prove to be  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2990) true and he sent down the prophet sallam  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2992) and we know he is the final prophet for  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2993) so many reasons and these things gave us  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2996) our rights and this is a  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=2999) an intellectual foundation that is true  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3001) and what comes from truth is true this  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3003) is what we should be talking about to  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3005) liberate humanity and even from a  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3007) practical perspective when people  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3008) appreciate that islamic conception of  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3010) rights are the true conception of rights  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3012) as long as they're preserved and they're  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3014) not violated then not only  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3016) intellectually they could understand  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3018) that they're free but they will actually  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3020) fill that freedom they'll feel that  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3021) liberation they'll taste the sweetness  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3024) of islam  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3025) this is what we need to do take this  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3027) type of leadership don't fall for the  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3030) kind of epistemological metaphysical  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3032) trap  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3033) you have to adopt their false  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3034) assumptions oh you remember what we said  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3037) it's a circular argument yes freedom is  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3039) the absence of coercion the absence of  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3041) coercion is a non-violation of rights  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3043) right  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3045) and therefore  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3046) as long as your rights are not violated  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3048) then you're free  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3050) but the libertarian would make the  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3052) argument but assume a libertarian  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3054) conception of rights  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3056) which is basically a circular argument  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3058) right  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3059) because they have to justify the  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3060) premises as well as the conclusion so  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3062) the point here is don't adopt that false  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3064) presupposition say no hold on a second  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3066) we don't have a libertarian view we have  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3068) an islamic view what does the exam of  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3070) you actually say  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3071) and how can we show to people that that  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3073) view is the correct view you have to  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3075) assume that allah exists that he's  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3076) worthy of worship that the quran is from  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3078) allah the prophet is the final prophet  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3080) teach them about who allah is his  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3082) maximum perfection and in his perfect  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3084) wisdom he's given us this these these  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3086) these these rights and as long as  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3088) they're preserved and not violated then  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3089) we're truly free and yes from a newt's  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3092) perspective a lot of the rights that  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3093) islam talks about  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3095) you know are shared with other world  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3097) views but there's many distinctions and  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3100) clear distinctions and even the way we  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3102) prioritize those rights as well so  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3104) that's why it's very important to  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3105) understand it from this perspective  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3106) brothers and sisters  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3109) so here's the bibliography for you uh  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3111) alan whitehammer white whiteheimer uh  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3114) his book called coercion robert nozick  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3116) his famous book anarchy state in utopia  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3119) serena alsaretti her book liberty  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3121) uh desert and um the the market  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3125) uh and so on and so forth uh these  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3127) slides should be available for you in  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3129) the near future insha allah  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3131) so  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3133) any questions  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3134) brothers and  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3136) sisters  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3138) any questions  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3142) so let's take some questions  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3149) let's take some questions now so  
[0:52:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3153) go back to the foundation  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3155) [Music]  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3158) okay so you're saying wouldn't that be a  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3160) circular argument too  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3162) uh wouldn't that be a second argument  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3164) too are you saying you can't prove  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3165) rights logically no no we're not saying  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3167) that what we're saying is  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3169) if someone's a libertarian or a  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3170) socialist or they have a particular  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3172) conception of rights  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3173) if they basically say well freedom is  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3175) the absence of coercion the absence of  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3178) coercion is when your rights have not  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3179) been violated therefore  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3182) freedom is when your rights have not  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3184) been violated that's true however the  
[0:53:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3187) libertarian will push that argument  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3189) to actually prove a libertarian  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3191) conception of rights because what rights  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3193) are they talking about  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3194) in order in order for it not to be a  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3196) secular argument they have to show why  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3198) the libertarian human rights are  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3199) actually true  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3201) so yes islam has a conception of rights  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3203) we can't just use that argument a basic  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3205) way we have to actually show why the  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3207) islamic conception of rights are true  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3208) and that enables us to link it to tawhi  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3210) to link it to the foundations to link it  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3212) to allah  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3214) to to actually call people to islam use  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3217) this question to call people to islam  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3219) which is the work of the anbiya the work  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3221) of the prophets and what we should be  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3222) doing in our discussions even of this  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3224) nature even when it sounds political or  
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3226) ideological or whatever the case may be  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3228) use it as a need to bring them to the  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3230) foundations to bring them to the fact  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3232) that they need to submit themselves to  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3233) allah and worship allah  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3235) and you could do it in this discussion  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3237) so yeah no it's not a circular argument  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3239) as long as you  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3241) show that your conception of rights are  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3243) actually true and we can do that in the  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3245) islamic context  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3252) okay so  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3253) let's take more questions  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3264) any questions any other questions  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3266) brothers and sisters  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3272) i'm just waiting for some questions  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3278) okay  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3282) does the fact let's put this up  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3286) does the fact that if you don't follow  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3289) other than islam you go to hell  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3293) a coercion  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3294) just  
[0:54:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3295) in the example of zed  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3298) and zed apostrophe does the fact that if  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3301) you don't follow other than islam you go  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3303) to her coercion  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3305) okay so if you remember the example zed  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3307) marrying zed apostrophe they were not  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3310) coerced  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3311) yes they may have had no other  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3312) reasonable alternative because they  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3314) wanted to get married and they had no  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3316) other choice other than to marry each  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3318) other  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3318) but as long as the other  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3321) as long as  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3323) an agency on individuals they acted  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3325) within their rights and zed and zed  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3327) possibilities rights have not been  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3328) violated then they are not they are not  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3332) coerced they still uncoes they're still  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3334) free  
[0:55:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3335) and that's the point here so i think  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3336) you've got the question mistaken  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3338) so if you're saying that just because  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3341) you know allah says that if you don't  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3342) follow islam if you don't worship allah  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3344) subhanahu wa allah then the spiritual  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3347) consequences that you're going to hell  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3349) you are you saying that's a form of  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3350) coercion no because your rights have not  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3352) been violated what rights have been  
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3354) violated here  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3355) do you see my point  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3357) so  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3358) in the context of our discussion there's  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3360) more to say about this and i really  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3361) recommend that you listen to abdullah  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3363) and lucy's uh clip on the whole notion  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3366) of  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3367) uh hell and if it's just or not  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3371) i saw it on sabor ahmed's youtube  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3374) channel there is a clip there's a very  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3376) powerful articulation  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3377) and i think bassam zawadi has written a  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3380) piece i haven't read it so i can't  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3381) advocate but i trust him and he's  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3383) written some really good pieces  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3384) especially on days and uh give give that  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3387) piece a read you can find on his  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3388) academic.edu profile he's writing a  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3391) piece on that i don't want to unpack  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3392) this now because your question is in the  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3394) context of the example so hopefully i've  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3395) clarified it from that perspective  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3400) okay so  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3411) it's bear with me  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3413) any other questions  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3417) [Music]  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3420) yeah  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3421) absolutely so  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3423) the question here is so this in a  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3425) nutshell proved to prove that islamic  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3428) rights is the true conception because  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3430) there is no coercion okay  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3432) i think the way i think maybe uh the  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3434) question could have been articulated a  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3436) little bit better but what i think what  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3437) you're trying to say is in a nutshell as  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3439) long as you can prove that islam has its  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3441) own conception of rights  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3443) and those conception of rights are true  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3445) and if they're preserved and not  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3446) violated  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3447) then therefore  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3449) you're free from this philosophical idea  
[0:57:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3451) of freedom absolutely absolutely that's  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3453) all you need to do and if you do it  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3456) without falling for a libertarian view  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3458) or socialist view and jumping into you  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3460) know false ideologies  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3462) if you do it correctly that would be an  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3464) amazing opportunity to call them to  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3465) allah that he is worthy of worship that  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3468) he must submit to him and and that you  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3470) should believe in allah and his  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3471) messenger and you believe in in his  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3473) books you believe in the quran because  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3475) in improving the rights  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3477) the islamic conception of rights you  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3479) have to show in certain contexts and  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3481) many contexts that allah exists that is  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3483) worthy of worship but the person is the  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3484) final prophet and that the quran is  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3486) actually a divine miraculous book  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3492) [Music]  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3497) any other questions brothers and sisters  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3502) sorry for it being quite heavy by the  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3504) way if you want to um obviously you  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3506) could revisit and re re-watch this  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3508) seminar it's going to be up online  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3511) but also there is an essay on the  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3513) sapience institute website if you go to  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3516) writings and you go to art articles  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3518) essays and articles i think it's the the  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3520) last one if you scroll down  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3522) it's called  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3524) um  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3525) does islam keto freedom it's the same  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3527) title i think i wrote that i wrote the  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3529) piece it was originally taken from my  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3531) postgraduate essay alhamdulillah a  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3534) distinction for it um and i wanted to  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3536) tailor it in our context  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3539) and i think and we don't really talk  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3541) about this  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3543) the idea of philosophical idea of  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3544) freedom usually we talk about political  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3546) conceptions like libertarianism and  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3548) socialism all that stuff or even from an  
[0:59:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3550) excessive ideological point of view but  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3551) i think this is a very powerful approach  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3553) if done properly obviously with the  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3555) right people  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3557) it could be quite a powerful powerful  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3559) perspective insha allah  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3567) okay so  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3569) any other questions  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3575) i'll put this up because it's quite  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3576) funny just want to say hamza being  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3578) follow you following you since 2017 not  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3581) physically don't worry  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3582) my love bless you bro  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3584) may allah make you follow much better  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3586) people than me they're much more worthy  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3588) to follow as well of course  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3589) which is quite obvious  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3591) and you know  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3592) anything good that i do has come from  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3594) allah and any bad that i do has come  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3596) from my ego in shaytan and please you  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3599) know overlook and forgive me my thoughts  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3601) and take me to account and correct us  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3603) and help us improve  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3605) um  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3605) [Music]  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3607) okay so  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3615) where where are we where are we so well  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3618) if it is true because it comes wrong  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3624) okay this good question  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3626) so he says well if the islamic if  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3628) islamic conception of rights is true  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3629) because it comes from a true from true  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3631) argument then i would say it's a genetic  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3633) fallacy any proposition that comes from  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3635) true doesn't necessarily mean it's true  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3639) yes  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3639) but let's now focus about even without  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3642) thinking a question properly let's just  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3644) say you're right this is irrelevant to  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3646) the argument because what we're saying  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3647) here is  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3648) what is this true foundation these  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3650) rights have come from allah subhanahu wa  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3652) to allah what is the nature of allah he  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3654) is maximally perfect his names and  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3656) attributes are to the highest degree  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3657) possible so  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3659) his he is al-hakim so his wisdom is to  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3662) the highest degree possible it has no  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3664) deficiency and no flow his knowledge  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3666) he's  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3667) the knowing he has the totality of  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3669) knowledge allah has the picture we have  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3671) a pixel allah is  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3673) he is the source of a goodness so when  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3675) you understand who allah is not only  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3677) could you prove allah is true meaning  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3679) that he exists but you can show this is  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3682) who allah is by proving the quran then  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3685) any rights allah has given you are going  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3687) to be true by definition not just  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3689) because of of of you know the source  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3692) happens to be true but because of who  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3695) allah is  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3696) right  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3698) allah is a maximally perfect being so a  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3700) maximally perfect being that is a source  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3702) of a goodness that knows all knowledge  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3704) all moral knowledge if you like has all  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3705) full wisdom has the picture we just got  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3708) the pixel when this being gives you  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3711) something that tells you something  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3713) then by virtue of that it's going to be  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3715) correct and true  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3717) so  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3718) don't straw man the argument it's  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3720) important to understand that when we say  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3722) the intellect the intellectual  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3723) foundations of islam are true what are  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3725) we really saying we're saying that god  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3726) exists the quran is true and the prophet  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3728) is true but what does that truth mean it  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3730) means that  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3732) it's divine revelation what does divine  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3734) revelation mean it means it's come from  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3736) the one who is maximally perfect who has  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3739) full knowledge full of wisdom is a  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3740) source of oh goodness  
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3741) and when  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3743) this divine revelation in the form of  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3744) the quran and the statements of the  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3746) prophet sallallahu alaihi if someone  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3747) give you rights  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3749) then they're going to be true  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3751) so it's not as simple as what you just  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3752) said may allah bless you exactly  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3757) any other questions brothers and sisters  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3770) all right we'll just leave it at that  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3771) then may allah bless every single one of  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3773) you i hope you you have benefited uh  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3775) anything good has come from allah  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3777) subhana wa to allah anything that is  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/71jEgL9tR1g?t=3779) wrongly inaccurate has come from
