### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=3600)

 discusses the idea of proper basic Islamic belief, which is that the heart is central to understanding true knowledge. It also suggests that the potency of the "fitrah" (the original nature of humans) makes it possible for humans to think intelligently and believe in the creator.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=0)** The purpose of this webinar is to discuss reformed epistemology, which is the idea that religious belief can be rational even without arguments. The presenter will try to frame this in a unique Islamic way and then look at concepts such as knowledge, justification, and belief. They will also discuss how the idea of fitla can relate to Islamic belief and how to extend the model for Islamic belief.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=300)** The presenter argues that belief in god is justified by means of good arguments, but that this is not always the case. He suggests that the belief is justified in a similar way that we are justified in believing in the external world.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=600)** Ibn Taymiyya believes that beliefs about the external world are justified by arguments, but that belief in the past is not justified by arguments. He argues that it is obvious that we were not created just five minutes ago and that it is doubtful that we could prove this by way of a non-circular argument.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=900)** Reformed epistemology is the idea that religious belief can be rational and justified without relying on good arguments. To convincingly argue this, the theory requires a toolkit of concepts, including justification and warrant. In this webinar, Andrew Moon explains the basics of reformed epistemology and its implications for the rationality of belief in God.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=1200)* Discusses how to properly understand Islamic belief and how it relates to epistemology. Ibn Taymiyya and Reformed Epistemology discusses concepts like justification, truth, and knowledge. It states that a true belief is sufficient for knowledge.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=1500)* Discusses the idea of justification, which is the justification of a belief based on evidence. Ibn Taymiyya and Reformed Epistemology argue that mere belief is not sufficient for knowledge, and that justification is needed for knowledge. Ibn Taymiyya points to a case of knowledge where a person had sensory percepts (seeing a tree outside, hearing rain, etc.), as well as a strong seeming, and had justification for their belief.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=1800)* Discusses the problem of knowledge, which is that it is difficult to know whether one has justified true belief. It goes on to discuss the concept of knowledge, which is different than justified true belief.  then provides an example of a situation in which someone has justification for a belief, but does not know that the belief is true.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=2100)** The first condition for warrant is that the belief being warranted be based on proper functioning of a cognitive faculty. This is relevant to knowledge because when a cognitive faculty is functioning properly, it produces the belief that is warranted. The second condition for warrant is that the belief be based on access to reasons. When reason is accessible, the belief is warranted. The third condition for warrant is that the belief be based on a design plan that the faculty should follow. When a faculty is functioning according to its design plan, the belief is warranted. The fourth condition for warrant is that the belief be based on intuitive judgment. Intuitive judgments are based on faculties functioning properly, and when faculties are functioning properly, the belief is warranted. This thesis of warrant being based on proper function has four conditions, and the belief in God can meet all four conditions.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=2400)** This 1-paragraph summary of the video discusses how Ibn Taymiyya believed that proper function of cognitive faculties is necessary for knowledge, and that failure to meet these conditions results in faulty beliefs.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=2700)** This webinar discusses the Islamic belief that a basic belief is something that comes to a person immediately without argument or inference. It also discusses the idea of properly basic beliefs, or beliefs that are warranted by the faculties that the person uses to hold them.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=3000)* Discusses the idea that human beings have faculties for knowing things, and that proper function of these faculties can lead to the formation of beliefs that are properly basic. Ibn Taymiyya proposes a model of reform of history which shows how theism (belief in god) can be properly basic, and that it can be justified along the lines of proper function.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=3300)** Ibn Taymiyya discusses the idea of proper basic Islamic belief, which is that the heart is central to understanding true knowledge. He also suggests that the potency of the "fitrah" (the original nature of humans) makes it possible for humans to think intelligently and believe in the creator.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=3600) - [01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=5400)

This webinar discusses Ibn Taymiyya's view that proper belief in God is based on proper faculties functioning properly. It is argued that atheism is not logically sound, and that science can influence belief in God.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=3600)** The belief that one has in God is a belief that is immediately produced when one's heart is in a cognitive state that believes in God. This belief is properly basic as long as theFifa (the cognitive system that allows one to apprehend signs pointing to the existence of God) is functioning properly.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=3900)** The presenter summarizes the five points of the standard model of Islamic belief, which includes the belief that Allah exists and created humans, the belief that revelation is from Allah, that these revelatory signs lead to basic belief in Islam, and that this belief is sufficient for knowledge. He then discusses how this model can be extended to Islam specifically, mentioning that upon apprehension of revelatory signs, humans can acquire basic belief in the truth of Allah's revelation and religion.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=4200)** argues that belief in Islam can be properly basic without needing to presuppose arguments or evidence, and that in the absence of any defeater, we are justified in suspecting our belief is fully warranted.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=4500)* Discusses the problem of religious diversity and how it can be overcome using the equal weight principle. He argues that this principle is self-defeated because it leads to the dismissal of our epistemic peers. He suggests possible solutions to this problem.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=4800)** explains that proper functionalism holds that belief is warranted only if it is produced by faculties that are properly functioning. He then goes on to argue that atheism is not logically sound as an intellectual position, but that there is another way to put it. He argues that there just doesn't seem to be a naturalistic atheistic account of the conditions for proper functionalism.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=5100)** The presenter discusses the concept of properly basic beliefs, which can be justified without argument. He goes on to discuss how belief in god can be warranted based on fine tuning and the beginning of the universe. Finally, he suggests that science can influence belief in god.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y8idsg5j4&t=5400)** In this webinar, Ibn Taymiyya and Reformed epistemology are discussed. Ibn Taymiyya argues that proper belief is based on proper faculties functioning properly. If one has no reason to suspect that the belief is not basic, then they are justified in their belief. My essay will be available soon on the website to clear up any confusion.

[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=64) belief  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=65) in tamiya and reformed epistemology  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=68) so it's it might be the case that for  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=71) many of you or at least for some of you  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=74) some of these terms and that you're  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=76) going to come across  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=77) uh you may not be familiar with it may  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=79) be the first time that you're  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=81) you know hearing these terms and so i'm  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=84) going to do my best insha allah to try  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=86) and define them for you  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=88) and to make everything clear for  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=90) instance properly basic belief or  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=92) reformed epistemology  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=94) on this the title here might not be  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=97) something familiar but uh being building  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=99) that by god's permission  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=101) at the end of the session in chat online  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=103) will be it will be  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=105) clear okay so well let's get into  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=108) inshallah  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=109) um so we'll just  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=112) give an outline as to what we intend to  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=115) cover and get  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=116) and get through in this uh in this  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=118) session so the  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=120) the general thesis or theme of the  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=123) webinar  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=124) is going to be looking at something  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=126) called reformed epistemology  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=128) now in one of the slides i'm going to go  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=129) through that in more depth  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=131) but just as um you know just to get you  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=134) familiar with it  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=135) performed epistemology is basically the  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=137) thesis or the idea  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=139) that religious belief can be rational  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=143) um even without arguments so that's  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=146) the general theme of this discussion and  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=148) we're going to try and frame this in a  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=150) unique islamic way inshallah  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=153) and so we're from the epistemology in  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=155) the evidential subjection so we're going  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=157) to  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=157) try to define formal epistemology  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=160) understand the thesis  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=161) and also understand um what it's coming  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=164) up against what is it responding to  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=166) why is it a position that philosophers  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=169) of religion have taken  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=170) and so yeah inshallah and then we're  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=173) going to look at some  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=175) concepts um such as knowledge and  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=178) justification and belief  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=180) and to try and help us flesh out this  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=183) idea  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=184) that belief in god or even in islam  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=187) there can be something sufficient for  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=190) knowledge it can be justified  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=193) even in the absence of arguments so in  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=195) order to build a strong thesis on this  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=198) point  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=198) obviously we need to get familiar with  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=200) some um  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=202) concepts and terms that will allow us to  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=204) do that in an academic way  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=207) and so we're going to look at the idea  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=209) of knowledge and what  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=210) sort of conditions that someone might  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=212) need  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=213) in order for their beliefs to have it  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=217) also we're going to look at a particular  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=219) concept  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=220) called warrant and this is linked to the  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=223) idea of  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=224) our faculties uh our faculty that aim at  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=227) um  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=228) giving us beliefs like our perceptual  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=231) faculties hearing sight and so on and  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=233) reason um and that's a lot to do with  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=236) them functioning  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=238) properly as they ought to it's going to  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=240) be integral to  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=242) what we're going to talk about in  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=244) relation to knowledge  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=245) and um as i said we're going to try and  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=248) develop this in  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=249) some unique islamic way um and we're  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=252) going to be drawing on the ideas of the  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=254) um damascene 14th century theologian  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=261) and we're going to offer a model based  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=263) on some of his ideas  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=265) um principally the idea of fitla and  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=269) we're going to look at how this can  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=272) relate  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=272) to belief in god as being  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=276) something that's uh let's say justified  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=278) without arguments  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=280) and then we're going to try and look at  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=281) extending that model  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=283) for specifically islamic belief  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=287) um as well and then we might discuss  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=289) some potential problems what are some of  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=290) the problems with this  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=292) thesis or this model that we've offered  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=293) or offering and what are the  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=296) what are some you know solutions to  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=298) those problems  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=300) and um finally we'll try to take your  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=303) questions  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=304) uh in so yeah uh  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=307) let's let's get into the actual session  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=309) now  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=310) so we begin with this idea of an  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=312) evidentialist objection to this  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=315) so this is an objection  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=318) to um belief in god uh  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=321) okay so let me try to paint a picture  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=324) for you to understand where we're coming  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=325) from  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=326) um and we're looking at the idea of  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=330) burden of proof here now many of you  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=332) have probably  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=333) had discussions with uh atheists or  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=336) people who don't believe in god  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=338) and um they will they'll often suggest  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=341) that the  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=342) the burden of proof uh in regards to  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=344) that belief  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=345) rests solely on the the shoulders of the  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=348) believing god  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=350) it's up to them to to um back up their  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=353) claim so to speak  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=354) they are the ones who need to give us uh  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=357) some arguments  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=358) uh you know in order for for us to um  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=363) wants to be warranted i'm just saying  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=365) there is no audio  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=366) in in one of the questions so just to  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=369) double check once again  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=370) um then everybody can hear me child  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=373) while you can just  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=374) verify so  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=377) um yeah alrighty so  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=380) often atheists will suggest you know  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=382) believes in god that they have a burden  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=383) of proof they need to  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=384) um you know demonstrate to to uh  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=387) uh to non-believers why why we should  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=389) believe in god  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=391) and um they they run an argument  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=394) maybe not uh as sophisticated as this  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=397) one but  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=398) uh you know your average atheist runs an  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=400) argument that  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=401) draws on an intuition a little bit like  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=404) like this so um they'll say something  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=407) like  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=408) belief in god uh you know it's justified  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=412) or warranted we're going to look at the  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=414) term warranted  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=415) um in more detail uh  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=418) in one of the sites they'll say you know  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=420) believe in god is justified or warranted  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=422) only by way of good argument  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=424) and then they'll say but there is no  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=426) good argument for belief in god  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=429) and therefore belief in god is not  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=431) justified or warranted  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=433) so this is the you know standard  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=436) objection  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=437) to theists who um you know don't offer  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=440) an argument or don't put some evidence  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=442) on the table so to speak  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=444) um you know the atheist will um will lay  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=447) something down  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=448) probably similar to this and this is  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=450) called the evidentialist objection to  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=451) theism  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=452) there's a traditional way in which um  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=455) people will go about in responding to it  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=458) and i'll just mention that  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=459) in a moment but um we're not going to  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=461) take that traditional approach so we're  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=463) going to take a different approach from  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=464) child land that's the um  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=466) the the novelty of reformed epistemology  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=469) as a concept  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=470) remember the idea that religious belief  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=473) can be rational without arguments  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=475) but why think that why why why think  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=479) that this is the case  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=480) um why think that belief in god is  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=482) justified only by way of good arguments  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=485) um you know is that sounds  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=488) plausible maybe at face value but is it  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=491) something that we should necessarily  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=492) accept  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=494) i i doubt it now  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=497) it seems to me that there are a number  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=499) of different beliefs that we  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=501) hold and we're very much rational in  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=504) holding them uh we're justified in doing  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=507) that  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=507) and we don't have very good arguments  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=510) um for these beliefs and in fact even if  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=513) we  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=514) did have good arguments most of us if  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=517) not all of us  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=518) um don't hold that belief in question  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=521) on the basis of those arguments even if  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=523) they exist  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=524) and for the most part i don't think that  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=526) they do at least not in a conclusive  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=528) sense  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=529) so consider belief in the external world  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=532) we believe that there is a world out  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=533) there before  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=534) this world is is real in the objective  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=536) sense this is not just a figment of our  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=538) imagination this is not a dream  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=540) and that's a belief that we hold as firm  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=543) as any other  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=544) and and yet you know philosophers like  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=547) to speculate  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=548) and they like to imagine well um here's  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=551) my  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=551) my handy animation so they like to  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=554) imagine well  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=555) isn't it logically possible that you  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=557) know you are a brain  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=559) in a jar and there's some alien like  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=561) species  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=562) you know putting probes into it and then  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=564) it's sort of projecting this  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=566) dreamlike world in the figment of the  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=569) imagination of this brain which is  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=570) ultimately you and so this is what this  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=573) world is  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=573) this is what this world is now of course  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=575) for most of us  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=576) you know this is obvious as you know  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=579) when our uh  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=580) as long as we're in sound mind of sound  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=582) mind it's pretty clear to us  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=584) that obviously the world is real out  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=586) there this isn't just a dream  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=588) and this isn't just a figment of our  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=590) imagination  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=592) but do we dismiss  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=595) this logical possibility by way of  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=598) arguments or do we  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=601) defend the belief in the external world  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=602) by way of arguments  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=604) well it just doesn't seem to me that we  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=607) do  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=608) and could we could we do so well you see  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=611) it seems that any argument that we we  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=614) offer  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=615) any reason that's accessible to our own  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=618) consciousness that we think about that  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=619) we construct  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=620) and that we offer it seems that we're  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=622) already assuming in some sense  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=625) that you know the world is real as we  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=627) see it um you know in order to  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=629) to construct an argument and so on you  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=631) have to think well  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=632) yeah that this is something possible  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=634) this is something that i can do  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=636) because the world is real my argument uh  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=638) released something objective  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=640) and um and so on so it seems to me that  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=644) you know we can't really escape the  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=646) problem by way of argument  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=647) but but that's not not not something to  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=649) worry about and  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=650) and it's not a belief that we um we hold  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=653) by the way by way of arguments i believe  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=654) we hold  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=655) intuitively and yet we all would you  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=658) know  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=659) defend it um you know  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=662) until the cows come home as as we say  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=664) here in  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=665) england um you know without  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=669) needing arguments that's one example and  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=672) this belief we would say is rational  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=674) what about belief in other minds that is  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=675) to say what about belief in other  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=677) persons  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=678) we believe that there are other persons  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=680) out there in the world around us  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=682) we see plenty of people walking out on  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=684) the streets going to school going  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=686) shopping and we see all these different  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=688) bodies walking  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=689) amongst us um do we do we think that  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=692) they are just  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=693) mere sort of robotic machines that don't  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=696) have  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=697) conscious mental states like we do  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=700) states like you know um i  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=702) feel this and i think that or they think  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=705) about something or they  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=706) reflect um you know well you think they  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=710) obviously have these  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=711) mental conscious states just like i do  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=713) just like you do  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=715) um but do i do i hold that belief  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=719) by way of argument do i argue um you  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=722) know from something of well  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=723) you know they look quite similar to me  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=725) they behave and react in a similar to it  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=727) a similar way to me  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=729) and therefore they probably are similar  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=731) to me in the sense that they have  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=732) conscious mental states therefore they  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=733) they're similar to me in that sense no  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=736) we don't construct arguments like that  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=737) it's  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=738) obvious you know when we're born we  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=739) don't we don't question um  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=742) the conscious mental state of our mother  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=744) it's very obvious that they are a  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=746) person that's conscious like us so  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=749) again this belief seems to be entirely  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=751) justified and rational for us  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=753) and even in the absence of arguments we  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=755) really we believe it  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=756) intuitively and it just seems to me that  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=758) the arguments  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=759) for it are just not strong anyway so  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=762) even if we have arguments  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=763) they don't they don't seem to do very  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=765) much by by way of um  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=767) proving it um conclusively  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=770) so that's the first point  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=775) now belief in the past  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=778) what about belief in the past again some  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=780) people might say well couldn't we have  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=782) been  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=782) you know created five minutes ago  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=785) with um memories that were implanted  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=789) within us um you know  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=792) memories of past events which didn't  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=794) really occur  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=795) um you know it's not logically possible  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=798) but of course we don't we don't  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=800) suspect that's the case we know it's  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=802) pretty obvious  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=803) that we weren't created just five  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=805) minutes ago and could we  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=807) could we prove this by way of arguments  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=809) well it's it's  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=810) doubtful that we could prove it by way  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=812) of a non-circular argument because  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=815) when i think about the memories that i  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=817) have  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=819) um obviously i'm using the the you know  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=822) my memory to form the belief about them  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=824) so if i want to demonstrate that i have  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=826) these memories that really happened  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=828) you know it seems like i can't do  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=829) anything but use and assume  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=832) the truthfulness of the the thing in  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=834) question  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=835) namely you know my memory corresponding  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=838) to real things  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=839) that happened so again it seems we have  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=842) this belief intuitively it seems to be  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=843) rational justified for us  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=845) and yet we don't have arguments  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=848) for it or we don't believe this by way  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=851) of arguments  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=853) so what about the reliability of our  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=856) faculties  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=857) well what i mean is you know we have  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=859) faculties for cognition  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=861) faculties for thought and reason and  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=863) forming beliefs  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=864) um we assume in some sense that these  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=866) faculties are not fallacious they're not  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=868) just  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=869) um making constant errors that they're  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=871) actually getting as  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=873) some sort of truth um out there in the  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=875) world you know  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=876) they're aimed at true belief when i form  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=878) the belief that there is this  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=879) laptop screen in front of me um you know  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=882) if i thought my faculties were  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=884) fallacious  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=885) then then i couldn't trust that belief  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=887) but obviously  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=889) we don't think like that and even if i  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=891) wanted to foremost  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=892) perform my doubt or my skeptical  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=895) argument  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=896) i have to rely on those faculties and i  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=898) have to think that all those faculties  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=899) are capable  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=900) in some sense of forming an argument  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=903) that's  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=903) reliable plausible uh something along  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=906) those lines  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=908) so what about our belief in god then  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=911) remember  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=912) the evidentialist he thinks that um you  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=915) know belief in god is is  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=917) is something that needs to be  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=919) demonstrated by way of arguments  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=920) but we've seen like at least a few  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=922) beliefs  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=924) which are perfectly rational which we  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=926) can hold justifiably  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=928) and yet we don't have arguments  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=930) necessarily for those so we don't  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=931) believe them by way of arguments  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=933) so why would our believing god be so  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=935) different why is it not immune  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=937) from this same requirement what sort of  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=940) suspicious or suspects about that belief  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=943) that it couldn't be um held rationally  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=946) without um needing arguments  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=951) so here comes reformed epistemology and  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=954) this is the novelty of it  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=957) first of all the novelty is of course um  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=961) rejecting the traditional approach when  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=964) i say rejecting it doesn't reject it  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=966) um it allows it but it's not the  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=969) approach  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=969) that it takes what i mean here is that  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=972) if you remember our evidentialist  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=974) objection  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=975) said that belief in god is justified if  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=977) and only if  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=978) you know there are good arguments um but  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=981) there are no good arguments therefore  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=982) that belief isn't justified  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=984) now um the traditional  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=988) theological approach would be to accept  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=991) the basic principle underlying this  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=994) argument but rejected by way of offering  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=998) arguments  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=999) so they would say well yeah okay premise  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1001) one that's  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1002) fine but premise two you know we reject  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1005) that because there are good arguments  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1007) for god's existence and therefore we are  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1008) justified  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1010) where you're not so that's the sort of  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1011) traditional theological approach  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1013) um which within western theological  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1016) philosophical history  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1018) is referred to as natural theology sort  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1020) of the way  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1021) a way of um demonstrating god's  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1024) existence  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1024) in reference to things in the world  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1026) rather than  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1028) in reference to scripture in in the  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1030) islamic tradition we find this very much  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1032) taken up by the discipline of reinman  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1036) so yeah but the reform that this  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1038) semologist  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1039) um takes a different approach the  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1041) reformed approach is  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1043) to reject premise one  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1047) um i'm aware of the term epistemology by  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1050) the way not being familiar to some of  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1051) you so  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1052) far but that's okay again the basic  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1055) thesis is just about  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1056) um belief in god or religious belief  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1058) being rational without arguments i will  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1060) try and define epistemology  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1062) in another slide perhaps the next one  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1063) around let's see um  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1066) so the reformed approach is to say  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1069) this argument falls down not simply  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1072) because we have good arguments  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1074) because even if we didn't have arguments  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1077) that's not a problem it rejects premise  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1079) one namely the idea that uh  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1082) belief in god is justified if and only  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1085) if  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1086) there are good arguments so this is the  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1089) approach  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1090) that we're going to take now uh or we're  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1092) going to try and build that  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1094) thesis um andrew moon  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1097) in his paper recent work in reformed  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1099) epistemology which  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1101) i would recommend as a good introduction  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1103) although it's not the best there are a  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1104) couple others  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1106) you could read before this one i think  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1108) it's  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1109) you know probably the third best intro  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1113) for you to read it does go into a bit of  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1115) detail that you don't need  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1117) in terms of a basic introduction but  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1119) moon summarizes the thesis as i've said  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1121) the thesis  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1123) reform epistemology is the thesis or the  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1125) idea that religious belief can be  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1127) rational  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1127) and i put justified and warranted as  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1130) well  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1131) these are concepts we're gonna um you  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1133) know touch on  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1134) in the next slides without arguments  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1137) um so that's that's a basic thesis and  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1141) this is what  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1142) we're going to try to do in chat online  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1145) i just want to again double check  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1146) everybody is with me i'm  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1149) i'm seeing that some people are  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1150) struggling to hear me my microphone is  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1152) not the best  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1153) but uh all i can say is do your very  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1156) best to  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1157) turn the sound up as much as possible  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1161) and insha'allah um things will be okay  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1165) all right so gathering our conceptual  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1169) token  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1169) now i've said so far that we want to  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1172) offer  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1173) um a model of reformed epistemology we  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1175) want to  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1176) um show how it's possible that our  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1179) belief in god  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1181) and uh by extension even our belief in  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1184) islam which we'll get to  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1185) can be rational even if we don't have  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1187) good arguments  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1188) but if we want to build a robust thesis  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1191) it's a robust model  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1192) we're going to have to gather our own  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1194) little toolkit of concepts  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1196) we don't need rulers and pencils and  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1198) spanners and screwdrivers of course  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1200) we need concepts we need um ideas  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1204) that are going to help us flesh out this  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1206) thesis in a in an academic way  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1208) insha'allah so  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1209) this is what we're going to try and do  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1211) first of all we're going to try and  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1212) gather our concepts  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1213) and we're going to take those concepts  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1215) and apply those concepts  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1217) to the model itself and childbirth  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1220) so epistemology you know just to clarify  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1222) what do we mean by epistemology so  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1224) epistemology is a sub-branch or  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1227) sub-discipline  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1228) of philosophy so philosophy um  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1232) you know it's debatable what what the  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1234) definition of it is but you might think  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1237) of it as the discipline of using reason  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1240) uh to essentially answer the fundamental  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1243) questions  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1244) uh of life and that can be broken into  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1247) different  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1248) um components so you might have um  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1251) a philosophy that looks at religion  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1253) looks at specifically  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1254) religious questions that we try to use  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1256) reason to answer  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1258) and that's what we're doing here we're  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1259) thinking about um  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1261) the existence of god that for instance  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1263) whether he exists whether we can be  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1265) justified in believing in existence we  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1266) have other branches of um  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1268) philosophy like ethics which looks at um  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1271) that moral truth  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1272) could there be such a thing as as moral  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1274) truths that's a meta ethical question  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1276) and and if they are how could we um  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1279) come to know these for instance and um  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1282) and there are different theories  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1284) about what constitutes the good and so  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1286) on now epistemology  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1288) is another branch epistemology is  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1290) concerned specifically  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1292) with knowledge and so  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1295) what are the conditions that our belief  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1297) might need such that  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1300) we can say oh this belief is not just a  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1302) mere beliefs not just an opinion there  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1303) this this is knowledge  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1305) and it looks at concepts like  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1306) justification right rationality what  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1308) does it mean for you to be justified  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1311) and holding your belief and how does  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1313) that relate to  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1314) knowledge so that's broadly  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1318) and very roughly epistemology and um  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1321) uh insha'allah you know any of you who  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1323) want to  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1325) read more you can do and you know there  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1328) are plenty of  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1329) basic introductions online so  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1333) we're gonna now i'm trying to list some  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1335) of the concepts that we're gonna look at  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1336) these are  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1337) concepts that we're gonna try to put in  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1338) our toolkit and apply  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1340) to our model  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1343) we're gonna look at a very sort of  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1346) rudimentary  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1348) introductory account of knowledge which  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1350) is  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1352) sometimes as a tripartite definition  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1355) and because it includes three components  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1357) namely  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1358) belief truth and justification and we're  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1360) going to look at whether that is  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1362) a sufficient account for knowledge  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1365) and we're going to look at another  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1366) concept called warrant which i'll just  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1369) leave it as it is for now  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1370) and proper functionalism which is a an  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1373) account of what warrant is  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1375) um which will become clear as soon as  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1377) we're going to look at the difference  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1378) between  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1379) basic beliefs and non-basic beliefs now  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1382) if you remember the  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1383) first slide the very title of this  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1385) webinar  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1386) uses properly basic islamic belief and  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1389) so  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1390) in sha allah after we've got that  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1392) concept it's going to be clear  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1393) what my title actually meant at the very  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1395) beginning so we have basically these  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1396) numbers  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1397) we have probably basically that'll be  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1399) clear insha'allah  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1401) okay so  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1404) let's look at this sort of rudimentary  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1406) introductory account and knowledge  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1410) um as being jtb  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1413) justified true belief so  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1416) let's give you give you an example um  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1420) let's suppose you have a belief you  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1422) believe that um all  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1424) elephants are pink in color this is a  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1427) belief that you just find yourself  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1428) having it just comes to you  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1429) spontaneously  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1431) um and um yeah you believe it to be true  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1435) now could you know that um or  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1439) would you know uh that's true  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1442) would that belief be sufficient for  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1444) knowledge um  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1445) well obviously it wouldn't and um  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1448) there's an obvious reason why because  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1450) it's missing  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1451) a vital ingredient and well what's that  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1454) ingredient  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1455) obviously that ingredient is truth it  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1457) misses  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1458) the ingredient of truth the reason why  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1460) your belief that elephants  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1462) are all pink in color couldn't  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1464) constitute knowledge  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1465) is because it simply isn't true and  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1468) knowledge  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1470) necessarily assumes that we're talking  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1472) here of something that's true  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1475) all right so we know that having a mere  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1478) belief  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1478) is not sufficient for us to have  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1481) knowledge  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1482) well what about a  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1486) true belief if i have a belief that's  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1488) true  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1489) then surely i can know it so let's  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1491) suppose  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1492) um you have another belief you believe  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1497) um i've used this example before um  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1501) let's suppose you believe that  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1502) accrington stanley  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1505) are going to beat manchester united five  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1508) nil  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1509) in the third round of the ethical for  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1512) those of you not familiar with these  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1513) things this is football um i don't know  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1516) if people are from different places but  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1517) yeah so imagine you've got two teams  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1519) playing football  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1520) um you know i'm using manchester united  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1523) in this example because i don't  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1524) i don't support them i spot liverpool so  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1526) i want them to lose in the example  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1528) um anyway sorry for those who think  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1531) otherwise  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1532) uh so there's a big golfing class in the  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1535) two teams and um  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1536) and so you know if you just if you have  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1539) the belief that you know manchester  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1540) united  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1540) lose at their home stadium five nil  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1542) they're gonna be knocked out of the  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1543) competition  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1544) and you know that they have all of their  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1546) star players key players in hackington  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1548) who are already you know nowhere near  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1552) the quality of manchester united also  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1554) have key players missing from their side  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1556) um but then lo and behold it turns out  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1560) that um manchester united lose five nil  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1564) at home and you were right all along so  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1567) you had a belief and that belief turned  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1571) out to be  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1571) true but did you know  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1575) that this was gonna happen did you know  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1577) that manchester united were gonna lose  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1578) five now well  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1579) we'd be inclined to say now of course  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1581) you didn't know it was i mean i guess it  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1583) was um  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1584) a case of epistemic luck you had a lucky  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1588) belief that turned out to be true  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1590) so a mere belief isn't sufficient for  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1593) knowledge  
[0:26:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1594) true belief isn't even sufficient for  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1596) knowledge  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1597) there seems to be something else that  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1599) we're lacking here  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1601) um it seems that  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1604) we are lacking some reason or some  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1608) connection um or ground  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1611) that supports our true belief and this  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1614) is known as justification so  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1616) let's suppose you have a third belief  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1618) you believe that it's raining outside  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1621) you look out your window and you see the  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1623) rain you know steaming down against the  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1625) rooftops across your street and you hear  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1627) the pitter-patter sound  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1629) of the rain you know splattering across  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1632) uh not across on your windows  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1636) um and and it actually is raining it  
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1639) seems that you have a belief that belief  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1641) is  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1641) true and you have justification for that  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1644) but it seems that  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1645) you know you can hear the sound of rain  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1648) you can  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1649) see the sound of rain and maybe even if  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1650) you have a window open you can kind of  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1652) smell the effects  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1654) of rain on the grass or the soil or  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1657) something like that so  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1657) it seems you have a a um  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1661) account of knowledge here doesn't it it  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1663) seems though you know that that's true  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1664) you have a justify true belief and  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1665) therefore  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1666) that's sufficient for knowledge  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1670) so um just to sort of  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1673) put this a little bit more clearly um  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1677) i want to um to help you by clarifying  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1680) what i mean by justification  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1682) so justification is um  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1685) roughly the idea at least this is the  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1688) way it's  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1689) being used predominantly in the 20th  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1692) century um and even 21st century  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1696) um epistemology but certainly in the  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1698) 20th century  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1699) it's the idea of um well  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1702) even in western epistemology per se but  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1704) it's the idea of um  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1707) fulfilling your your epistemic duties it  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1709) seems you have  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1710) a sort of duty to um try  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1714) and access the evidence for yourself to  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1716) try and  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1717) um counter some objections to your  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1720) belief  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1721) and to have some reason that you you can  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1724) reflectively access  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1726) that supports a belief that you you have  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1730) so that's what we mean roughly by  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1731) justification  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1733) and so it seems as i mentioned in our  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1735) reign example  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1736) you have um these sensory  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1740) perceptual beliefs that are accessed to  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1742) you  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1743) you have this strong the strong seeming  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1746) um and and so it seems that you have  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1750) you have what we call justification now  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1752) subhanallah just reminded me that  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1754) on the slide um on reformed epistemology  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1759) i had a picture  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1760) of like a head with a tree inside it and  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1764) many of you are probably wondering why  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1766) on earth i i had that  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1769) uh why i had that picture and i forgot  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1773) to  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1773) mention why um that has any  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1776) relation whatever whatsoever to perform  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1779) the epistemology well  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1781) it the idea is that for instance when  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1783) you when you see  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1784) a tree outside or in front of you it  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1787) this  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1788) uh sensuous imagery just impresses  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1791) itself on your mind almost as if  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1793) you have this image the strong seaming  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1796) of the tree the image in the mind that's  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1798) being pressed upon  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1799) and so you have this image you have this  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1801) reason that's accessible to you  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1803) and reformed epistemology can be seen as  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1806) saying that  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1807) but you know in different ways that it's  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1810) possible that  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1811) you know the presence or the awareness  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1813) of god can be sort of impressed upon the  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1815) mind  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1816) in a way that's similar of course not in  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1819) the sense of seeing imagery  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1821) but in the sense of being pressed upon  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1822) the mind so  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1824) yeah i'm sorry i didn't mention that um  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1826) but but not to worry so  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1828) this is what we mean by by by knowledge  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1830) as  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1831) has been construed in terms of justified  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1833) true belief  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1836) however although it seems like a  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1838) plausible account  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1840) um so far  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1843) um it's not actually a count that  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1846) anybody accepts anymore  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1847) in epistemology and philosophy there is  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1849) a problem with this and um  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1852) this is known as the gettier problem  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1853) there is a famous um  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1855) philosopher who is um  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1858) called edmund gettier who wrote a famous  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1861) paper i think in 1963 it was only three  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1864) pages long but it sort of transformed  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1867) the whole discipline of epistemology  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1870) and he showed conclusively really by  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1873) just by way of i think  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1875) three or two examples um  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1878) that you can have justify true belief  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1880) and you you're lacking knowledge  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1882) somehow okay so so let  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1886) how might that be so we're questioning  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1889) here whether the jtb account really  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1892) sufficient for accounting for knowledge  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1895) and um and edmund getty as i mentioned  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1897) came to spoil the show for us  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1900) so um you can see that clock on on the  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1903) picture there and uh bertrand russell of  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1906) course  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1907) is um before gettier somewhat um  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1911) but he offers a sort of pre-getty  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1914) gettier example  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1916) and so um it's to do with with a clock  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1919) but i've tried to excite  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1920) you know paint a kind of a different  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1923) picture using the same idea  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1925) so imagine um  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1928) one day you you're going to the dentist  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1930) you have a dentist appointment  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1932) and normally you use your your watch um  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1934) but  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1935) but for some reason you don't have your  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1936) watch suppose it's at the jewelers it's  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1939) under repair  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1940) so you don't have access to it and  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1941) you're not sure of the time now  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1943) so you rush quickly to the dentist  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1945) hoping that you know you've made your  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1946) appointment on  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1947) time and let's say your appointment is  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1950) is that um  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1952) quarter past three and so you you get  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1956) into the  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1956) the waiting room of the dentist  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1960) and you look to the clock and you see  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1963) it's  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1963) oh it says it's um it's three o'clock ah  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1966) so you sit down you're relieved  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1968) because you know you're on time and your  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1971) appointment is going to be in 50 minutes  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1973) now let's suppose that that's that's  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1975) true and it really was free  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1976) three o'clock and you had the belief  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1978) that it's three o'clock  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1980) and you you surely had justification for  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1982) believing that three  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1983) three o'clock because uh you saw the  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1986) clock  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1987) and you know it says it's it's three  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1990) so you have justification for that  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1991) belief but let's suppose  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1993) um that clock wasn't actually working it  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1996) wasn't ticking  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1997) and it just so happened that  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=1999) conveniently  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2001) the clock was left in three um  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2004) but it wasn't ticking it wasn't working  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2006) and let's see it hasn't been working for  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2008) for over a week it's up conveniently  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2011) um it was showing the right time at the  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2014) time and when you've entered  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2015) the time when you've entered so it seems  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2017) here you had a belief  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2019) namely that it's three o'clock that  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2021) belief is true it seems that you had  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2023) some justification because you can see  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2024) the clock saying  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2026) um that is three but  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2029) there seems to be an element of  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2031) epistemic luck here  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2032) because it was just lucky that you saw  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2035) the the clock at the time you did  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2037) so it seems you can have um just to be  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2040) justified true belief and not knowledge  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2042) because surely  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2043) if you just came to this belief by way  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2045) of look  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2046) even though it's justified um you didn't  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2049) really know that it's three o'clock  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2051) so this is a you know a sort of  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2055) a simple example of a gettier case  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2058) and so it just seems that you can have  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2061) justification and truth and  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2063) you can have your belief but you can  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2065) still lack knowledge in some sense  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2068) so what are we to do with this is there  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2071) a way out  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2072) well this is puzzling well  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2076) one of the ways out in the way i'm going  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2079) to be looking at  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2080) is by offering a different account  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2083) knowledge  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2083) which draws on a different concept now  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2086) in the previous slide i mentioned  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2088) justification is about accessing the  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2090) reasons  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2092) that support your belief maybe defending  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2094) that belief if counter objections  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2096) come not fulfilling your epistemic  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2098) duties in some sense  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2100) and so it's it's a lot to do with you  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2102) accessing the beliefs reflectively  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2105) you know they're impressed on your mind  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2106) you think about them or something like  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2108) that  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2109) now warrant is is the idea  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2112) that um well the warrant is defined  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2115) simply as  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2116) that quantity enough of which  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2120) turns a mere true belief into knowledge  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2123) that's all it is simply  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2124) um and warrant differs from  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2127) justification though in  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2129) important ways at least in the way i'm  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2131) going to try  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2132) and demonstrate now  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2136) so a famous philosopher religion  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2140) and philosophy in general alvin  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2141) plantinga he spearheaded this thesis of  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2144) a former epistemology  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2145) and he spearheaded the thesis of of an  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2148) idea of warrant  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2149) um which is based primarily  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2152) on the notion of our faculties um  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2155) functioning properly so as i mentioned  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2157) warrant is that  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2159) the idea of that that special ingredient  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2161) that somehow  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2162) turns and made true belief into  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2165) knowledge  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2165) before we we had a true belief that's  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2167) justified and yet  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2168) it was lacking knowledge it wasn't  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2171) sufficient for knowledge so we need  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2172) something  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2173) that special sauce a special ingredient  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2175) that's going to give  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2176) our belief knowledge now  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2181) we've seen that justification is  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2184) you know roughly about you having access  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2187) to certain reasons  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2190) but we've seen that in many cases  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2193) a few slides ago where we had the belief  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2196) in other persons  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2198) the belief in the external world um  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2201) the belief in in in the past it seems  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2205) that  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2206) we just don't have access to to reasons  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2210) or arguments that make our belief  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2213) sufficient  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2214) for knowledge it seems that in the end  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2217) we simply have to rely on our  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2220) um intuitive the intuitive um  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2224) products of our faculty so when i look  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2227) at the laptop  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2229) um when my eyesight is functioning  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2232) properly  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2233) it just seems to me very clear that i  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2235) can see the laptop and i know the laptop  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2237) is here  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2238) i don't have access to some arguments  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2240) there aren't really good arguments  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2242) it seems that something external to my  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2244) access  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2245) just merely the functioning of my  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2246) faculties is what's  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2248) really at the heart of giving me  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2250) knowledge in all of these cases  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2253) again we believe in other persons  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2255) because our faculties just  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2257) produce this kind of belief and we don't  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2260) seem to have access  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2261) to to reasons necessarily but  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2264) um the mere functioning of our faculties  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2267) as they ought to do  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2268) is sufficient for giving us knowledge so  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2271) here warrant is shifting the focus away  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2274) from  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2275) factors um that you're accessing inside  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2278) your mind reflectively  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2280) and focusing on something external to  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2282) that like just the faculties  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2284) being reliable and functioning properly  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2287) and so this thesis of of warrant  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2290) being based on proper function has  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2293) four conditions and we're going to try  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2296) and look at these conditions one by one  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2298) and then in the end we're going to  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2300) suggest that this  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2303) is the best way to construe the nature  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2305) of  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2306) a belief being sufficient for knowledge  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2309) and then we're going to see if our  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2310) belief in god can  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2312) meet these conditions so the first point  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2315) is the focus on proper functioning  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2318) cognitive faculties  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2320) we have lots of different faculties we  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2322) have faculties of side faculties of  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2324) hearing  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2325) we have faculties for reasoning and they  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2328) they they function in a certain way they  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2331) have  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2332) what planting it calls a design plan a  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2334) way in which they ought to function  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2337) so you know like you have a heart which  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2338) is another faculty  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2340) um a heart is supposed to beat  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2344) you know a number of minutes on average  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2347) uh sorry  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2347) your heart is supposed to be a number of  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2349) beats per minute  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2350) on average and when it um  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2354) you know beats in that way it's  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2355) functioning as it ought to do  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2357) now suppose it wasn't you know barely  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2360) beating at all i suppose there were too  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2361) many beats  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2362) per minute um there'd be something wrong  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2364) with that faculty it's not functioning  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2366) as it ought to do it's not functioning  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2368) according to its design plan  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2370) the way in which it should so that's the  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2373) first point now  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2374) we can see how this is relevant to  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2376) knowledge  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2377) um by way of an example um  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2381) so suppose you have  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2384) a man who lives in the countryside and  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2387) um  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2389) he he he lives in a windy sort of area  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2393) and um when and he has a  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2396) wind chime hanging from his door outside  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2399) and so when the wind uh you know when  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2402) it's windy  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2403) the chime uh you know sounds and then he  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2406) forms the belief  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2407) that it's windy outside and so  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2410) you know it seems that he's fulfilling  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2413) his uh  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2414) he's justified he has a belief that's  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2416) accessible to him  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2418) in other words he hears that sound and  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2420) on the basis of that  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2421) he he infers the wind plus  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2424) but suppose when he got older he  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2428) suffered from  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2428) some cognitive malfunctioning  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2432) suppose that um you know he couldn't  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2435) hear anymore  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2436) so he's not able to hear the the wind  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2439) chimes anymore  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2440) but he also suffers from some kind of  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2442) cognitive disease  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2444) which makes him occasionally have these  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2448) auditory hallucinations where he he  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2451) hears  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2452) this wind chiming sound and let's  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2454) suppose  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2455) um he hears this winning shining sound  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2458) on occasion  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2459) when the wind is actually blowing and  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2460) the wind chime is chiming but  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2462) of course his belief is formed by  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2466) by way of sort of a hallucination so it  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2469) seems  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2470) that he you know he has a belief that he  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2473) can reflectively  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2474) access he can be justified in a sense  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2477) but because his faculty is not  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2480) functioning properly  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2481) he doesn't really know that the wind is  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2483) blowing um  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2484) on the basis of the wind chimes chiming  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2488) because um it's just a an auditory  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2490) hallucination  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2491) because his faculties are not  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2492) functioning properly so it seems it's  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2494) essential  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2495) that we have proper functioning  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2497) cognitive faculties um  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2499) and and that's the first condition  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2502) the second condition i try to sort of  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2504) speed things up  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2505) is that these faculties be aimed the  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2507) truth and so you know if these faculties  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2509) were not aimed at truth  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2510) then how would we be sure that the  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2512) belief we have is really true and not  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2514) just  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2514) um acquired for some other reason  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2517) and the other condition is that it  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2520) occurs in an appropriate environment  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2522) i'm going to touch on that and that it  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2524) should be  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2525) successful in some sense this um the  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2528) faculty's  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2529) imminent truth so  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2533) that's the conditions roughly okay so  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2536) the proper function condition um as i've  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2539) mentioned this is the idea that we have  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2540) cognitive faculties  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2542) which um function in a certain way they  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2544) have design plans that is to say that  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2546) they  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2546) have um a way that they ought to  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2549) function  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2551) so um yeah consider the following  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2554) just to sort of cement this within the  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2555) mind so suppose um you look outside into  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2558) your garden  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2559) and you see what appears to you to be a  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2561) rabbit  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2562) you see it you know sort of hopping  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2564) around  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2565) on the grass and then you know you have  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2568) your friends come up to you and um  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2570) they tell you oh no it's not a rabbit um  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2573) that's actually a squirrel  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2574) and then you realize oh yeah i wasn't  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2576) wearing my glasses then you put your  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2577) glasses  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2578) on and then you um you see it's clearly  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2581) a squirrel  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2582) now the the the first belief you had  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2584) namely that there was a rabbit  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2586) in the garden um it didn't have warrant  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2588) for you it wasn't  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2589) sufficient for knowledge because your  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2592) eyesight wasn't functioning properly  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2594) without the glasses  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2595) and so um it's clear how proper function  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2598) is necessary  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2600) for you to to reach knowledge so so  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2602) that's the first point  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2603) that if your faculties are not  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2605) functioning properly and you're  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2607) you are in some sense then of course you  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2610) you know your belief  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2611) might just be lucky one you know it's  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2613) not clearly  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2615) one that would be warranted for you and  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2617) as i  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2618) and that's the idea that um warrant  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2621) um needs to be secured by proper  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2623) functioning faculties  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2624) if there is some cognitive  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2626) malfunctioning obviously you don't know  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2629) truth aimed condition so  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2632) the other condition is that you know  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2635) your faculties  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2636) um they aim at truth uh in some sense  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2640) um so you know you um  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2644) you form a belief that the laptop is in  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2646) front of you or something else  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2648) now if this um  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2652) if your faculties were aiming just for  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2655) survival  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2656) or fulfilling wishes or something like  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2658) that then it seems  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2660) you know you wouldn't be able to have  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2662) warrant because you couldn't be sure  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2663) that your belief is  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2664) true there is something else going on  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2667) here darwinian survival for instance  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2669) darwinian mechanism suggests that you  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2671) form beliefs to help you  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2672) survive and reproduce well if that's the  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2674) case how can we be sure that even our  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2675) belief  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2676) in darwinian evolution is not just a  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2678) belief that helps to survive rather than  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2680) being true  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2680) so truth aim is a necessary condition  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2682) and it seems in that sense it could be a  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2684) problem for naturalism  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2685) at least on a darwinian account  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2689) and also there is this idea that this  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2691) needs to be  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2692) occurring in an environment that is um  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2698) suitable for your faculties so suppose a  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2700) little bit like in the picture  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2702) you enter a room and you you um  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2706) you you look out of a window let's say  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2708) you think it's a window  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2709) and you see some some scenery up there  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2712) uh and you know you think oh this is  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2713) this is lovely this is beautiful  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2715) but but actually it was just um a  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2718) television  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2719) a television screen that just was really  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2721) realistic  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2722) and so your faculties were functioning  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2724) fine they're aimed at truth  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2726) and so on but you know you were tricked  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2728) your environment was tricked it wasn't  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2730) suitable for your faculties and of  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2732) course our design plans must be  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2734) successful even if they aim at truth  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2736) um but let's say that they get one true  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2740) belief  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2741) um out of a hundred so 99 wrong  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2744) one true then you wouldn't have warrant  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2746) because um most of the time  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2748) you know your beliefs are all they're  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2750) all false so  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2751) on the time you get it right you know  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2753) you have no reason to suspect that  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2756) no um so the idea then is  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2759) a belief is sufficient for knowledge if  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2762) it's produced by faculties that function  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2764) properly and successfully in the truth  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2767) in environments for which they're  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2768) designed to apply  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2771) finally you know someone still might say  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2773) well don't we need an  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2774) access condition that is don't we need  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2776) to access the reasons  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2778) um you know for our belief to be  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2780) warranted  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2781) um but it just seems you know as we said  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2784) in the um  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2786) one of the earlier slides again that i  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2788) believe in other persons in the past in  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2789) the external world and so on  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2790) we just don't seem to have access to the  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2792) reasons that confer  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2793) warrant on our on those beliefs but  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2796) still we can have warrants  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2799) um yeah i'm aware of the time of  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2802) analog i'm going on a little bit but  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2804) i'll try to speed things up so  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2806) um the final concept to grasp  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2811) before we move on to our model  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2816) is the notion of basic and non-basic  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2818) beliefs  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2820) so consider  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2824) belief chain we can have chains so  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2827) suppose you have a belief um  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2830) that there is someone at your your door  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2834) because you heard the doorbell ring so  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2837) you have like two beliefs here you have  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2839) number one the belief that the doorbell  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2841) rang that's something that you hear  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2843) comes to you immediately and then two  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2846) you form the belief  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2847) uh from that you infer a second belief  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2849) that there's someone that you don't  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2850) now the first belief that comes to you  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2853) immediately  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2854) without argument or inference  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2858) um is something known as a basic belief  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2860) sometimes  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2861) uh it's seen as like a foundation i  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2863) believe like  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2864) we we have this is a foundation from  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2866) which we form other boots but  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2868) the basic idea is um the  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2871) part pardon the pun there but the basic  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2873) idea is  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2874) that this belief comes to you  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2876) immediately it's not a belief you hold  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2878) by way of argument so again  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2879) i see the laptop in front of me that's  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2881) just a basic belief it's something that  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2883) comes to me  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2883) immediately i don't hold that belief on  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2886) on  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2887) on by way of argument i don't argue from  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2890) the  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2890) proposition or premise rather that it  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2892) appears to me there's a laptop in front  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2894) of me  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2895) and to the conclusion therefore there's  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2896) a laptop no again with our belief in the  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2899) past with our belief in external world  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2901) and  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2901) and of the minds these are just basic  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2903) beliefs they just come to us intuitively  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2904) and we don't hold them  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2905) by way of other vapes non-basic beliefs  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2908) obviously beliefs we hold  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2910) um by way of inference i can't believe  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2913) that there's someone at the door this is  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2914) something inferred from another belief  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2917) and then we have a notion of properly  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2919) basic beliefs so imagine you know again  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2921) you have  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2922) you have your basic belief you see the  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2923) rain outside  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2925) um that's a basic belief it just comes  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2928) to you immediately  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2929) now if that belief is warranted for you  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2931) if that belief  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2932) is produced by faculties that are  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2934) functioning properly aimed at truth and  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2936) so on  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2937) then that's a properly basic belief so  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2938) it's a basic belief in nature  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2940) that's also warranted for you and so  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2943) the central claim of reformed  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2946) epistemology  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2948) is the idea that god can be a property  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2950) basically we can  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2952) come to belief in god in a basic way  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2956) and that belief can be warranted now  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2959) just as a as a final  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2960) side point on this slide it's clear that  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2963) not just any old belief can be basically  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2966) like let's suppose  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2968) i just suddenly have the belief that  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2970) next week  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2971) on alternate days uh it will rain  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2976) now you know someone say well you know  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2978) clearly  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2979) you need an argument that you need to  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2981) infer that on the basis of other beliefs  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2983) maybe on the basis of  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2985) you know reading the weather forecast or  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2987) something  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2988) it just seems that we can't hold that  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2990) belief in a basic way  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2992) but when it comes to you know your  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2994) belief in the  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2995) that it's raining outside you see that  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2998) it seems you can hold that in a basic  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=2999) way so  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3001) how can we differentiate between a  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3003) belief that's like properly basic  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3005) and i believe this that's not  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3008) obviously a properly basic belief is one  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3010) which is warranted  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3011) but also it seems that the difference  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3013) between  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3014) beliefs that just basic and beliefs  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3017) which are  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3018) properly basic it relates to the very  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3021) nature of our belief  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3022) forming faculties we have faculties for  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3025) forming beliefs about things in front of  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3027) us  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3027) we have faculties for forming sounds  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3029) that we hear nearby  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3031) or we have faculties of taste we have  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3035) faculties of of reason and inference but  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3038) we don't have belief forming faculties  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3039) that can just  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3040) tell us that it's going to be raining um  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3043) on alternate days next week  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3045) like that we just don't have those  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3046) faculty so  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3048) the idea might be to bear in mind that  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3050) it seems we could argue  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3052) maybe we have a faculty that um  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3055) performing beliefs about god and  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3058) certainly studies in cognitive science  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3059) or religion  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3060) are suggested with this in some sense  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3064) so we have our concepts insha'allah i  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3066) hope it's clear just to  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3068) reiterate a few things um well just to  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3071) tell you that i have an essay coming out  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3073) which is  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3073) basically um on this topic  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3077) and so insha'allah that should be out  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3078) very soon on the website  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3080) and obviously you'll be able to follow  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3083) things  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3083) through more clearly so you'll have that  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3086) reading you can download it print it do  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3088) what you want with it  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3089) and so this webinar is just a um an  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3092) introduction for you to kind of  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3094) get to grips with the the basic idea  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3097) and help you understand the essay in  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3099) childhood so  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3100) we've got our concepts now we want to  
[0:51:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3103) outline  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3104) our plan in applying this to uh belief  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3107) in god  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3108) more specifically and then islam as well  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3111) and  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3112) um and constructing that model  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3115) so we're trying to build a model of  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3116) reform of history  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3118) which is designed to show how theism  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3120) namely the belief in god and islamic  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3122) belief can be  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3123) properly basic it can be a belief that  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3125) we hold not on the basis of other  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3126) beliefs  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3127) just intuitively not on the basis of  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3129) argument and that belief can be  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3131) warranted for us  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3133) warranted along the lines of proper  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3134) functioning the idea as we said earlier  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3137) um that  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3138) is produced by faculties that function  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3141) properly  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3141) aimed at truth in environments suitable  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3144) for it  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3146) and we want to show how this is in some  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3148) sense some sense consistent  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3150) on an islamic um you know scheme  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3154) and so as i mentioned the the the  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3157) central  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3158) uh sort of you know well clearly the  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3161) central figure or the only figure  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3162) that i'm proposing this model on is  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3164) having tamiya and the central notion  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3167) in the model is the is the notion of  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3171) so that's going to be key um to  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3173) understanding  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3174) how that belief in god can be properly  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3177) basic  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3178) for us so  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3181) we have this standard tamiya model and i  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3183) want to just quickly give you an  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3184) overview and then we just ran it trying  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3186) to go through it point by point  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3188) so the idea is that a loss of panelist  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3191) adder has instilled within human beings  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3194) different faculties in order to acquire  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3195) tribally so we have different faculties  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3197) you know sense perception reason sight  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3200) hearing  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3201) um and these faculties have been placed  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3203) within us by allah  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3206) in order to form beliefs about um  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3209) things in the world true beliefs and  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3212) allah  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3212) he created them meaning human beings  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3215) upon  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3216) a natural constitution um which we're  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3219) going to call the hippala  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3220) and of course allah created us all upon  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3222) the fitra and that  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3225) urges us to know uh to know that  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3231) three the fifth um  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3234) this disposition has been set to work in  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3238) tandem with our other faculties  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3240) so when one's fiddler functions as it  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3243) should  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3243) it can trigger within the heart  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3247) also can be considered uh of translated  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3249) as mind  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3251) immediate awareness of allah  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3255) and this typically arises  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3259) we could say from the apprehension of  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3261) the many  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3263) or science in the created world  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3267) therefore through this role that the  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3270) fitra  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3271) plays in giving us knowledge and in  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3273) conjunction with the heart  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3275) upon the apprehension of god's signs  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3277) belief in him can be reached immediately  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3279) without  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3280) without needing arguments all right  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3284) so let's try and go through this a bit  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3285) faculties for knowing so  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3287) it's clear that allah gave us these  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3289) faculties  
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3290) for knowing for knowing him for  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3292) worshiping him  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3293) as he mentions in the quran it is allah  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3296) it is god who brought you out of your  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3297) mother's  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3298) wombs knowing nothing and gave you  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3301) hearing  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3301) sight and hearts that you might be  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3304) thankful  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3306) now as a side note um  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3310) in lane's lexicon uh he explained that  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3313) um the term used here effide is plural  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3318) of  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3322) and he explains that um literally  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3326) uh for ed means heart but also refers to  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3329) mind or intellect  
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3330) um so that's something to bear in mind  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3332) as well with what we're saying  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3334) and also um  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3338) himself said and i noticed i forgot the  
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3341) page number for this  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3342) this is in the much more in volume 9 i  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3346) can get the page number for those  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3347) interests  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3348) um yeah so the heart was created to know  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3351) things  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3352) this pursuit of things out of a desire  
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3354) for knowledge it's called thought and  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3355) reflection  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3356) just as the ears pursuit of speech  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3358) design to hear it is god listening  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3360) and the eyes attention to things trying  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3362) to view them is called sight  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3363) so it's clear that you know allah has  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3367) created us with different faculties  
[0:56:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3370) um for true belief or knowledge  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3374) and um and even tamiya  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3377) um obviously on his scheme and we're  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3380) using his epistemic scheme  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3382) he um you know he makes us clear that  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3385) the heart  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3387) is central in that sense um i've just  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3390) known someone say  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3391) slow down we're taking notes don't worry  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3393) insha'allah i can send  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3394) these to people uh the slides i mean  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3398) afterwards and also but you're gonna  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3401) have my essay which has got  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3403) pretty much all of these quotes anyway  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3405) okay  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3406) so we mentioned that the fifa is central  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3410) to the model okay  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3413) so we know that is mentioned in the  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3415) quran  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3416) you know allah  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3430) and we know the hadith um the famous  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3433) hadith  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3434) that every child is born on the fifa  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3437) it's only the parents  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3438) of the christian the jew the zoroastrian  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3442) that you know changes or tampers with  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3446) that  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3447) initial state  
[0:57:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3451) so we know that this is a clearly  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3452) islamic concept  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3454) now even tammy himself said  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3457) that what the prophet meant in the  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3460) hadith  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3462) is that there is a certain nature with  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3464) which allah created man  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3467) and that is the nature of islam and by  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3470) which he meant  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3471) simply and allah endowed all human  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3475) beings with this essential nature the  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3476) day he addressed them saying  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3478) am i not your lord and they said yes we  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3479) have testified  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3481) see that there in uh sort of 7  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3485) verse 1 2. is the original nature of man  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3490) uncorrupted by later beliefs and  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3491) practices ready to accept  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3494) the true notions of islam  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3497) so let's get a little bit clearer on um  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3500) what  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3501) might mean to contain the edges so we  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3503) can um  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3504) you know cement this notion central to  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3507) the model within the mind  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3509) they've been taking me elsewhere said  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3512) that it has been shown  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3513) that in the human beings there exists  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3516) a potency or an urge  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3519) to believe in truth and intend the  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3521) beneficial  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3523) the fitrah has the potency to know and  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3525) believe in the creator  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3526) and the also has a potency for  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3530) his oneness  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3533) now what is um  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3538) becoming clear here is that the third  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3541) is not merely in just a disposition  
[0:59:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3545) of that like a human like human nature  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3549) um you know a sort of stagnant  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3551) disposition that we're all created upon  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3553) but  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3553) it's a it's a it's a normative  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3556) disposition it's something that  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3557) pushes us towards believing certain  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3560) things it  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3560) pushes us towards the belief in truth  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3563) uh and to intend what's beneficial to  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3566) believe in the creator  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3568) and to believe that he is one and to  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3569) worship him  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3571) so so that's central to the idea of  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3573) thought and imitating means  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3575) that scheme ivan tamiya suggests here  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3579) that the  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3580) the locus of the fifa is the heart  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3584) and he said that allah made the fitra of  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3586) his servants  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3587) disposed to the apprehension and  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3589) understanding of the realities of things  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3591) and to know them  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3593) and if it were not for this readiness  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3595) within the hearts  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3597) or minds to know the truth neither  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3599) speculative reasoning would be possible  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3601) nor demonstration discuss a language so  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3604) the fitra is  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3605) central to the whole cognitive  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3608) scheme of the human being  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3613) so we mentioned the fedra  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3616) you know it's places within the heart as  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3618) anything you suggest that so what's the  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3620) sort of cognitive relationship between  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3621) the heart  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3622) and and the again i've got a picture  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3626) with the brain but  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3628) you can just think of that as a football  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3630) all right  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3631) so here's the idea here's the scheme  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3635) that we're gonna  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3636) there are well there are different ways  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3637) you could you could put this sort of  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3639) diagram  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3640) um and i'm actually going to  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3644) land upon this in another essay that i'm  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3646) writing in a journal  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3648) but um so now we can think about it like  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3651) this in terms of its relation to believe  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3653) in god so  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3655) when the um the heart  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3658) reaches a cognitive state um  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3661) that that it believes in god as long as  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3664) the philosophers function  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3665) properly it will result in a basic  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3668) belief in god that is  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3670) a belief immediately for without  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3671) arguments and that belief will be  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3673) properly basic as long as  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3675) the fifa is functioning properly in the  
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3678) heart is functioning properly  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3681) and so the acknowledgement of god's  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3685) existence 17 years  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3686) and knowledge of him and loving him and  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3688) unifying him  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3689) are from the fifa and firm  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3693) so you know this  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3697) acknowledgement this um sense of god's  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3700) existence  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3701) it's it's from the football and it's  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3703) firm in the heart when things are all  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3705) functioning  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3706) accordingly so  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3710) how how might this occur how might it be  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3712) the case  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3713) that we end up with uh belief in god in  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3716) a basic  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3716) way well even tamiya seems to suggest  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3720) this in reference to the concept of a  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3722) yes and he has this notion of  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3724) is idea of an inference  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3727) through science again it's not an  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3729) inference in the traditional sense  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3731) because  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3731) the belief that's produced here is basic  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3734) but uh  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3734) the inference is really the only way of  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3736) translating it so  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3738) um even samia said that proving  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3742) or establishing god's existence by way  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3745) of science is something  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3746) waging something obligatory because this  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3748) is the way of the quran  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3749) and the inheriting of the servants so  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3753) um we we see allah subhanahu wa to  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3756) animaking mention of various ayat  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3758) in the quran that are signs for people  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3761) who reflect  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3762) the people who remember for people who  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3764) reason for people who believe  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3766) or have faith and um  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3770) this might occur for instance upon you  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3772) know pondering the  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3773) the night sky or the glorious blender of  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3775) the cosmos and seeing design in nature  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3778) or  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3778) numerous different in numerous different  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3780) circumstances  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3782) as long as the fitbit is functioning as  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3784) it ought to do  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3786) um the apprehension of such signs can  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3788) produce  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3789) belief um in god  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3793) immediately and eben tamiya  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3796) um you know he he makes a sort of well  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3799) this is a classical distinction about  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3800) ayatollah  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3802) and as well so ayatollah emphasis is the  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3805) idea of signs within yourselves  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3807) that's one set of circumstances and ayat  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3811) you know signs in the horizon in the  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3813) cosmos let's say  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3814) um and so there are different sets of  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3816) circumstances in which believing god can  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3818) be  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3819) elicited in an immediate sense as long  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3821) as the filthy is functioning  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3823) as it all to do  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3827) so  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3831) the question we wanna we wanna ask now  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3833) is can  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3834) this take me in a city scheme  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3838) um fit on that  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3841) warrant account proper functionalism  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3842) that we talked about earlier  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3844) well it seems like it definitely can  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3847) um first of all even tamiya has written  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3851) that  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3852) crown's knowledge of truth and his  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3854) confirmation of it and the rejection of  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3856) falsehood and his rejection of it  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3857) so it's clear that the fitra is  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3859) essential  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3860) in aiming all of our faculties at true  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3864) belief um so you can certainly it  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3867) satisfies that truth aim condition  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3869) and we can see that from um the quran  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3873) as as well um but  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3877) the the fit is also essential to the  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3879) proper function of other faculties  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3881) and um and i quoted actually  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3884) who's a friend of mine who who  
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3886) summarizes really well  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3888) when he said that the proper functioning  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3890) of all our epistemic faculties is  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3892) predicated in  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3893) all cases on the health and proper  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3894) functioning of the fifth allah he  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3895) imitate me his  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3896) um scheme and so it seems that our  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3900) faculties  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3902) in question here we talked to the heart  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3904) as being sort of the general seat of all  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3906) cognition and the fitbit  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3908) being there um as long as the  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3911) these things are functioning properly as  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3914) they ought to  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3915) and they're aimed at true belief which  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3916) we see the fifth to be  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3919) and it's clearly aimed at recognition of  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3922) god as we've seen  
[1:05:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3923) it seems perfectly reasonable to to  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3926) think that  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3927) this model can satisfy a proper  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3928) functionalist counter warrant  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3931) and so  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3932) [Music]  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3935) it seems that um theistic belief  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3938) um i should say it's a properly basis of  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3941) course that's meant to be properly basic  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3943) it seems then that we can have um  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3946) you know belief in god in a basic way  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3948) and it can be warranted for us  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3951) um then we can think about this question  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3955) of um  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3957) the burden of proof that we we talked  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3958) about in the second  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3960) slide um if if it  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3963) you know uh appears to you that you have  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3965) um  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3967) belief in god came to you in an  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3969) immediate way  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3970) now if if that's true then um  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3974) it seems that the burden of proof would  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3976) somewhat switch  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3978) um rather than you having to demonstrate  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3980) your belief  
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3981) you you have a basic belief that can be  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3983) warranted and so the atheist has to show  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3985) why it isn't warranted  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3987) now we'll touch on this a little bit  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3988) later  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3990) but we'll leave it there for now on to  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3992) the next slide the fact of the year i'm  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3994) going to just skip that  
[1:06:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3995) okay so we've seen how it could be  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=3998) possible for islamic belief to be  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4001) sorry for theistic belief to be  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4002) warranted  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4004) and to be sufficient for knowledge for  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4005) us without having arguments  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4008) um again of course so far the model is  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4011) on the supposition  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4013) if it's true like we're saying if it's  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4015) true that allah exists and created us in  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4017) such a way  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4018) we're not trying to prove that allah  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4019) exists we're trying to show how  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4021) it's possible we can have warrants we  
[1:07:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4023) can have police that are sufficient for  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4025) knowledge  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4026) um on an islamic scheme so just bear  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4028) that in mind  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4029) and then i'll touch on it um shortly and  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4032) that's relevant to  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4033) what i was saying about the burden of  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4034) proof now we've seen again  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4036) as i said how this can be related to  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4038) theism  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4041) but is there a way we can extend it more  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4043) specifically for our belief in islam  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4045) now even team um elsewhere  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4049) has spoken of um two broad  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4053) categories of science so we have the  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4056) signs which indicate the existence  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4058) um of the lord may  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4062) he be exalted are one his spoken signs  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4064) that he mentions in the quran  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4066) and two signs of his creative acting  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4069) which he created in the souls and the  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4072) cosmos  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4075) now if it's possible that  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4079) you know when the fibre functions  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4082) properly  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4083) and it's aimed at truth as you said when  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4085) we reflect on signs in the cosmos it's  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4087) possible that we can  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4088) you know um come to immediate basic  
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4091) belief in god's existence and presence  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4093) well it's also possible that when we  
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4095) read the ayat the verses in the quran  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4098) the spoken words of allah subhanahu we  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4100) can  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4101) reach basic belief can just come to us  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4104) immediately we can be filled  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4105) with the immediate sense and obviousness  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4108) of allah's  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4109) uh words being true and that this being  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4111) from allah  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4112) and therefore we can culminate now our  
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4115) full model with  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4116) with islam so as long as  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4120) the faculties of in conjunction with the  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4123) heart are functioning properly  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4124) they're aimed at truth then when we read  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4127) the quran it's possible  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4129) that we have basic belief in god and  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4132) that belief  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4133) in conjunction with the proper function  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4136) account of warren can be warranted  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4138) and therefore it can be sufficient for  
[1:09:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4140) knowledge and therefore we can know  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4142) the truth of islam in a basic way  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4144) without it  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4145) so i just want to um give you a complete  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4148) overview of this  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4150) extended element of the model and then  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4152) i'll just touch on something that i've  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4153) mentioned i'll  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4154) touch on about the assumptions here so  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4157) from points one to five of the standard  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4160) model we have six so  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4161) just as allah has made available an  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4163) immediate apprehension of his existence  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4165) through his many signs in the created  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4166) world so  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4167) too has he permitted more intimate  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4169) knowledge of him through the signs in  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4171) his revelation  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4173) seven upon apprehension of these  
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4175) revelatory signs  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4176) that are read and understood um  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4179) this is something that uh that um  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4182) even tammy's student i'm obtaining with  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4184) those it refers to  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4187) i i don't have the score here but it's  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4188) messy so upon  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4190) apprehension of these revelatory signs  
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4192) that uh in the quran that are read and  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4194) understood  
[1:09:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4195) human beings can acquire basic beliefs  
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4197) in the truth of god's revelation and  
[1:09:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4199) hence the truth of his religion  
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4202) this immediate belief of the truth uh or  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4206) in the truth of islam  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4207) arises through the natural workings of  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4208) the fibra in conjunction with the heart  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4211) upon apprehension of these signs  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4213) that is the verses of the quran  
[1:10:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4215) therefore  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4217) full-fledged islamic belief can be  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4218) acquired in immediate and basic fashion  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4221) without regards to arguments  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4225) okay so that's  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4228) the model and we've tried to apply  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4232) our epistemic concept to it  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4237) now we're going to discuss uh a few  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4239) problems with the model  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4240) people might have before i conclude but  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4242) the first thing to say is this well  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4245) you've been saying uh or some might say  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4248) you've been saying that  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4250) you know allah created us and um and so  
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4253) on so you've been assuming the truth of  
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4254) islam all the way through  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4256) and i say yeah so we're saying if it's  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4258) true  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4259) um but why should i suspect that it's  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4261) true someone might say why should i  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4262) suspect that my belief is true well  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4265) as i mentioned earlier it seems that  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4268) what we do  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4269) uh in in in many cases if not most  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4272) i'll believe in the laptop being in  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4273) front of me i believe in the past  
[1:11:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4276) our belief in the external world um  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4279) our belief in other persons we  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4282) it seems that reasons are not  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4284) necessarily accessible to us but we rely  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4289) on and trust the output  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4292) of our cognitive faculties we rely on  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4294) the output of our cognitive faculties  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4296) and we say as long as they're properly  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4298) functioning aimed at truth and so on  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4299) and our beliefs have warrant and i am  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4302) justified in holding that they are aimed  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4305) at truth and function properly because  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4306) it seems to me that way  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4307) i have no reason to suspect that they're  
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4309) not and so  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4312) in the absence of any defeater through  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4314) your belief  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4315) you seem to be entirely justified in  
[1:11:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4318) in inspecting your beliefs are warranted  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4321) and that  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4321) being produced in the way that they need  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4324) for warrant  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4325) and so you have these beliefs about you  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4328) know things in front of you and so on  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4331) and you're you're relying on your  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4333) cognitive faculties you're trusting them  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4335) in these cases in the absence of any  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4337) reason to suspect there's something  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4339) going wrong  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4340) so that can be naturally extended now to  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4342) our belief  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4343) in islam again just as my other beliefs  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4346) about um things i see before me and  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4349) about other persons in the external  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4351) world and so on  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4352) um as long as there's no reason  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4355) to suspect uh you know i have  
[1:12:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4359) uh a defeater for my belief um it just  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4362) seems obvious to me it seems as clear as  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4364) anything  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4365) as clear as anything else then i have  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4367) justification  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4368) for suspecting my belief is warranted  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4371) and therefore i think that it probably  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4372) is and i'm justified in thinking that  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4374) and so therefore um i'd say my belief  
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4377) is warranted and i can know and i do not  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4380) so  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4381) um that's the way it seems to be  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4385) in the absence of some defeater we are  
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4387) entirely justified  
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4389) in suspecting our belief is fully  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4391) warranted in the same way  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4393) as our other beliefs that we've  
[1:13:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4394) mentioned but  
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4397) we might suspect that people have some  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4399) problems  
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4400) with this and um we'll try and entertain  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4404) some of them so forgive me for the silly  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4408) uh  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4409) image but one uh  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4412) one thing that people have brought up is  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4414) well surely if you say  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4416) you know believing god and islam can be  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4418) properly basic  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4419) we might as well claim that the great  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4421) pumpkin that comes back every halloween  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4423) is properly basic  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4424) you know anyone can say that  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4427) well how would we respond to this well  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4430) first of all obviously because a belief  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4434) is properly basic that doesn't mean that  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4437) just  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4437) any all belief can be properly basic  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4440) suppose you have the belief that  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4442) one plus one is two and you just have  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4444) that belief in the immediate sense  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4446) well and and we know pretty clearly that  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4449) that belief is warranted that that  
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4450) belief is something we know  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4453) why would it follow that because one odd  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4455) one is two  
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4456) is a properly basic belief just anything  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4458) can be a property basically  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4460) well obviously not just anything can be  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4462) profit this week only the beliefs  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4464) held in a basic way by our faculties  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4467) properly functioning and so on as they  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4469) ought to do  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4470) can be a properly basically but  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4473) perhaps that's not what someone means by  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4475) the great pumpkin objection perhaps they  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4477) mean well  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4478) why couldn't it be that a great pumpkin  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4480) could could  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4482) be sufficient for warrants couldn't it  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4483) be that we have this  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4485) great pumpkin artist this great sense of  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4489) a pumpkin  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4490) um as opposed to a census divinitative  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4492) sense of god  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4493) um the great pumpkin has um  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4497) you know created us with  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4501) well what would you say about that well  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4502) first of all unlike  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4505) our theistic belief the great pumpkin  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4507) suffers from an obvious  
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4509) empirical of objection because it's  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4510) something that's physical and so on  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4513) and um and so it if it doesn't have  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4516) empirical evidence for it  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4518) then that would give us reason to  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4520) suspect it doesn't exist  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4522) and but belief in god is quite different  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4524) because belief in god is not something  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4526) observable it can't be disproved in that  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4527) sense  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4529) but moreover why think that there'd be a  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4531) great pumpkin that  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4533) obviously wants to create things and  
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4536) give them true beliefs and obviously  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4538) cares about them in some way  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4539) it just seems that the way you're  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4541) glossing this up is you're just  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4543) picking another term for god you're  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4545) actually thinking about  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4547) a theistic picture but you're glossing  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4549) it up in other terms  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4550) so i think that's the way one might  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4551) respond to it and there are a number of  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4553) other cases as well  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4554) but i think it suffers from an obvious  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4556) empirical defeater  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4557) and it just seems this is another way of  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4559) losing the thesis picture  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4560) and not just any old belief can be  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4562) properly basic because some are  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4566) well what about religious diversity  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4568) couldn't  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4569) a christian or a jew for instance  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4571) construct a model  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4572) similar to ours on the basis of their  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4576) beliefs  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4579) what do we have to say about this well  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4581) um first of all this idea  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4584) um of a problem of religious diversity  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4589) is um predicated on what i've written  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4591) here e  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4593) wp re means performance margin ewp is  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4596) the equal weight  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4597) principle so it's sort of suggesting  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4599) like in the presence of other people  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4602) who claim they have a model similar to  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4603) yours  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4605) um we should sort of um we have a  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4608) defeater for ours  
[1:16:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4610) because we suspect that they are  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4613) equally justified in holding their own  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4616) model  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4616) but it seems to be a problem with this  
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4618) equal weight principle because  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4620) the equal rate principle is saying that  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4624) our  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4624) epistemic peers who disagree with us we  
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4627) should give equal weight  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4629) to what they say just as much as what we  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4632) say  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4632) given the similar circumstances  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4636) but then um someone who disagrees with  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4639) the equality principle  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4640) and thinks that it's not true then we  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4643) should give equal weight  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4644) to that notion as well and so it seems  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4647) that we are  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4647) self-defeated it seems you know um  
[1:17:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4651) we've like shot ourselves in the foot  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4653) with that principle  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4654) so that's one thing we might think that  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4656) obviously  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4658) um our epistemic peers  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4661) in jews and christians they're not um  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4664) our actual peers in in this sense  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4667) because  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4668) you know as a hadith it's their parents  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4672) that raise them in environments and  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4674) circumstances where they're not  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4675) accessing the sorts of evidences we have  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4678) um for our beliefs about islam they  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4680) don't have access to that somehow  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4682) they've been  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4683) uh deterred from access to that so we  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4685) might think that we are not epistemic  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4687) peers and an equal weight principle um  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4690) is problematic so we might dismiss  
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4692) it that's one thing we might mention but  
[1:18:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4695) there are other problems then with this  
[1:18:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4697) and some people might  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4698) um suggested solutions now um  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4701) i'm just gonna tie things up here i've  
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4703) been going on longer than i wanted to  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4705) you know so please forgive me  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4706) um well a classical response from the  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4709) reformed epistemologist to this  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4712) is to say that you know  
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4715) in the case where you have arguments  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4717) against your belief it's not necessarily  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4720) such that we should give it up unless we  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4723) have another argument so  
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4725) um suppose you um  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4729) you've been accused or suppose  
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4732) somebody's been accused  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4733) of stealing something and um  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4737) suppose that person um  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4740) you know is known for for stealing  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4743) something let's say they're known for  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4744) stealing watches or something like that  
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4746) and then um suppose one day  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4749) you know a watch went missing and it  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4751) ended up being the case that um  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4754) a man seen by cctv looked just like that  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4757) person  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4758) and somehow um some of his items like  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4761) his car keys were next to  
[1:19:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4763) um the table where the watch was taken  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4765) from then a number of evidence  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4767) stacks up against him and so the judge  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4770) in court and the jury they've got good  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4773) reason to suspect a good argument a  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4775) probabilistic  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4776) argument an evidential argument to  
[1:19:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4777) suspect you're guilty but  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4779) um not you the person in question sorry  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4782) um but suppose that that person has a  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4785) very clear and strong  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4787) memory belief and knows that they were  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4789) not there  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4791) on that day but they don't know of any  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4793) other good reason or argument  
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4794) they just have that strong basic belief  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4797) which is clear  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4798) to them and it's true um  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4802) it seems that there would still be  
[1:20:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4803) justified and warranted  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4805) in holding on to their own um basic  
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4808) belief even in  
[1:20:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4810) the um in the face of these reasons  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4813) or arguments against i believe even if  
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4815) they don't have any  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4816) argument to rebut it other than this  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4818) just intuitive belief  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4820) so that's one way to go if we if our  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4822) beliefs  
[1:20:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4824) are the products of our faculties which  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4826) are hard wired  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4827) to um produce certain types of beliefs  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4830) maybe it's just that islamic belief is a  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4832) belief that's you know hardwired  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4835) we are meant to produce this belief and  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4836) so even in the face of arguments  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4839) we um we don't need to respond  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4843) and i'll just give one more solution  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4845) which says well actually no you can use  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4847) arguments  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4848) it would say that it makes a kind of um  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4851) distinction between  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4852) sort of a first and second order level  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4855) of things cognitively speaking so  
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4858) imagine  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4859) you can think about this in terms of a  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4861) lift like imagine on the  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4864) ground floor you you obtain a  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4867) basic belief in god's existence just  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4869) comes to you immediately  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4871) but then on the first floor at the first  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4873) order level  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4875) you get a defeater for your belief let's  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4877) say  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4878) by the problem of religious diversity or  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4880) something or problem of evil or  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4882) something else  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4884) and then on the on the on the second  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4886) floor  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4887) you respond to that defeater you offer a  
[1:21:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4889) defeater defeater  
[1:21:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4891) by giving some reason to suspect that  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4893) that defeater is not  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4895) true then all of a sudden you're  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4897) warranted and holding that belief  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4899) that you have at the very first order  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4902) level  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4902) on the ground floor in a basic way  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4905) um and so you don't need positive  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4908) arguments for your basic belief but you  
[1:21:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4909) might need some arguments to deal with  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4911) the fetus  
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4912) so something like that this is known as  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4913) by evidentialism sometimes  
[1:21:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4915) michael sort of anyway so  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4918) um this is the basic idea inshallah  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4921) i'm going to put my essay out hopefully  
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4923) within a few days for you guys to read  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4924) it  
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4925) and i'm going to now try to take a few  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4928) questions  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4929) but i am wary that i've been going on  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4932) for quite some time  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4933) um but yeah uh let's see  
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4937) insha'allah uh what you guys think  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4940) just as a summary we should we talked  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4942) about warrant as being proper  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4944) functionalism  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4945) that you know belief is warranted if  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4946) only if it's produced by faculty's  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4948) function  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4948) properly and the truth etc uh and then  
[1:22:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4951) we have this idea  
[1:22:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4953) properly basically some basically so i  
[1:22:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4955) can see the laptop in front of me  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4956) properly basic meaning it's warranted  
[1:22:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4959) for me because it's produced by  
[1:22:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4961) proper function faculties etc and then  
[1:22:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4964) we try to apply that to a  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4965) mean standard model showing how you  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4967) think god could be warranted in a  
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4969) similar way  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4970) i believe in islam could be warranted in  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4971) similar way and we try to address a  
[1:22:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4973) couple of concepts so  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4975) insha'allah and i'm going to try to take  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4976) a few questions now  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4978) um i'm kind of confused  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4982) on how to um  
[1:23:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4986) how to use this whole um  
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4990) question bar um  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4994) so please bear with me because  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=4998) it's um i don't know how i can  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5002) make the box bigger it's really really  
[1:23:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5005) small  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5006) and it makes it really really difficult  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5011) this is problem  
[1:23:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5015) ah let's see okay wait i think okay  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5019) here we go  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5022) okay so i'll try to take a few obviously  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5027) um i can't take them all  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5030) so someone said here alex parker asks  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5034) um this is a bit long so i apologize i  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5037) have a potential rebuttal of the atheism  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5039) as default motion  
[1:24:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5041) and i'm interested in your thoughts my  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5042) position is that atheists only apply  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5044) such an epistemological position  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5047) because it seems to be the most  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5048) logically sound one  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5050) however that isn't true because atheism  
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5052) requires one  
[1:24:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5053) to give moral value  
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5056) to truth which  
[1:24:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5060) an atheist worldview cannot substantiate  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5063) hence there is a contradiction and  
[1:24:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5064) atheism isn't logically sound as an  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5066) intellectual  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5068) position um however that isn't true  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5071) because everything requires  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5072) given more ability well i i think  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5075) perhaps you're right  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5076) um i'm not sure but i think  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5079) there is another way to put it which is  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5081) to say that  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5083) there just doesn't seem to be a  
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5085) naturalistic  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5087) uh slash atheistic account of the  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5090) conditions  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5091) of proper functionalism so you know how  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5093) i believe to be warranted  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5095) needs to be produced by faculties  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5098) aimed at truth i just don't see how a  
[1:25:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5100) naturalist account  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5102) can guarantee is that our um beliefs are  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5106) aimed  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5106) at truth whereas theism can and if it  
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5108) cannot account for that  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5110) then then it would mean that on atheism  
[1:25:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5113) or naturalism all our beliefs  
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5114) would not be warranted but clearly our  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5116) beliefs are warranted  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5118) and so therefore atheism or naturalism  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5120) is false and atheism is true  
[1:25:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5123) okay um another question by amer  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5126) um how do you even know you have a true  
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5131) belief then  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5132) even without justification um so  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5136) the idea here is that you would  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5139) know that your belief is true um  
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5142) in the sense that well you have  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5145) justification  
[1:25:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5146) of believing that it is knowledge this  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5149) goes into a wider discussion about  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5151) externalism and internalism  
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5153) in epistemology but what i'm saying is  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5155) that  
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5157) my um belief in the  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5160) the laptop in front of me um well that's  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5163) a belief i'm justified in holding like i  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5165) know it's true  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5166) in the sense that there is no reason i  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5168) have to suspect that it's not  
[1:26:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5171) and um you know it's clearly warranted  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5175) if it's produced in the way that we  
[1:26:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5178) see that it is seemingly produced and we  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5180) have clearly no reason to suspect  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5182) otherwise and so we cannot  
[1:26:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5184) um so  
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5188) uh how do we distinguish observations  
[1:26:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5191) from knowledge  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5192) what is an observation just something  
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5196) true because you observe it in your  
[1:26:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5199) article you say when the football is  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5200) triggered  
[1:26:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5201) such knowledge will go to the card and  
[1:26:43](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5203) make it true  
[1:26:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5205) but how is the fit that i've triggered  
[1:26:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5207) um  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5209) from my reading is our feelings in outer  
[1:26:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5211) ones give us data and then our brain  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5213) takes them and makes them abstract ideas  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5216) etc um well as i mentioned that  
[1:27:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5220) seems to be triggered on the  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5221) apprehension of aix  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5224) um so that's that's the way i would  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5227) construe that  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5229) okay isn't belief in god  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5233) uh an ever influenced billy from a basic  
[1:27:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5237) belief in material  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5238) world it could be and you know you can  
[1:27:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5240) have  
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5241) uh arguments for existence of god even  
[1:27:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5243) tamiya has suggested that  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5244) people might need arguments whose father  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5246) is um  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5248) corrupt for instance and can't access  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5251) the knowledge of god in a basic way  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5254) um but in our case  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5258) it's just on reflection or  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5261) in the circumstances that we're in we're  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5264) having this belief in god in immediate  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5266) way but you can definitely argue from  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5268) fine tuning let's say in the material  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5271) world or from the beginning of the  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5272) universe  
[1:27:53](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5273) to a creator designer that we call god  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5279) um so this is all for stating that my  
[1:28:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5282) belief in when god is rational without  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5283) empirical evidence because if anything  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5284) says to me that he doesn't believe in  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5286) god  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5286) all this concept then i can't prove it  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5288) to him but i can claim my belief is  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5290) rational  
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5291) yeah i mean the idea that i'm presenting  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5294) here is that  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5295) first of all you can be rational you can  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5297) be justified in believing in god  
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5300) without argument and secondly you could  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5302) even know that  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5303) argument and in just the same ways which  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5306) you think about your own beliefs about  
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5308) perception about the passing of the  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5310) persons  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5311) of course um the atheist isn't going to  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5313) accept this  
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5314) but that's that's fine that's his um you  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5317) know that's his opinion  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5318) but we we've shown how belief in god can  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5321) be warranted  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5322) now that belief for me is justified in  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5325) the absence of some defeater  
[1:28:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5326) so here we shifted the burden of proof  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5328) because um  
[1:28:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5329) if i'm justified in holding this belief  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5332) then the atheist needs to show me  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5334) that my um belief is is false in some  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5337) sense  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5338) because uh you know the atheist accepts  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5340) i can believe  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5341) in the laptop in front of me with our  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5344) arguments  
[1:29:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5345) justified there's no reason to suspect  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5347) or not it can be warranted  
[1:29:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5349) same thing with god so yeah  
[1:29:19](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5359) and so yeah is an influence through  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5362) science  
[1:29:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5363) to work in the fifa does that make it  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5365) non-basically  
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5366) no it doesn't because the the immediate  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5369) belief you have  
[1:29:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5370) is triggered by yes of course using your  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5373) reason in the sense of reflection  
[1:29:35](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5375) but that's not based on other beliefs  
[1:29:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5376) that's just on pure  
[1:29:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5378) reflection and so on so um  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5382) there are a lot of questions here  
[1:29:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5385) a bit long and i really am very very  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5388) sorry  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5388) like to not answer them all i think i  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5391) might have to defer you to emailing me  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5394) um so  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5397) i'll just say for now if anybody wants  
[1:29:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5399) to email me they  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5401) can that jamie dot turner  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5414) edu dot tr  
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5418) um and anyway i'll put things on my  
[1:30:20](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5420) essays you know some content  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5422) okay i'll try and answer a couple more  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5424) though saddam  
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5425) is this just for the existence of allah  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5428) islam how do we know that our beliefs  
[1:30:29](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5429) are not  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5430) due to psychological reasons like our  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5431) families conflict i think this is a  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5433) really good question  
[1:30:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5434) um all of the questions are really good  
[1:30:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5436) on my channel but  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5437) um this is a good question because it  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5439) reminds me of something i wanted to say  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5441) um yeah so of course i've tried to show  
[1:30:44](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5444) it for the whole of islam now how does  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5446) one  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5446) not know that our beliefs are not just  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5448) the result of some psychological process  
[1:30:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5452) well that's the that's the thing it  
[1:30:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5454) seems that  
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5455) the only way one could  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5458) argue that it's just a result of  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5460) psychological reasons  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5462) is if they know god doesn't exist it  
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5464) means they have to assume that god  
[1:31:06](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5466) doesn't exist because if god exists then  
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5469) he created our faculties such that even  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5472) in you know  
[1:31:14](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5474) scenarios where maybe we feel worried we  
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5476) feel stressed  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5478) or you know etc etc even in those cases  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5482) if allah exists  
[1:31:23](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5483) then allah could make those  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5484) circumstances  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5486) reasons and means for us to come back to  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5488) believe in him  
[1:31:30](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5490) so the only way to pursue this line of  
[1:31:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5492) argument is to assume god doesn't exist  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5494) and so the atheist has to give us some  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5496) reason um  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5498) so that's the thing so that's a good  
[1:31:40](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5500) point  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5501) um and um i'm sorry  
[1:31:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5505) if the uh if the presentation was  
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5507) somewhat complex  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5508) i think my essay will clear things up  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5510) insha'allah and forgive me for the  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5512) volume if it wasn't very good  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5514) um so  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5517) yeah inshallah that that'll do for now  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5520) um  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5520) it went on a lot longer than i even  
[1:32:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5522) intended and also i will  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5525) allow you guys to email me and then you

[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5531) hope you're going to benefit from the  
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5533) remaining sessions um  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5537) again thank you everybody for tuning in  
[1:32:21](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5541) and i look forward to some fruitful  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5544) discussions with you um  
[1:32:27](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5547) via email um  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5552) just to answer one last question how do  
[1:32:33](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5553) you prove something is properly basic  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5556) and just to reiterate um you know we're  
[1:32:39](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5559) saying that something is properly basic  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5562) if it is produced by faculties  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5565) functioning properly and so on into true  
[1:32:47](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5567) we come to that belief aimed in a basic  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5569) way  
[1:32:50](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5570) and as long as we have no reason to  
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5572) suspect that it isn't like that we are  
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5574) entirely justified  
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5576) and so our belief in in um  
[1:32:59](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5579) seeing the laptop and so on or whatever  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5581) it might be  
[1:33:02](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5582) is is a properly basic belief so  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5585) my essay will be on the website within a  
[1:33:07](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5587) few days i hope insha'allah  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5589) so that's it for now and um  
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5592) take care everyone  
[1:33:26](https://youtu.be/T3Y8idsg5j4?t=5606) you
