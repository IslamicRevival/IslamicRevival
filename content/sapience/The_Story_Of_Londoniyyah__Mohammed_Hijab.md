Mohammed Hijab discusses the origins of the Londoniyyah poem and how it addresses various issues affecting Londoners. He also discusses the importance of being fair to everyone who has contributed to the Londoniyyah project, and thanks the viewers of the Sapience Institute's YouTube channel for their support.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwgCDLQ828g\&t=0)** Mohammed Hijab tells the story of how he came up with the idea to create a poem in Arabic to be named "Londoniyyah" in memory of his city of origin, London. He sent the poem to Rahim and received positive feedback from scholars. However, he was not satisfied with the poem's quality and decided to continue working on it even after his death. He eventually completed the poem and named it after his city of origin, London. The poem addresses various issues affecting Londoners, such as feminism, liberalism, materialism, and atheism.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwgCDLQ828g\&t=300)** Mohammed Hijab discusses the origins of Londoner, a poem that describes the transformation of a shy individual into an outspoken advocate for change. Eight months after the class began, he says he is very impressed with the extent to which participants have transformed themselves. He predicts that in a few years, they will all be able to facilitate similar transformations in others.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwgCDLQ828g\&t=600)** Mohammed Hijab discusses why it is important to be fair to everyone who has contributed to the Londoniyyah project, and how Carlos has been a key contributor. He also thanks the viewers of the Sapience Institute's YouTube channel for their support.

[0:00:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=0) i think i should mention something about\
[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=2) how this all started you know and why\
[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=4) this started and i think the barakah\
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=6) that could have come about because of\
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=8) the reason of how it started\
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=10) you know some some months ago maybe\
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=13) nine months ago or something like that i\
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=14) was in a hospital i'm not sure i've even\
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=16) told you the story but now i know might\
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=18) be the first time i tell you this story\
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=20) and\
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=21) i had blood clots i had something called\
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=23) pulmonary embolism in the\
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=26) lungs many of them\
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=28) and as i was in the on the hospital bed\
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=32) the doctor told me\
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=33) you might go to sleep and not wake up\
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=36) and he said you know the mortality rate\
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=38) is about 50\
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=39) for what you have\
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=40) and it's something that we can't do\
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=42) anything about because you they put you\
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=43) on blood thinners immediately but they\
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=44) said we have to we have a duty to tell\
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=46) you this and\
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=47) so obviously i started to to think about\
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=49) it\
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=51) i thought\
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=52) obviously i have to leave will behind\
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=54) and all that kind of stuff even though i\
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=55) don't have much\
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=56) things to contribute\
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=58) but i left something behind\
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=60) sorted out my will and i encourage\
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=62) everyone to do the same thing here if\
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=63) you haven't already done that you have\
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=64) to have an islamic will you know i\
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=66) encourage everyone to do that so\
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=69) i did that i had i sorted out the will\
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=72) and i said to myself well what do i what\
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=74) have i left behind\
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=76) and the hadith of the prophet muhammad\
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=78) sallam where he said\
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=82) that all of adam benny adams\
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=85) amal\
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=86) is\
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=87) ceased except for three things and the\
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=89) prophet saw he said\
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=93) a child that you leave behind that he\
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=95) supplicates for you\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=98) which is continuous\
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=101) which is a beneficial knowledge that\
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=104) you know\
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=104) that you leave behind now i couldn't\
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=106) have i was it was\
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=108) not practical for that time for me to\
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=110) have any more children\
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=112) i said\
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=112) that was something i was not planning to\
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=115) do\
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=115) and in terms of soraka tonjariya you\
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=118) know you can only leave so much behind\
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=119) that's depending on your wealth at that\
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=120) time you know i couldn't really do that\
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=122) much\
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=124) but well the the thing that i thought\
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=125) about was\
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=128) a beneficial knowledge that you leave\
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=129) behind and i thought to myself probably\
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=131) the best thing i could leave behind is\
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=132) not just debates online\
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=135) it's not just you know these informal\
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=136) things i go to speaker's corner or\
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=138) whatever it may be podcasts or whatever\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=140) i thought the best thing is what have i\
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=143) learned in all the years that i've been\
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=145) not just in the dao but preparing for it\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=148) what have i learned what have i been\
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=149) able to get from different people\
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=151) different specialists\
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=153) that i have had the pleasure and honour\
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=154) of being work being able to work with\
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=156) people like sabor ahmad who's uh he's\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=158) here today actually he's a specialist in\
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=160) in by philosophy of biology do his phd\
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=162) in it people like hamza zorsus who's\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=164) also a specialist in philosophy\
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=166) and others you know uh in terms of uh\
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=169) uh in terms of um the\
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=172) islamic studies side in the shora\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=176) other brothers that maybe don't want to\
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=177) be mentioned in the camera\
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=179) that are also here today so i thought to\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=180) myself\
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=181) i put it all\
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=182) together and\
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=184) let's make something out of here\
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=187) and uh the story was this is that in the\
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=189) beginning i thought\
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=192) this this was the plan this was the idea\
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=193) abdulrahman was there he remembers this\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=196) quite vividly i'm sure as well\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=198) the the plan was to\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=200) in in islamic history you've always had\
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=202) these kind of like\
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=203) poems for\
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=205) different funun for different sciences\
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=208) uh like el fiotic\
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=212) you know and it's usually named after\
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=214) the city that the person's in sometimes\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=215) it can be yeah sometimes his name sounds\
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=217) like a person or the fen\
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=219) but even tell me i had this idea of when\
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=221) he went to a city the the poem would be\
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=223) named after that city like a\
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=224) hammerweight\
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=227) these are actual names of seas so i\
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=229) decided to call it london a year in it\
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=231) london here so okay now in london so\
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=233) there's issues that affect us in london\
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=235) because these are the new aquila issues\
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=237) that affect us in london\
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=239) obviously then at that time it was\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=240) martezalism versus this for us it's\
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=242) feminism for us it's liberalism for us\
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=244) it's materialism it's atheism\
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=246) these are the big picture things that we\
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=248) need to focus on\
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=249) so i started constructing a poem in\
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=251) arabic language\
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=253) and obviously like you know i'm not\
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=254) really the specialist in the i'm not\
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=256) super way i'm normal you know i know\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=259) these these big poets\
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=261) and there's rules in arabic language to\
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=263) make poems it's not just you can just\
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=265) make any poem you have to it's like 16\
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=267) uh bihar or behold different or else\
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=270) then and this is very difficult so i did\
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=272) it anyway\
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=273) and i sent it to rahman i said send it\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=274) to you because you had some you know\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=277) he had some scholars and teachers that\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=279) were very good at poetry so he wouldn't\
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=281) send it to some people\
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=282) they said no this is not this is not\
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=284) that\
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=284) it does not fulfill the criterion\
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=286) so i said what do we do because you know\
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=288) this was actually when i was on the\
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=290) death bed and i said this is not going\
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=291) to realize my dream here\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=294) so sheikh al khademi\
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=296) who is a specialist in poetry and who\
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=298) actually wrote the london ear\
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=300) he he came forward and he\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=302) he kind of took out all the kind of\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=304) information that we had we had\
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=305) conversations with him\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=307) in the party and quickly just understood\
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=309) everything and put it into poetry format\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=311) it was almost a miracle\
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=313) the quickness by which he was able to\
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=315) make that transformation and able to to\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=317) do it i was very surprised and very\
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=318) impressed\
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=319) and that's how londoner came about\
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=322) so it came about i think it came about\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=324) in a time where i was actually sincere\
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=326) there's only a few times where i can\
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=327) tell you in my life that i've been\
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=328) sincere\
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=330) that i can actually tell you this\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=332) no no you know but when you're on your\
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=334) deathbed that's one of the most sincere\
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=335) places\
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=336) that you can be because you're thinking\
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=338) to yourself you know\
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=339) you're gonna die you've got to lose\
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=341) something for the people you have to\
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=342) it's for your own uh grave and for your\
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=344) own self\
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=345) and so what happened after that was what\
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=347) happened after that was you know it\
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=348) became a londoner\
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=350) and it was even ratified and very given\
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=356) from big big people like\
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=360) and other people from the like the\
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=361) rabbit islamia\
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=362) people all different kinds of i was\
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=364) interested because people from all\
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=365) different kind of critical backgrounds\
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=366) were accepting this poem\
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=369) and it's been a long time since asha has\
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=370) accepted something and others accept\
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=372) something all of them accepted this\
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=374) you know except not all of them but\
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=377) there were people from each group that\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=378) accepted this thing\
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=380) so there's a lot of kabul there was a\
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=382) lot of acceptance of this particular\
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=384) poem\
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=385) and then i said to myself well the time\
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=387) is limited i need to i need to go\
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=390) through\
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=390) an explanation of it\
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=392) so i put the proposal to hamza's sources\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=394) and you know and then it became official\
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=397) and we said it has to be an invite-only\
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=399) class\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=400) because we can't just have anyone here\
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=402) you know\
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=403) we we brought the people that we thought\
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=406) would\
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=407) would have the most effect\
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=409) in the future based on what they sent us\
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=410) and stuff like that\
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=412) and\
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=413) eight months later i have to say you\
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=415) know\
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=417) i am\
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=418) very impressed i'm surprised at the\
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=420) extent to which people can transform\
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=424) you know people coming in quite timid in\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=426) the beginning you know quiet mannered\
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=428) well you know that's good you know but\
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=430) then now you're going into discussion\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=432) with the brother\
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=433) this one especially in the back here is\
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=435) trying to hide this guy who lives in a\
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=436) village all his life\
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=437) you know this guy for example he's a\
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=439) great example of that he had the\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=440) intelligence sorry um\
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=445) as well but you might it's a great\
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=447) example of that you know and you came in\
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=449) you were a little bit you know with your\
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=451) wording and stuff like that and then\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=452) afterwards i see him on one of them he's\
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=454) going against you he's trying to cut you\
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=456) up and interject and you remember that\
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=458) one you remember that don't you\
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=460) we'll never forget that how about the\
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=462) time when uh for\
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=464) was was attacking us\
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=466) and and and playing devil's advocate and\
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=468) stuff like that we wouldn't\
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=469) expect that from the first session the\
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=470) transformation has been uh amazing how\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=473) do you agree\
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=474) you know and um\
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=476) and this is exactly the dream\
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=479) you know and another something that we\
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=480) can say is substantive that we leave\
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=481) behind and we're the first batch of\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=482) people to do it together\
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=484) i don't see myself here as being some\
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=486) kind of a teacher i'm just a facilitator\
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=487) here\
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=488) and in fact everyone has been teaching\
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=490) each other people don't realize that for\
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=492) the most part these little lectures that\
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=494) we put forward is the tip of the iceberg\
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=497) of the interactions that we have in this\
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=498) class\
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=499) and then after that we have more more\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=500) interactions and stuff like that and\
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=501) it's been\
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=502) amazing interactions where we've learned\
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=504) from each other\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=506) one thing i'll tell you never to learn\
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=507) from me is manners\
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=510) this is the wrong person you know that's\
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=511) why i never put myself in these kinds of\
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=513) positions\
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=514) i've got a long way to go you know and\
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=516) everyone knows that here so just just\
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=519) look to tariq for that please\
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=521) because i'll be honest with you\
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=523) uh since we're in this uh in the process\
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=525) of talking about uh\
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=527) things\
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=528) you know i've learned the most from from\
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=530) this this man has been unbelievably\
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=532) generous unbelievably honorable\
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=534) the most punctual the most uh\
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=537) you know i've learned more more from him\
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=539) than he's learned from me i promise you\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=540) that and i think all of us can\
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=543) can attest to this reality you know\
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=545) and so this is has been something\
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=549) you know it's been one of the most\
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=551) important projects i think i've ever\
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=552) undertook in my entire life\
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=555) you know\
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=556) and i'm very happy that we have now\
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=558) reached\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=559) the end of this series and we're going\
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=561) to go into another series which is uh\
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=563) going to be equally important and\
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=565) another series after that and after four\
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=567) or five of these series you can imagine\
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=569) with the islamic studies that we're all\
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=570) doing on the sides now\
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=572) as well where we'll be in two or three\
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=573) years we'll be in a position where we're\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=575) all rounded we'll be in a position where\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=577) we transform ourselves and i think this\
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=579) what's happening here\
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=580) it's not happening anywhere else in the\
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=582) world\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=583) not because of\
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=584) anything else but the fact that we can\
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=585) facilitate certain things that other\
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=587) people in the world cannot facilitate\
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=589) so this is a golden golden golden\
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=591) opportunity\
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=592) this is such a golden opportunity that i\
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=594) can't even imagine\
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=598) anyone would voluntarily forego it and\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=600) that's why to be fair everyone that\
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=601) started practically has ended with us\
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=604) which is a great sign a great sign that\
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=606) there's been valuation of knowledge from\
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=608) both sides\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=610) and of course i'm not going to forget\
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=612) carlos\
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=613) how could i and how could we and you\
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=615) know\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=616) he's been the most professional uh you\
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=618) know uh\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=620) he's his he's not just his editing his\
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=621) graphics but people don't realize that\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=623) this man has facilitated discussion\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=625) you know he has facilitator he's been\
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=627) himself the leader of discussions\
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=629) um he's facilitated guests his his\
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=632) contributions have been just about right\
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=635) you know not too antagonistic and not\
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=636) too passive\
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=638) and so he's been i consider him as a\
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=640) member of the team actually and i think\
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=641) all of you\
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=642) uh would agree with me and attest to\
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=644) that fact as well\
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=646) and so i want to give everyone a thank\
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=648) you from in this class and to those\
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=650) who've been watching at home because i\
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=651) know there's lots of people that i'll be\
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=652) watching at home\
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=655) who\
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=656) have also been benefiting and benefiting\
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=658) us because without them any any of this\
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=659) would not be possible anyway let's be\
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=660) honest\
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=662) the people watching at home they're the\
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/RwgCDLQ828g?t=663) lifeblood of the sapience institute
