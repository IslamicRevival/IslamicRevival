Are you or someone you know doubting Islam? Do you find yourself struggling to find answers?  Do you have a hard time speaking to someone about Islam?

Are you an activist, Imam or community leader who is unsure about how to handle questions related to science, philosophy, the Islamic moral code, etc.?

You are not alone.  Over the course of the last decade or more there has been a rapid proliferation of content online and in academic institutions that has eroded the faith of some people.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=0)** Sikhism believes in one God who is both immanent and transcendent, and they give this divine being various names including "Sargon" and "Nirgun."
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=300)* Discusses Sikhism's beliefs about worship. Sikhism believes that only one guru should be worshipped and that the mantra is the key to understanding god. This belief is similar to Islam's belief in the oneness of god.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=600)** Sikhism believes in one God, the creator of the universe, and that humans have a duty to respect and protect the world. There are no creation stories in Sikhism, unlike in other religions.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=900)** Mohammed Hijab discusses the Sikh belief that the creator, Vaheguru, is present in all aspects of the universe, including in the form of a divine spark within each human being. Sikh theology differs from Islamic theology in that Sikhism believes that God is separate from and transcendent to his creation.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=1200)** The Sikh religion takes ideas from both Hinduism and Islam, and believes that everything is God. The relationship between god and the guru is a complex one which requires further study.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=1500)** The central religious scripture of Sikhism is known as the Guru Granth Sahib, or "First Scripture." The scripture contains sacred hymns written by the ten gurus or teachers of Sikhism, as well as teachings from people of other faith groups. The gurus compiled the first rendition of the Guru Granth Sahib in 1604 and placed it in the golden temple of Amritsar. The six gurus believed that the Guru Granth Sahib is more than just a scripture; Sikhs can consider it their living guru. On special occasions, the entire Guru Granth Sahib is read in a 48-hour ceremony known as the Current Path.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=1800)** Mohammed Hijab discusses the similarities between Sikhism and Islam, pointing to the fact that many of Guru Nanak's ideas come from Islamic teachings. He also argues that because Islam credits previous dispensations, Sikhism cannot be considered a continuation of Islam.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=2100)** Mohammed Hijab discusses similarities between Sikhism and other religions, including Hinduism and Islam. He points out that Sikhism affirms the prophecies of the Prophet Muhammad, which would make it one of the "true" religions. He also mentions Sikhism's conceptions of reincarnation and death, which make it similar to other religions in the region.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=2400)** Londoniyyah discusses Sikhism and Mohammed Hijab's comparison of the two religions. Mohammed Hijab argues that Sikhism and Hinduism share many similarities, including the belief that all souls have an atma, or divine spark. He also believes that Sikhism and Hinduism are similar in their stance on reincarnation, and that the higher being on earth is the human being. Lastly, Londoniyyah discusses the issue of fatalism and the idea that the actions of a disabled person have consequences for their entire life, even if they don't live long enough to see them.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=2700)** Sikhism has rituals associated with baptism, including the drinking of a holy beverage and singing of hymns. Five symbols of Sikh faith are worn on the body. The founder of Sikhism, Guru Gobind Singh, is said to have appeared in a physical form as the last guru.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=3000)** The Sikh religion is based on the belief that there are ten gurus who have brought humankind salvation. The final guru, Guru Gobind Singh, created the theology. Sikhism is largely pacifistic, but they had a close relationship with the Moguls until they were expelled in the 1800s.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=3300)* Discusses the Sikh religion and its relationship to the Mughal Empire. It discusses the ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, who is said to have been split in the middle and brought back to life. He is then persecuted by the Mughals. Some Sikhs revere him as a martyr, while others view him as a loser for his involvement in military expeditions against the empire. This hostility towards Muslim communities is still alive in modern times.

 covers the basics of Sikhism, including their beliefs in scripture and reincarnation, as well as their practices of prayer and giving to the gurdwara. Mohammed Hijab finishes with a message to Sikhs to seek the truth and be liberated from its power.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=3600)** The Sikh religion is based on the principle of one supreme being, the eternal reality, and the teachings of the gurus. Sikh rituals are broken up into smaller parts in order to emphasize the importance of each individual moment. The five ks, or five articles of clothing worn by Sikhs, are also a reminder of the importance of humility and defense of the weak.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j44ib_wGBE&t=3900)** Mohammed Hijab discusses the basics of Sikhism, including their basic statement of belief in scripture as being God, and their practices of prayer and giving to the gurdwara.

[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=8) welcome to another  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=10) episode where we're going to be talking  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=11) insha'allah about  
[0:00:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=14) sikhism which is one of the largest  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=16) world religions and a religion which is  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=18) an indic religion one that is also  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=22) in the concentrate or the demography of  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=24) sikhs are concentrated in this  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=26) subcontinent  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=27) and obviously it leads off quite well  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=30) from the discussion that we had before  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=32) about hinduism which is also  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=34) an indic religion but in fact this is uh  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=38) well the first ever if you like hindi  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=40) indic religion  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=42) in many ways some have said that sikhism  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=46) has many things in common with  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=49) hinduism a lot of that we will cover  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=52) today and this  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=53) lesson is going to or you should say  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=55) session  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=56) cover the same kind of structure  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=59) as the one before  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=62) namely we will leave it to the  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=64) participants to do  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=66) the majority of the talking  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=68) because i think after all of these  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=70) sessions you and they and we have all  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=74) had enough  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=75) of my  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=77) voice  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=78) and of course i haven't  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=80) but that is something for another day so  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=83) we're going to speak firstly about  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=85) probably the most important thing  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=86) uh about  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=88) arguably the most important thing about  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=90) any religion which is  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=92) the conception of god or the sikh  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=94) conception  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=96) of god  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=96) you're going to start us off  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=98) with that so let me ask you what is the  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=101) sikh conception of god  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=104) so this is conception of god  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=106) very similar to the islamic conception  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=108) okay i would say  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=110) in terms of theology is very much the  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=113) same  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=115) they believe in one god they believe in  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=116) the oneness of  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=118) of god  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=121) the name they use most widely to to call  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=124) god is  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=126) waheguru  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=130) which means one draws one the rose and  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=133) lighter  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=135) and  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=136) like i said they believe in one god who  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=138) created everything  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=140) and they believe  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=142) which is good uh  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=144) is is in  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=146) in our minds all the time or must remain  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=148) in our minds it needs to be in our minds  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=150) all the time that's the way of  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=151) of kind of um praying or or  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=155) you know  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=156) basically  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=159) worshiping god  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=164) so  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=165) this different ways they can describe  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=175) okay so let's take it one by one satnam  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=178) means what a true name true name okay  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=182) yes  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=185) which  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=186) literally means which means one yes in  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=189) in punjabi or and uh on car uh god so  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=193) there's one only one quote  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=196) uh which is like eternal being  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=200) and then  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=201) uh similar to islam  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=202) they they give this white guru it's  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=205) called  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=206) attributes  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=207) and they call it the creator  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=210) which is like the act of creating  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=212) everything  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=213) um hookum they call hookum the act of  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=216) creating everything  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=218) uh ineffable which is uh  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=221) uh the essence cannot be as they could  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=223) adequately describe in in what  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=227) is god is genderless  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=230) so waheguru is neither male or female  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=234) self-revealing unnecessary does not  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=238) does not need uh so god is safe for  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=240) building unnecessary so it does not need  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=242) the  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=243) uh creator  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=245) uh  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=246) guru is sargon which means  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=248) a human imminent  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=251) or within the world in the world and  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=254) therefore able to have a personal  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=255) relationship with the creation  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=258) at the same time  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=259) guru is nirgun which is transcendent  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=263) or beyond creation or and therefore  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=267) unaffected by the war  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=269) does that make sense yeah okay it's also  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=272) eternal what grows outside the time and  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=274) space and beyond the circles of birth  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=276) and death  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=277) so basically uh  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=279) humans  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=280) they burn and they die  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=282) and they born again until they go out of  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=284) the cycle by  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=287) remembering  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=289) god  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=290) present in our creation in form of  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=292) divine spark  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=294) this is the part of wahaguru that is  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=296) within all beings and it is the soul of  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=299) of a being basically  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=301) uh  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=302) rebelled it was revealed by the grace of  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=305) uh of the guru this is the belief that  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=307) guru can be known through understanding  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=310) and learning  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=311) what each other of the 10 gurus  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=313) contributed contributed to secretion  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=318) and no no but to all so he knows  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=320) everything and where guru is no but to  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=322) anyone who dedicates his  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=324) his or her life  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=326) to learning and understanding god  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=334) so yeah i believe that only one guru  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=336) must be worshipped no know what no one  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=339) is  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=340) should be worshipped  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=344) and i think on this point  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=346) uh

[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=348) forget where you are just  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=350) the key definitions okay so definitions  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=353) of worship  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=355) as muslims we have  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=357) our own definitions of worship we have  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=359) our own understandings and conceptions  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=361) of worship of course for sikhs sikhs  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=364) have their own definitions of worship  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=365) their own conceptions of worship  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=367) so in order for us to see okay who are  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=370) you worshipping  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=371) whose conception are we looking are we  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=372) looking at the sikh conception we're  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=373) looking at muslim conception so i think  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=375) at this point it's very good continue  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=376) but what i want to  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=378) caveat in here is that this is from a  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=381) sikh perspective  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=384) so  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=385) like i said they  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=387) they  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=388) only worship  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=389) or they must worship only by guru which  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=391) is good  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=393) it is for forbidden to worship any image  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=396) of a guru similar to islam  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=399) and  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=399) but they do have images of the of the  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=401) gurus of the 10 gurus  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=404) a phone  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=405) you can find the finder in the good  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=407) waters or the temples  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=412) the mantra  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=414) so the 66 believe that  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=416) guru nature is expressed in the mantra  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=419) which is part of the  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=421) of the like the holy book  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=423) and so can you expand this  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=425) say this one more time so the mantra is  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=428) the sixth statement of belief is like  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=430) our tahit  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=434) it is the basis of the whole sikhism and  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=437) contains the key of a key belief about  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=439) ohaguru and so what do you know what the  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=442) the phrases they say are  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=447) not really  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=448) i mean uh  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=453) the moon mantra is the most important  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=454) composition of this of secretion  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=457) which is reflected in the fact that  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=459) it is the opening lines of guru granth  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=462) sahib which  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=472) and the first line of the moon mantra  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=476) therefore the guru granth sahib  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=478) it starts with  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=479) ankara which is  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=481) one god although there is only one god  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=484) and this symbolizes the importance of of  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=487) the belief in the oneness of god and the  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=489) oneness of the  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=490) humanity they believe that everyone is  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=493) equal  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=494) so basically the book starts by saying  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=496) that this one god  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=498) um  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=499) this important interestingly obviously  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=501) sikhism is a very modern religion  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=503) i think this should be trust as well  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=505) comp comparative to other religions like  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=507) hinduism  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=509) and  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=510) islam of judaism and christianity all  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=512) these religions existed thousands of  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=513) years ago in the case of islam as a  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=515) medieval religion in the case of  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=517) in the time of antiquity and hinduism  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=520) even before that so  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=521) obviously we believe islam has always  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=522) been there from our narrative but it's  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=524) important to note that some things you  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=527) may  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=528) feel or  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=530) uh think have a modern feel and sense  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=534) but don't forget this this religion is  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=536) quite modern itself  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=537) you know it existed at the same time  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=539) where a lot of the  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=540) enlightenment ideas had been in  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=543) formulation  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=544) and and indians had been in connection  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=546) with had had connection with the western  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=548) world and they'd know no other ideas so  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=550) just  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=551) keep going yeah like i mentioned at the  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=553) beginning there's a lot of similarities  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=555) to islam in terms of theology yes maybe  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=559) other things are more similar to  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=561) hinduism  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=562) but theology is pretty much  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=564) right but his  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=566) word is important  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=568) because there are some attributes of god  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=570) and the way they describe  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=573) god  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=575) relative to the gurus  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=577) guru nanak in particular  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=579) which would be incompatible with the  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=581) islamic theology  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=582) um how they describe him as like a drop  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=584) in the in the ocean and then god is like  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=587) the ocean and and the guru nanak is like  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=589) at the drop you see so it's almost and  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=592) what i mean by that is it's almost like  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=594) an interconnectedness  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=596) with the guru and god of this this kind  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=599) of thing would be out of line with the  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=601) islamic theology yeah i would say is  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=605) one chance is um  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=606) so the theology  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=608) is if it's part of  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=610) what islam believes yes but it's not all  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=613) of yeah so there's  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=615) so there are lots of continuities it's a  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=618) lot of overlap in the sense that they  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=619) talk about god and eternal uh he's  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=622) eternal the pre-eternal person  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=624) and the creator of everything all these  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=626) things are clearly um  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=628) you know continuities with the islamic  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=630) religion yeah yeah so the world man  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=633) tries like i say is part of the six  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=635) daily prayers  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=636) it is taught  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=639) to young six children and a form of this  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=642) is from it forms the basic  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=645) the basis of  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=646) sick belief  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=648) some of the you are you're asking  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=651) what would you use yeah so some of the  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=653) worst  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=654) words they use in the moral mantra is uh  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=657) like i said it's  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=658) called the more mantra yeah more  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=659) manchester more more more more  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=663) small yeah  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=666) mantra yeah okay  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=668) i don't really know how they pronounce  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=669) it but yeah  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=670) that's already  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=671) so it conquered like as i mentioned  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=673) before there's only one god  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=675) uh  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=676) you know in phraseology it's quite  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=678) similar to  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=679) allah right yes yes okay um

[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=720) right in a sense  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=722) [Music]  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=728) uh set assistant

[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=734) it's like  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=735) what we say um  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=739) yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good point  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=742) all right is that all you got all um  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=746) i mean i can go on yeah  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=750) we also believe that  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=751) guru created the universe like i  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=752) mentioned  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=753) in the world and everything every life  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=757) platforms within  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=759) six believed that before the universe  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=760) existed there was only one guru  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=763) and  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=764) it was because of  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=766) of his will or  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=768) the will of god  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=770) meaning hukum in  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=772) punjabi that the universe was created  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=776) they believe in the oneness of creation  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=778) that  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=779) guru created the world and his part  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=782) and is part of this creation  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=784) he sustains the world and he's  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=786) responsible for everything we need in it  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=789) therefore sikhs believe that they have a  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=791) duty to respect and protect the world  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=796) there are no creation stories in sikhism  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=798) unlike in in other other religions such  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=801) as  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=802) christianity or hinduism  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=805) for example  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=807) christianity teaches adam and eve  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=811) but for sikhs  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=813) because they believe  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=815) the guru granth sahib so the book  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=817) is more focused on the nature of  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=819) vaheguru of god  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=822) they don't really care if  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=824) they would take the  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=826) big bang theory as the  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=829) basis of existence so they don't really  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=831) have  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=832) but i think it's important to note here  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=833) as well  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=835) that the guru grant sahib does actually  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=836) make  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=838) does actually make points about nature  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=840) very famously i think it and  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=843) i think this is where it says that  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=844) there's a certain amount of species  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=847) in the world  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=849) i'm not sure how many it says but it  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=851) does actually give a number  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=855) there's something about this is more in  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=856) the reincarnation thing how this this  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=859) thing of like there's 8.4 million  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=861) different reincarnations that you can  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=862) have yes so they count the human being  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=865) as one of that 8.4 million which  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=867) indicates that there's  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=868) that many species as well i guess  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=870) that'll be the implication yeah so it's  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=872) so some because you've got to remember  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=874) that a lot when you're reading this  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=875) information it's coming from sources  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=877) which are seek themselves and so they  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=879) want to present it as if it has no  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=881) connection with  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=883) the natural world because it acts as a  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=885) doubt to a lot of their their followers  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=889) when they say okay it's got 8.4 million  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=892) species one of the implications  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=894) in that case what we'll have to do is  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=896) find nine million and then in which case  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=898) you have you know maybe a contradiction  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=900) here depends on how it depending on how  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=902) we describe a species and there can be a  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=904) discussion i'm not saying this is a way  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=906) to disprove a book or it's not whatever  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=908) but what i am saying is it's not a book  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=911) which seems to be deplete from making  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=914) naturalistic references  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=916) it does make naturalistic references  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=918) maybe not elaborative uh  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=921) ones or stories of narratives  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=924) but it does make naturalistic references  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=926) yeah keep going  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=928) so i'm going to read part of the  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=930) the guru granth sahib and  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=933) um so about the creation and yes  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=936) so he established he established the  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=938) earth the sky and the air and the water  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=942) of the oceans fire and food  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=944) he created the moon the stars and the  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=946) sun  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=947) night and day and mountains he blessed  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=950) the trees and flowers with  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=952) three blessed trees with flowers and  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=954) fruits he created the gods human beings  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=957) and the seven seas he established the  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=959) three world world  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=962) wars sorry  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=967) the six also believe that guru is nergon  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=970) like i mentioned before is transcendent  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=973) genderless uh  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=975) is  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=977) in in fable in the future  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=980) no no  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=981) like a  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=982) you cannot be put into words  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=985) [Music]  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=986) is beyond any human explanation  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=990) so they use  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=992) that's why they use  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=994) many different names to to get a better  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=997) understanding of  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=998) nature  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1008) so uh  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1012) so they also believe that uh  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1015) vaheguru is sargon imminent  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1018) and so everything in the universe has a  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1020) vaheguru's presence in it  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1023) this means that our gurukus  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1025) for his creation and this is this is the  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1027) point this is this is a point of  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1029) difference between them and islam  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1031) because  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1033) pretty much all the credible schools of  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1035) thought with the exception of very few  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1037) don't believe that god is mixed in with  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1040) in essence with his creation  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1042) that he's  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1044) this is the phrase that the  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1046) you know the companions of the price  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1048) predecessors used to use which is that  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1050) he's distinguished from the creation  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1055) but  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1056) clearly this is this omni this physical  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1058) omni  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1059) uh  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1060) presence  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1061) of god  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1063) call it physical but you know this  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1065) uh  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1066) essential omnipresence of god is  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1069) something which  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1071) is a clear  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1072) this you know differentiator the islamic  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1075) theology and the sikh theology yeah  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1079) so yeah they believe  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1081) he cares about his creation and  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1084) everything in it  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1085) everything that changed and happens in  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1087) the world is because of  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1089) hukum uh  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1090) will basically yeah  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1106) it enables him to reveal himself to  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1108) human beings yeah um  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1111) so the they believe he was part of them  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1113) in the form of like divine spark yes  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1118) in guru granth sahib 290 says he  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1121) possesses all the qualities he's  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1122) transcendent to all qualities perfect

[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1276) the with the guru is like no  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1279) he's doing the scriptures  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1281) so who who were the authors and that  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1283) stuff

[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1298) brother yeah okay look uh we just just  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1300) to fill you in so this is your turn to  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1302) speak ahmed  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1304) uh or just just to fill you in bro uh we  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1307) have just spoken about  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1309) the sikh conception of god what are your  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1312) contributions on this front what are the  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1314) similarities and differences between the  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1315) sikh conception of god  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1317) and the islamic one  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1322) okay  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1326) yes so  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1328) sikhism is a is a religion which a lot  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1331) of people say takes ideas from both  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1333) hinduism and islam  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1335) that it takes the idea of monotheism  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1338) from islam but it also takes the idea of  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1341) pantheism from hinduism so sikhs  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1344) sikhism generally they believe that um  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1347) everything is god  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1349) um that the laptop is god um  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1352) but there's also an argument that some  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1354) sikh scholars make some of the educated  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1357) sikh scholars their philosophers  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1360) who try to argue  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1361) somewhat of a similar idea  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1363) as hinduism in that there is one god  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1366) but that in every moment that god is  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1370) creating he is sustaining things so  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1372) um they argue that the uneducated sikhs  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1376) believe that god is in everything but in  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1379) reality it's just that god is sustaining  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1382) everything so um like el biruni what we  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1385) mentioned last week how he made the  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1387) distinction  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1388) between how the educated people view god  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1390) in a religion and the uneducated  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1393) there is an argument that one can make  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1395) that the educated sikhs believe that  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1397) there is one being  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1399) who is kind of responsible for  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1401) everything  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1402) maintaining everything  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1404) and that the uneducated people just  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1406) because they cannot conceptualize what  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1408) that actually means  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1409) they believe that god is actually in  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1412) everything so um i i think that's an  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1415) important point that uh  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1417) that maybe we might need to look into a  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1419) bit more  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1420) what's the relationship between god and  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1422) the guru  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1424) um because there have been analogies  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1425) that have been made  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1427) um to the to the  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1430) that go along the lines of that this the  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1433) guru nanak is like a drop in the ocean  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1436) and the ocean is a god  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1439) so what is the relationship between god  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1440) and guru nanak  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1442) it it's a complicated one which um i  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1446) would need to study a bit more but  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1448) um  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1449) some people argue that it's really i  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1451) think guru gobind singh the last guru  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1454) who really creates the theology of the  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1456) religion who's the one who's most  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1458) responsible  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1459) um  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1460) because i know that  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1461) i'm not sure how how strong the argument  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1464) is but some do argue that guru nanak was  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1466) a muslim and that he held orthodox  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1469) beliefs  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1470) but the relationship between the gurus  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1472) and god is one i think that needs to be  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1474) explored a bit more and i think that the  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1477) the common narrative  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1478) that's been pre that's been created that  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1481) the gurus are are the gods and stuff um  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1483) i i don't buy that at all and i think  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1486) we need to do a bit more research on  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1488) that okay  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1489) uh the next thing we want to discuss was  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1492) uh scriptures right  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1493) so if we could just have the  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1496) presentation from the  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1497) tarq and inshallah we can then have your  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1501) opinion ahmed okay  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1503) okay  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1505) you'll be able to hear what's been said  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1507) sure  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1508) the the central religious scripture of  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1510) the sikh religion is known as  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1513) the adi grant or first scripture it is  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1516) more  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1517) more commonly known as the guru granth  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1520) sahib  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1521) i'll be referring to it as the ggs  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1524) the scripture contains sacred hymns  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1526) written by the ten gurus or teachers of  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1529) sikhism  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1530) as well as teachings from people of  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1532) other faith groups  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1533) the ggs contains 5867  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1537) sacred hymns or shah bats  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1542) its first rendition was compiled by guru  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1546) arjun and completed in 1604  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1549) and placed in the golden temple of  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1551) amritsar  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1553) the six believed that the ggs is more  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1556) than just a scripture  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1558) sikhs can consider the ggs to be a  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1560) living guru and their current and  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1563) perpetual master  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1565) when six are in the presence of the ggs  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1567) they must behave in a respectful manner  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1570) and remove their shoes and women must  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1574) cover their heads  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1575) all must refrain from raucous behavior  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1578) while in the presence of the ggs  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1582) the text of the ggs is written in  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1584) gurmukhi a dialect of the punjabi  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1587) language  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1590) the words of the hymns or shahbaz are  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1592) called gurbani which translates as words  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1596) of the gurus  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1598) at the beginning of every section of the  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1600) ggs there is a declaration called the  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1603) mool mantar  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1604) this  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1605) recitation proclaims that  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1608) there is only one god who is the creator  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1610) he is without fear and without hate  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1613) he is immortal and without form  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1616) he can be reached through the mercy and  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1618) grace of the guru  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1621) this small mantra is believed to be the  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1623) first revelation given to the guru nanak  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1627) copies of the ggs are kept in the  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1629) gurdwara of this or sikh temple  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1633) at the end of each day the copy of the  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1635) ggs is taken to an elaborate  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1638) in an in an elaborate procession  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1640) uh to a special room where it is laid on  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1643) a bed to rest for the night  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1648) on special occasions the entire ggs is  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1651) red in its entirety allowed and this  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1655) takes approximately 48 hours of  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1657) recitation this this is known as the  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1660) current path  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1662) beautiful thanks so much  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1664) can you tell us more about the ggs and  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1666) can you tell us more about how they  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1668) understand it in divine terms if if that  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1670) is indeed how they understand it  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1674) yeah so just um just a couple of  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1676) thoughts i want to share about the text  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1679) you know the text begins you know the  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1680) beginning of the guru granth sahib  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1682) starts by by describing god it says that  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1685) god you know the one supreme being  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1687) truth is his name the creator primal  
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1690) being without fear and without enmity  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1693) the timeless verity unincarnated in  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1695) self-existence known through his grace  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1699) um  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1700) so when you read through portions of the  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1702) buddhism guru granth sahib you see a lot  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1705) of these verses about monotheism the  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1707) idea that god is not created that he is  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1710) omnipotent and infinite and i think  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1713) again  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1714) we're dealing with a situation very  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1716) similar with hinduism where the earliest  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1719) texts themselves are very clear that  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1722) it's referring to this monotheistic  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1724) being  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1725) but it's only later with the addition of  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1727) new with new additions with for example  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1730) with guru granth uh guru gobind singh  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1733) the last guru  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1734) and i think with many of their scholars  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1736) and stuff are these ideas of pantheism  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1739) being associated with it the idea is  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1741) that the gurus themselves are god or  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1744) that the scripture itself is a  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1746) manifestation of god i think these  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1749) things they don't necessarily align with  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1751) what the earliest versions of the text  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1753) are saying and i think if we had to  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1755) choose between the two i think  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1757) ultimately we'd choose the text so  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1760) um i think if we if we spend a little  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1762) bit time going through the text itself  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1765) um we can see that you know it appears  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1768) to indicate you know a form of  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1769) monotheism and not a form of pantheism  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1772) or pananthism the only issue here is  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1775) when we're talking about when we talked  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1776) about the strategy with hindus  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1779) talking about the text  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1781) made a little bit of sense because  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1782) talking about the text is okay this was  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1784) before the quran which is the final  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1785) revelation  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1786) here speaking about the scripture makes  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1789) no sense whatsoever because  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1791) we believe this is a fabrication 100  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1794) because it has come after the quran and  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1795) the quran has claimed to be the final  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1797) revelation  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1798) and so yeah  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1800) and so and so the the strategy of using  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1803) you know the the ggs as i say look this  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1805) is what it says in your book  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1807) i feel like we should completely not use  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1809) that strategy because it will be  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1811) legitimizing this book which we believe  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1813) is i agree yeah i agree but one of the  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1816) things i think we should mention i think  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1818) would be interesting is going back to  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1820) this point that perhaps guru nanak um  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1824) looking into the reasons was guru nanak  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1826) i mean you know something which is quite  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1827) fascinating is that  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1830) if you can read this in the book uh the  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1831) sikh faith uh it's called  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1834) the seek faith a universal message  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1836) uh i i read it so are you talking yes  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1838) sir okay  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1841) and he talked about how guru nanak you  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1842) know studied in the madrasa  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1844) you know he sat with some of the man he  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1847) was studying and he was familiar with  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1850) islamic teachings  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1854) i have it right here  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1856) the seek faith a universal message  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1859) by gore  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1861) singh g u r  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1866) so just to be clear what you're saying  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1868) is saying before he  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1870) formed his own religion obviously not a  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1872) muslim anymore famously said no hinduism  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1875) no islam or  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1876) right before that happened before that  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1878) happened he was you're saying that there  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1880) could be a claim that an argument could  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1882) be made a historical argument that he  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1883) was  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1884) if not a muslim he was influenced by  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1886) islamic teachings quite strongly in his  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1888) uh place  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1890) of residence  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1891) yeah definitely and um i actually have  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1893) the page number here it's page 21.  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1896) um if anybody's interested in trying to  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1898) open up the book but it's one of the  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1900) arguments um you know i live in a city  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1903) where  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1905) percent of the people here are sick  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1907) and in my neighborhood specifically i  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1909) think it's close to eighty percent so um  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1912) you know i'm always conversing with the  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1913) sikhs and they have a very good idea  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1916) about islam and the reason why is  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1918) because guru nanak was very familiar  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1920) right they they have the story and their  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1922) tradition that guru nanak what what city  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1925) is that by the way  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1926) sixty percent of the people are sick  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1929) so it's uh yeah in vancouver because my  
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1932) family lives in vancouver i moved to  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1933) berkeley but in vancouver there's a city  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1936) called surrey uh which is very similar  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1938) to brampton in toronto so  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1941) um  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1942) yeah so so my whole neighborhood is  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1944) familiar with this but um there's this  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1947) contention that some people mentioned  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1949) that guru nanak actually went to umrah  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1951) that he went to mecca i think that claim  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1954) uh is unsubstantive i don't really think  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1956) we have evidence for it but the  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1958) relationship between guru nanak and  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1960) islam and how some could make the  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1962) argument that guru nanak was actually a  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1964) muslim but then later  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1966) sikhs and stuff came and they kind of  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1968) took his ideas and created a new  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1970) religion because look many of his ideas  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1972) for example of growing the beard and  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1974) stuff really come from islam and so  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1977) uh  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1978) islam has a huge influence on sikhism  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1980) and the re one reason being specifically  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1982) that guru nanak studied  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1985) and he was with muslims and his i  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1987) believe his chief  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1989) his servant or whoever traveled with him  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1991) everywhere was also a muslim as well i  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1993) think what's important to also outline  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1996) here is the fact that because some will  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1998) say  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=1998) using a tuku  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2000) type reasoning  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2001) that well look at islam and how  
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2003) connected it is with the judaic  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2006) christian tradition how how many  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2007) continuities and overlaps  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2009) can be made or between those religions  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2013) and we i think if we're going down that  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2015) route of saying that it was a  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2017) amalgamate  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2019) you know amalgam of uh  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2021) uh of of islam and hinduism  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2025) clearly we can make that argument but we  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2026) have to make the distinction here that  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2028) islam  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2029) gives credit  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2031) to the previous dispensations it says  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2033) that there were  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2034) previous dispensations they were you  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2036) know that were people that were revealed  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2038) uh god revealed it to them and then the  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2040) so there was there's a narrative which  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2042) is consistent  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2044) with the previous dispensations whereas  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2046) we're here  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2047) you're not seeing the same thing you're  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2049) seeing basically  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2050) uh there isn't credit given to the  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2052) prophet muhammad as the final prophet  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2054) which is our narrative because obviously  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2055) they believe that he was the final  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2057) prophet and what he was speaking was  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2058) truth  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2059) that they couldn't be sikhs by  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2061) definition  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2062) and so you've cancelled out the fact  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2063) that this could be from god  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2066) and that what he was saying was true  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2068) because he said he's a final prophet  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2070) but then  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2072) it's how is it so common coincidental  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2075) that all of many of your rituals many of  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2076) your  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2078) many of the things the phrases in your  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2079) book  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2081) are just in line with the quran and  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2082) sunnah  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2084) your theological conceptions  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2086) how you just define god or so much of  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2088) them are in line with the quran  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2090) even the 5ks  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2092) a lot of them  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2093) even the hymns the fact that you chant  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2095) your even the way you deal with your  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2097) book  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2098) all of those things are in line  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2101) there are similarities there  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2103) i i completely agree with you and i  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2105) think that's one difficulty we have with  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2107) sikhism is this idea that it emerged  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2110) after islam and since we know that so  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2114) in a sense we can't affirm you know the  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2116) validity of their scripture and stuff  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2118) um  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2119) one thing i do want to mention just from  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2120) this book i just want to read the short  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2122) quote that i think  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2124) is quite interesting  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2125) is that it says it says quote  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2128) he studied both in the hindu temples and  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2130) also in the muslim madrasas after he had  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2134) this is referring to guru nanak yes  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2135) after he had read the scriptures of  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2137) these religions  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2138) guru nanak felt that there could not be  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2140) two separate gods  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2142) one for the hindus and one for the  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2144) muslims as claimed by the people  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2147) he declared that there is only one god  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2149) for all of humanity who loved people  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2152) irrespective of whatever names they gave  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2154) to their faith  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2156) and so we can love him by any name  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2159) so  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2160) i think the interesting point to mention  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2162) here is that guru nanak himself it seems  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2165) had you know he affirmed kind of the  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2167) prophecy of the prophet sallallahu  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2169) alaihi  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2170) you know he might have had some  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2171) perennial views in some sort but he he  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2174) did affirm the prophecy of the prophet  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2177) and so i think um in our dawah that  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2179) that's why so what's the most explicit  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2181) thing what's the most explicit thing  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2183) where he affirms the prophecy of the  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2184) prophet muhammad  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2186) that you know um  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2188) i don't have a specific but do you know  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2190) at least what do you know at least in  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2192) what context that he affirms the  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2194) prophecy of the prophet muhammad because  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2196) if he does affirm it then one of the  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2198) things that prophet muhammad said is  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2199) that he's a final prophet right and that  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2201) the quran is the final revelation so how  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2203) does he deal with that conundrum  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2206) that's something  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2207) this book it seems i i don't i don't  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2210) think it delves too deep into it so it  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2212) would require a little bit more research  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2214) and figuring out  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2215) what and figuring out what exactly his  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2218) his view on because i do believe he  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2220) believed the prophet sallam was divine  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2222) he was a prophet but um  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2224) did that necessarily mean that this that  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2226) he had to follow the sharia of the  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2228) prophet that the prophet but it's not  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2230) just  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2232) not just yeah exactly so  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2233) yeah  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2234) if he was a true prophet then all of the  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2236) narratives relating to his infallibility  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2238) that he's a true prophet that speaks on  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2239) behalf of god would be true and in which  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2241) case you know he would have no claim to  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2244) revelation from god  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2246) which is what he did claim when he went  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2247) into the sea or  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2248) when he came back in the famous story  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2251) all right let's move on to the next part  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2253) let's let's delve a little bit deeper  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2256) into their  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2257) eschatological conceptions and  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2259) reincarnation  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2260) what have you found with that  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2263) yeah so  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2264) once again in this area there rings a  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2266) lot of similarities with uh with  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2268) hinduism discussed in the previous  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2269) session  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2271) um they have a similar idea of  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2272) reincarnation they use the same term the  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2274) cycle of samsara the life cycle the idea  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2277) that you die and you and you're reborn  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2279) into a new body and you die you're  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2281) reborn into a new  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2282) body they also believe that there's a  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2285) sort of relationship between the souls  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2287) so those souls that were together in the  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2289) previous life are together in the next  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2291) life um and for polemical reasons they  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2293) will use this as sort of  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2295) as an argument too from their standpoint  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2297) anyways to answer is death the odyssey  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2299) so that's how they deal with the problem  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2300) of evil as well and so as far as  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2302) engagements that's like a  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2304) something to keep an eye on on this  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2305) point i just want to kind of add just  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2308) think of the likelihood that a religion  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2310) that claims to be real from god  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2312) has the exact  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2314) uh conceptions  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2317) of the two major religion that exists in  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2319) this province  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2321) hinduism islam  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2322) why those two in particular like  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2324) hinduism in islam why not judaism  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2327) why not  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2330) african tribal religion okay a mayan  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2333) civilizational religion uh babylonian  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2335) religion why why are  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2337) why is it not an amalgam of those things  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2340) it's very clearly a joke you can see  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2342) here what's going on  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2344) he's he's making choices uh nanakis of  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2348) what what to include in his religion was  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2349) not  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2350) oh this is from hinduism it sounds nice  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2352) he prefers that to the hell heaven and  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2353) hell conception um you know the uh this  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2357) one's uh this one is uh sounds more  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2359) coherent maybe to him  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2361) uh the one god thesis  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2364) let's mix that up a little bit you know  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2366) it's clearly i mean it can't be  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2369) that both of these only these two  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2372) are the ones that are true  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2374) only these two forget about the rest of  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2376) the world civilizations right we are the  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2378) africans and the mayans and the  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2379) europeans and the scandinavians and the  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2381) vikings forget about all those it has to  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2383) be just the ones in india very indian  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2385) specific context here punjab  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2388) specific concept yeah  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2389) yes yep  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2391) um well i i think going back to it the  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2393) reason why you probably believe in this  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2395) is because he only studied in a madras  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2398) in a hindu temple so  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2400) i think that i don't think he had a  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2402) knowledge of comparative religion just  
[0:40:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2404) these two because he studied them  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2406) formally and he just tried to synthesize  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2409) the two so that i think that's why yeah  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2410) yeah  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2411) continue please yeah just  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2413) so i would also concur that i think it's  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2415) quite clear that he basically  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2417) just merged together the things that he  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2418) had at his disposal but the similarities  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2420) don't stop there because they also  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2421) believe in similar to the hindus that  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2423) they believe all souls have what they  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2424) call an atma which is  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2426) it's called an atoma yeah which is a  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2428) divine spark which is a term that some  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2430) people use now as well  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2433) so they believe that this is this divine  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2435) spark is a part of the the wahi guru  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2439) so this is also like what's that the  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2442) that's the god right so it's a divine  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2444) spark within every single person right  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2446) and that's what goes in it dies and it  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2448) comes back and all that type of thing  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2450) but  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2450) guru nanak he spoke about that divine  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2452) spark and used it to argue for  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2455) you know uh at least this house seeks to  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2456) present it oneness of humanity you know  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2459) this is the the ideal that everybody can  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2461) get to god you know his famous statement  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2462) about you know there's no hindu there's  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2463) no muslim there's just you know i'm just  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2465) on my path to god kind of thing so from  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2467) that standpoint it  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2468) almost appears very liberal um but you  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2471) do have that idea so that's what dies  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2472) and lives on and that type of thing so  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2475) uh  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2477) the body that the atom is born into is  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2479) determined by the karma  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2481) from the previous life which is another  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2482) similarity with hinduism  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2484) the highest possible being on earth is  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2486) the human being  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2487) and then you've got this 8.4 million  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2490) other ones that you could that you can  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2492) sort of incarnate into so there's a  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2493) question about what those species are  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2496) and what and what that's that's i'm not  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2498) sure how sikhs will explain right  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2499) because now are we excluding bacteria  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2502) you know what is included and what is  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2504) not included in 8.4 million because  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2507) and and how was the categorization is it  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2508) species we talked about kinds or we're  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2510) talking about animal where  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2511) uh living forms so we're talking about  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2513) you know  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2515) so and if we are then it's gonna be more  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2517) than 8.4  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2519) depends on how you categorize or  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2520) classify it but yeah yeah so um  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2524) so they'll say that you know if you're a  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2525) human being that gives absorb an extra a  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2528) kick to your life let's say you've got  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2529) lucky so if you're a human being and  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2531) it's likely that whatever you were doing  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2533) in your previous life you did something  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2534) right because you've managed to make it  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2535) to the highest level because obviously  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2536) the probabilities so so we have the same  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2538) issues now with reincarnation if you're  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2540) an ant how do you be good at a good ant  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2542) yeah cockroach how you become a good  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2544) cockroach or a rat how do you become a  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2546) good rat yeah i i read i read something  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2548) um i lift up if the brother can confirm  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2550) this but that they actually don't  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2552) attribute it's the problem is actually a  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2553) bit harder for them because they  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2554) explicitly don't attribute moral agency  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2556) to animals all right yes yeah which is  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2558) even worse how do you become how did you  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2560) graduate from uh being an aunt  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2562) to being maybe i don't know grasshopper  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2564) or something yes i mean you know  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2566) it's i don't know which one of those is  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2568) worse but  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2569) maybe the ant is more i would say it's  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2570) more and that was very high level  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2572) actually yeah fast wars yeah it takes  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2575) yeah  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2576) once again what's the criteria of  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2578) superiority  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2581) because because if i was if i was a  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2583) if i was an ant and there was you know  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2586) lots of people were  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2588) going to stamp on me  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2589) i wouldn't want to be them  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2593) you know  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2594) but if i was  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2595) you know but it's true but if i was a  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2598) dog  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2599) but i was you know one of the top dogs  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2601) i'd want to be a top dog you know a lion  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2604) if a lion had no food once again it goes  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2605) back to the issues  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2606) an impoverished animal of a high what  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2609) about if you're a disabled human being  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2612) and then you have the issues of fatalism  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2613) again  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2615) this person is then you can blame the  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2617) child for being  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2618) disabled and so on yeah so from the same  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2621) thing so they they have  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2623) um it's it's  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2626) what it appears to be anyways is that  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2627) guru nanak apparently spoke out against  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2628) the caste system but there are aspects  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2630) of it that kind of still stayed in so  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2632) typically that they are ex it's an  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2634) expectation that you would marry within  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2636) your caste  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2637) um when they would build their their  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2639) gurudwara which is like their their most  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2641) of their place but they certainly were  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2642) against where the indies were yeah so it  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2644) was it was it wasn't that explicit but  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2646) there's still remnants of that um once  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2649) you go through this life cycle you get  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2650) sort of yeah multi which is uh unity  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2653) again with that divine being so very  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2654) similar to hinduism so you you get with  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2656) nirvana or you  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2658) i i didn't come across this term but  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2660) yeah they talk about you go back you  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2662) kind of  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2662) go back into the unity so that that  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2664) phrase of like the cup and the water  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2666) it's not just with him like they  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2667) attribute that to anyone that's got that  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2669) atmosphere you go back into  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2671) but then you've got another issue  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2673) again which we discussed in the previous  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2674) session which is that well if we're  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2676) already  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2677) if it's already a pantheistic notion  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2678) then what  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2680) whatever you do is going to be relevant  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2682) to that being the case in other words if  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2683) you're a good person it's still going to  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2685) be like a drop in the ocean than if  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2687) you're a bad person because god is  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2688) everywhere and everything is good  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2690) so being going to that high level  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2693) is going to be irrespective to the  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2695) the extent to which human beings  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2696) supervise the nature of god  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2698) or the vice versa or not  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2701) you know anyway yeah there's also a  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2704) question about if you're just going to  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2705) critique it from a theological  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2706) standpoint like what what what exactly  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2708) are you not saying about god that like  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2710) you've now go you know you know  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2712) put god into i don't know how many  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2713) different parts and what a part of him  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2715) and every single human being yes and  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2717) then you know so  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2718) is the god now deficient because he's  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2719) got parts out of him that are going to  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2721) go back to him in the end it's a good  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2723) point it goes back to taqib the the  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2724) argument from uh taqib that we've made  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2727) for the existence of god anything that's  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2728) weird our parts are dependent the  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2730) universe is made out of parts therefore  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2731) the universe is dependent well if this  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2733) if this god is made up of parts and  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2734) different animals and these kind of  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2735) things then he's dependent as well  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2737) you know do you want to talk about  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2739) rituals as well yes some of these  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2740) rituals oh actually  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2742) let's see ahmad have you got anything on  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2743) reincarnation  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2746) um  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2748) not necessarily but it's it's the idea  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2750) their idea of reincarnation is similar  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2752) to the hindu i mean they take it from  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2754) hinduism which is  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2756) everything that you just mentioned right  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2757) if a person is bad in this life then um  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2760) they'll be bad in the next life uh the  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2762) one thing i i do want to say though is  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2764) that um  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2766) you know i i had a friend who uh who was  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2768) sick who converted to islam and one of  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2771) the things they told me is that  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2773) um sikhism is not as i says with all  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2776) respect but it's not a complete religion  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2778) and that after death  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2780) the religion is silent almost as if the  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2783) religion didn't really create a proper  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2786) eschatology of what would happen after  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2788) so many of the things that are there  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2790) that are taught they're things that they  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2792) don't necessarily have problems with so  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2794) i once did an  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2796) interfaith gathering with sikhs and the  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2798) question of death was brought up as to  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2801) what happens after you die um and they  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2804) were all silent and they all had a  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2806) problem with you know their religion  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2808) saying of what happens after death and  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2811) so i think in the realm of darwin that  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2813) might be an  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2814) interesting conversation is a  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2816) conversation of death  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2817) and what happens afterwards because the  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2819) idea that we become one with god after  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2822) this whole reincarnation cycle doesn't  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2823) sit well  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2825) with them because they don't believe in  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2826) heaven or hell so i think this might be  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2828) a nice way to uh to do this this will be  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2831) a nice conversation to have with them  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2834) yes absolutely now let's move on to rich  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2837) thank you for that  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2838) let's move on to the last part of uh  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2840) today's session which is about rituals  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2842) tell us about the 5ks tell us about the  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2844) dagger that they have with them you know  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2846) that in this country you're allowed to  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2847) have by law you're allowed to you know  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2849) carry uh people are interested and  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2850) intrigued about these things but let's  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2852) let's get the basics right what what are  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2853) the rituals that we need to know  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2857) see i'm sort of about over the brother  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2858) that was yeah but from what i was able  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2860) to gather one of them was significant  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2862) rituals is what they call uh amrit  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2865) which is uh it's translated as baptism  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2868) but from what i saw it's not it's not  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2869) the same place it doesn't involve a  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2870) process of getting dipped into  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2872) it's like a pool uh you've got five uh  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2875) holy seeks who are called um panch piare  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2878) i don't know if i'm saying that  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2879) correctly we've got a sixth one who saw  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2881) sits uh in attendance on the um  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2884) the gts uh and this this process takes  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2887) place at these five seeks they prepare  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2888) some holy water which is called the  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2890) amrit  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2891) um and then that water is is given to  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2894) given to the person and they drink it  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2896) and this is they will sing some of the  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2897) hymns from the from their book i've got  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2900) the names here but i'm not gonna put  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2901) everyone through listening to me trying  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2902) to pronounce them  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2904) they've also got this is now sort of  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2906) this issue of the five k's so there was  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2909) a the guru who is who is responsible for  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2912) the creation of the khalsa which is our  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2914) king what is the khalsa just it seems  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2916) like that's their conception of like the  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2919) community okay the the general community  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2922) yeah a similar concept um  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2925) and so these five k's  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2927) they're they're physical symbols of  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2929) faith that are worn by sikhs  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2932) um  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2934) and so the five of them are is kesh  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2937) which is uncut here  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2938) kara and that one  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2945) which is distilled bracelet kanga which  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2947) is a wooden cone uh kacha which is the  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2950) cotton underwear and uh kierpin which is  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2953) the the still sword so i've got all of  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2955) those except for the uh  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2957) the uncut thing  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2959) i've got wooden actually used to sell  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2961) wooden uh combs myself  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2963) what happened with that oh that's gonna  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2965) happen it was actually get i have to be  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2966) honest i was getting the material from  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2968) china so i had to close the company  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2971) i don't want to be a hypocrite anymore  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2974) okay so uh with the um the uncut hair so  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2979) there seems to be various reasons that  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2980) they do this  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2982) the founder which is the the founder of  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2984) this this this community uh guru gobind  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2986) singh  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2987) apparently this was sort of this is the  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2989) last he's the last guru right uh i'm not  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2992) sure okay i think he might be i think  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2995) he apparently  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2996) this was his appearance uh this is here  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=2998) that they should they should um i'm not  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3000) sure if this is polemicized or not but  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3002) that he should uh the sikh should only  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3003) about his head to the guru not to the  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3005) baba  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3006) uh that's the baba  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3008) yeah  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3017) [Music]  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3019) so a way to differentiate from other  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3022) beliefs was  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3024) he then he brought this all this i see  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3026) yeah  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3027) yeah so there is definitely that aspect  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3029) they'll say that um the hair is part of  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3031) god's creation and are keeping it uncut  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3034) indicates that one is willing to  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3035) accept god's gift as god intended why  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3038) not the nails  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3039) oh that's yeah because the nails why not  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3041) cut the wire just leave the nails like  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3043) that you know  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3045) just like the hair  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3047) yeah okay yeah  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3049) for them it's a symbol of uh both  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3050) holiness and strength  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3053) but what if it was scientifically shown  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3055) that it's less hygienic to have pubic  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3057) hair under your arms in in that area  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3061) yeah so obviously sikh women as well are  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3063) forbidden to cut any body hair or even  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3065) to treat them you need to trim their  
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3066) eyebrows vagina hair for example under  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3068) the so we expect  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3070) i see women have  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3072) hair in the vagina area and they have  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3074) hair  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3075) sorry to say under the the armpits as  
[0:51:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3077) well  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3078) and that  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3079) what if it's confirmed scientifically  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3081) that this kind of thing could cause  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3082) problems hygiene related  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3087) do you know anything about how they  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3088) divorce their wives  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3090) you know how does this divorce happen in  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3092) sikhism  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3096) well like the the guy just sees the hair  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3097) has a speed locks and that's not what he  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3099) said he did they don't have do they have  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3100) talks like system he says  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3104) so yeah they can remarry so that they  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3105) can divorce only only a few of them can  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3109) oh they're not do you know anything  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3110) about divorce marriage and divorce yeah  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3113) it's it's uh it's something which is uh  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3115) highly highly discouraged and it's it's  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3118) very difficult to get  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3120) um even for a man  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3127) they believe that it's a very it's a  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3129) very great sin in general for either to  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3131) do it and only in like certain  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3132) circumstances in classical sikhism um is  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3136) one allowed to get a divorce um i think  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3139) in today's days though you know many of  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3141) them are becoming modern open-minded and  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3143) so they're kind of  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3144) you know they're going down the road of  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3146) divorce but classically it was like it's  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3148) like a big it's like in islam also it's  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3150) a big sin but for them it's like  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3152) it's almost like that christianity idea  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3154) that you know the  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3155) the woman could just not get a divorce  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3158) under any circumstance  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3160) yeah i mean islam is not a sin to get  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3161) divorced i mean it's still it's yeah  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3163) it's highly discouraged but yeah i can  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3165) see what you're saying  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3167) um and you know the process of how that  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3169) works or  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3171) um it they have some rituals right they  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3174) just open  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3175) things in it but it's uh i i don't think  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3178) it's uh i think one of the fulham i  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3180) think is some information about that  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3183) so it says here the citizen does not  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3186) give the right of divorce to  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3188) its adherence  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3189) except in extreme circumstances and even  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3192) then  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3193) since his knowledge legislated within  
[0:53:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3195) sikhism  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3197) this is but this is decided by like  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3198) western hindu or muslim order courts  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3201) okay okay and the guru granth sahib does  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3204) not specify  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3205) a award  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3207) for divorce and this is this act is not  
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3209) considered in the holy  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3211) in the holy grain  
[0:53:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3213) right  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3214) yeah i wanted to ask ahmad if you have  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3216) any information about the gurus can you  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3218) take us through guru nanak who are they  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3221) up into  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3222) the final guru how many of them they  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3224) were just a brief outline of who the  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3225) gurus were  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3228) okay  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3229) um so there was there was ten gurus  
[0:53:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3232) um  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3233) and i i think classically these were  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3235) understood as kind of like their  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3236) prophets or their sages and i think with  
[0:53:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3239) later teachings they kind of some of  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3241) them began to be associated with gods or  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3243) different manifestations of god but so  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3245) they have these ten messengers  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3247) essentially they believe that their  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3249) message was kind of timeless um it will  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3252) always be relevant um it's a form of  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3254) like internal wisdom  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3256) um and they're they're here to break you  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3258) know the caste system the bigotry the  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3260) superstition on all of these things  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3263) so  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3264) somewhat similar to the idea of a of a  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3266) nabi so there was ten of them and then  
[0:54:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3269) ultimately it culminated with the tenth  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3271) one which was the guru gobind who was  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3273) really the one who created the theology  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3275) many of the theology  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3278) did any of them engage in warfare did  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3280) they get into polygamous marriages is  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3282) there anything interesting that you want  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3283) to tell us about any of the gurus  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3286) so when you when you study mobile  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3287) history you find that  
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3290) sikhism is largely a pacifistic religion  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3293) until their relationship with the moguls  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3297) um  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3297) and you know their relationship with  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3299) orenzei  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3300) jahan jahangir  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3302) um and seeks traditionally in their  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3305) narrative they they believed that the  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3307) sikhs were persecuted because of their  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3309) religion  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3310) whereas in fact if you read many of the  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3312) many modern scholars today people like  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3315) parjo obarai who's a sick himself they  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3318) really denounce this idea that the  
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3319) mughals fought them solely because of  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3321) their religion it was more so that you  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3323) know they were a threat to the state  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3325) politically and so the mughals kind of  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3327) shut them down but when the moguls did  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3329) that it ultimately turned it into a  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3332) militaristic um  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3334) as some of the gurus began to join you  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3336) know began to use military um uh began  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3340) to engage in military expeditions  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3344) yeah  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3344) no no  
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3345) which gurus did that and uh did you know  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3347) any stories in particular that you wanna  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3349) tell us about that  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3351) um  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3353) uh the ninth guru guru tegh bahadur  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3356) sahib shah i'm pretty sure it was him  
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3358) yeah um  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3359) but he he i believe that him in orange  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3361) zip had the famous relationship and  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3364) origin um ultimately had him hunted down  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3366) but he was one but as several of them i  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3369) believe two are yeah and what was the  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3372) how did he hunted down can you explain  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3375) how that ended  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3377) okay well the problem here is there's so  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3380) many stories there's so many different  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3382) accounts to it um  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3384) one of the gurus um uh i i don't know if  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3387) he was a six or i think or he was a  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3389) seventh uh he was guru um  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3393) he was somebody who was very  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3395) he was  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3397) he was somebody who was involved in  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3398) military he led the sikhs to fight  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3401) against the mobiles  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3403) he always you know he boosted the  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3405) military spirit of the sikhs um  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3408) but you know so this whole i'll give you  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3411) one case study example i don't know the  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3412) name it might have been the ninth guru  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3415) guru tech bahadur but  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3418) he leaves this movement and they begin  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3420) to they try they try to this is one one  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3423) account and they try to boycott you know  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3426) the mughals uh and they try to create  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3428) their own state um  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3431) and so obviously they begin to engage in  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3432) military expeditions and the moguls  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3435) obviously are trying to shut down  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3437) any revolt any rebellion  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3440) and so they fight against them and then  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3442) ultimately the moguls kill them uh in  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3444) many times the moguls with with people  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3446) they wanted to you know uh when they  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3449) wanted to deter people from doing things  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3450) like this they would behead them  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3452) so some of the gurus uh were beheaded uh  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3455) and then this in sikhism you have all  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3457) this folklore about the guru's head  
[0:57:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3459) coming back and stuff like that such and  
[0:57:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3461) forth so um so to answer your first  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3465) question yes some of the gurus did  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3467) engage in military expeditions against  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3470) the moguls and they were ultimately  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3471) beheaded  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3476) [Music]  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3477) yeah and the splitting in the middle  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3479) have you seen this kind of thing as well  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3482) oh what do you mean splitting in the  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3483) middle uh  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3485) one one particular guru was well there's  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3488) a story i'm not sure to extend the  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3490) veracity of this historical account but  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3491) he's split in the middle  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3493) and then he was brought back again to  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3495) life is that a fake history or  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3498) oh well it depends uh  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3501) uh historian hardrock override claims  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3504) that many of these narratives that seeks  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3506) are taught from their parents and from  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3508) their uh goldwaters and stuff they they  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3510) don't really have any historical facts  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3512) at all they're just it's just mythology  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3514) so okay with the story like that you  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3516) know in our opinion but we know that  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3518) they were at least beheaded right  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3520) some of them yeah  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3521) yeah  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3523) okay we do believe that and do they have  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3525) a did they consider them martyrs or do  
[0:58:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3527) they consider them  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3529) losers yeah  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3531) no no they consider them are marvelous  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3532) they revere all of their gurus  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3535) they have like a crucifixion narrative  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3536) where you know there's  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3540) uh  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3541) it it is like a crucifixion um it's a  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3543) story they tell um and they they extol  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3546) the virtues of the guru and how the guru  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3548) stood up for us for our religion but if  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3551) you see many of these um extremist  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3553) groups that you know call some of them  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3555) you don't want to call for the khalistan  
[0:59:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3557) you know the the state um they they  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3560) recall these stories and talk about how  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3561) these are how the gurus were the real  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3563) heroes  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3565) right right right and that's that's why  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3566) you find there's a bit of hostility  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3568) sometimes hostile narratives towards  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3571) muslim communities  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3573) it is absolutely huge especially if you  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3576) speak to the older the the older sikhs  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3579) many of them hold this um animosity not  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3582) all right but some of them do hold this  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3584) animosity if you mention the local  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3586) empire to them all of them will  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3588) inevitably condemn it you know  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3591) uh say all these nasty things about the  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3593) mogul so that that is still parcel much  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3596) alive today  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3599) and do you think that that manifests  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3600) itself sociologically in in the real  
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3603) world  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3605) 100 i believe that some uh again not all  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3608) of them right we're not generalizing but  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3610) some of them um  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3611) uh well all of them that are religious  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3614) you'll find they know these stories very  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3616) deeply and with that there is an  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3618) animosity towards the mobile empire and  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3620) the narrative now that the mughals  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3622) oppressed us because we were sick  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3625) now they believe that look muslims  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3626) persecuted just because we had a  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3628) different religion um so  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3631) you know in the city that i live right  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3633) muslims and sikhs are are too large  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3636) the muslims are a minority but their  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3638) their relationship between us is very  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3639) peaceful but if these topics are ever  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3642) ever brought up there would be  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3643) inevitably lots of animosity towards one  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3646) another  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3649) and very very very very interesting uh  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3651) definitely  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3652) is there anything more you have on  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3654) rituals yes no i'm just i'm just sorry i  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3657) was directing that too to one of our  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3658) guys here shakir he's gonna start off  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3660) and then i'll come back to you okay  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3663) okay i just wanted to mention yeah  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3664) there's also an eleventh guru  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3667) yep  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3674) so technically they believe there's 11.  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3676) yep all right perfect yeah  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3679) yeah so uh just continuing with the case  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3681) so we spoke about kesh which is the  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3683) uncut hair  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3684) uh  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3686) yeah okay yeah so so with that it's um  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3689) for them it's a symbol of of strength  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3693) uh holiness  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3694) um this idea that hair is part of god's  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3697) creation so keeping the hair uncut  
[1:01:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3699) indicates that one is willing to accept  
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3701) god's gift so if you're bold you know we  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3705) i guess it depends how voluntary that  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3707) balding is  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3708) right right yeah  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3710) so uh  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3711) yeah so then so that the sikh should  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3713) only bow his head to the guru not to the  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3715) baba  
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3716) and um it follows the appearance of the  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3718) guru uh the guru gobind singh who's the  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3720) founder of the  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3722) the the khalsa which is sort of their  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3724) concept of the um the sikh community  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3726) then they've got the kara which is the  
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3728) steel bracelet  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3730) it's a symbol of restraint restraint  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3732) gentility  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3733) um it's a reminder that the sikh should  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3734) not do anything that the guru would not  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3736) approve because the this is a symbol  
[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3738) that's linked to the guru it's a symbol  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3740) of permanent bonding uh being a link in  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3742) the chain of the of the community so  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3743) it's like a it's made of a steel  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3746) and it's not gold or silver because it's  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3748) not an ornament the cone  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3751) sort of symbolizes a clean mind and body  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3754) since it keeps the uncut hair neat and  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3756) tidy um and it sort of symbolizes the  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3759) importance of of looking after the body  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3760) which god has created so  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3764) i guess they're trying to give reverence  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3765) to the body so you know grow out the  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3767) hair because it's it's part of god's  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3768) creation and also keep it clean and tidy  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3770) then they've got the catcher which are  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3772) special underwear um and it's a pair of  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3774) breeches that you know must not come  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3776) below the knee  
[1:02:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3778) and so for the sikh warriors of the 18th  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3780) and 19th centuries um it was very useful  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3783) i think we just talked about the warfare  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3784) it was very suitable for warfare when  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3786) they're rising or riding a horse  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3787) and it's a symbol of chastity as well  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3789) um which is linked to something i'm  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3791) going to discuss in a second and then  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3793) this is the carpal which is the  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3794) ceremonial sword  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3796) it says that there's no fixed style but  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3798) from my understood it's normally a  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3799) double double-edged  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3802) sword  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3803) and it's kept in a sheath that can be  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3805) worn  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3806) over or under clothing because it  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3808) symbolizes you know spirituality the  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3810) soldier part  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3811) of the uh the soldier saints um defense  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3813) of the good and the weak the struggle  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3814) against injustice uh and so in that way  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3817) it's sort of like a metaphor for god as  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3819) well in their religion  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3820) um and then every sikh remembers that  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3822) over these the warriors or the martyrs  
[1:03:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3824) since 19 16 99  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3827) and every living member is united with  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3829) them uh having adopted the five k's so  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3831) these are five  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3833) ornaments or ornaments about five you  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3835) know items of clothing that the uh the  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3837) sikhs would wear and what to do today  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3839) what about day-to-day rituals that they  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3841) do  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3842) uh  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3843) praying and singing and uh chanting  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3846) uh ahmed let's go to you because thanks  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3849) for that jacket that was good do you  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3851) know anything about that  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3854) yeah so um  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3857) the way their rituals are broken up uh  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3860) it's uh it does draw some similarities  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3863) with islam  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3865) you know they  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3866) you know what what's interesting is one  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3867) you know when many of them begin their  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3869) prayer they recite something  
[1:04:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3871) from the adi grant which is like the  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3873) beginning of their scripture the gts  
[1:04:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3877) which says there is one supreme being  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3880) the eternal reality  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3882) the supreme being is the creator without  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3884) fear and devoid of hatred immortal never  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3888) incarnated self-existence  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3891) known by grace through the guru so  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3894) um if you go to the gurdwaras and stuff  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3896) that's sometimes  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3898) many of them start their prayer  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3900) um with that statement because that's  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3902) their basic statement of belief  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3904) so they come they bowed their head to  
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3906) the scripture many of them believe that  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3909) the scripture itself because it is the  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3911) 11th guru some many of them also believe  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3914) that it is god within it right those who  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3917) adopt the pantheistic worldview so  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3919) they'll kind of make their subju to it  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3922) um  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3924) and that sort  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3925) and then they have other prayers as well  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3927) but many of their prayers involve  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3929) singing so there's a lot of singing of  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3931) their of their hymns and from their  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3933) scriptures similar to hinduism  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3936) and some could make the argument similar  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3938) to islam and how we you know we recite  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3940) the quran beautifully  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3943) but  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3944) yeah most of it involves  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3946) you know they have their own zakat where  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3947) they give their money  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3949) to the gurdwara but the reciting of  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3951) scripture is kind of their main thing  
[1:05:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3953) and then making a sort of prayer is  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3955) usually what their their entire prayer  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3957) um  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3958) and is it can that be done sitting down  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3960) or are they are there like postures and  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3965) uh  
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3966) from what i recall there there isn't  
[1:06:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3968) necessarily posture it's kind of like uh  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3970) it's segregated right so the females  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3972) that on one side the males from the  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3973) other side um everybody kind of covers  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3976) their head um and they're usually just  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3978) sitting down when they recite it there  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3980) isn't necessarily a a bodily movement  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3983) okay  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3984) well i think we covered quite a lot and  
[1:06:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3986) i just wanted to think i was just  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3988) thinking as you were speaking i know  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3989) it's a bit  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3990) off topic maybe but  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3992) you know this whole reincarnation thing  
[1:06:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3995) i feel like it actually encourages  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3997) individualism because if you think  
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=3999) yourself imagine you're in a family  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4001) right and you think well i'm going to be  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4003) it's conceivable that my son's gonna be  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4005) a snake and i'm gonna be a completely  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4006) different animal from the animal kingdom  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4009) like he could be a kangaroo i could be a  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4010) snake i'm gonna be separated from my son  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4013) in a way which  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4015) there's no incentive  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4016) to be in the same place at the same time  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4018) like if if i'm good and my son is good  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4020) we'll both be in the same place  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4022) well if i'm if i'm back if i'm good to a  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4024) degree of 80 and my son's good then he's  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4026) gonna be a kangaroo and i'm gonna be a  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4028) snake  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4029) so i'm thinking to myself you know  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4032) i'm just gonna do my thing you know  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4034) although of course you could say that as  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4036) well with the heaven you're gonna just  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4037) have no help but at least in heaven you  
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4040) go you you could be united with your  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4041) family there's more there's more  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4043) incentive that sense you know  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4045) but i think it can be quite a bleak  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4046) eschatological picture  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4048) like you know it's a choice of being a  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4050) human again which isn't the best  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4051) experience  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4053) or being a snake or kangaroo or  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4055) something like that which is probably  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4056) even more  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4058) uh miserable to be honest with you and  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4060) also the idea that you you know you're  
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4062) not going to be with your family again  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4063) so this is kind of  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/4j44ib_wGBE?t=4065) my goodbye to my loved ones right yeah
