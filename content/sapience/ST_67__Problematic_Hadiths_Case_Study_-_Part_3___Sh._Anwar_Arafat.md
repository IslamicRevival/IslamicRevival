### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlfuqSwdGX0&t=0) - [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlfuqSwdGX0&t=600)

 discusses how to deal with problematic hadiths, including by identifying the historical context and context within other narrations. It also explains how to understand the makasud, or goals of the hadith. For example, the speaker discusses a Hadith in which the Prophet Muhammad warns women that they are responsible for a majority of those sent to Hell. He provides context for the Hadith by discussing how women often rely on their husbands for financial support, and how this can lead to them neglecting their own good deeds. He then encourages women to give charity independently, and urges them to do so even when their husbands are not willing to do so themselves.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlfuqSwdGX0&t=0)** The sixth tool for understanding problematic Hadith is checking authenticity. This is done by consulting classical books of Hadith that explain the Hadith in detail. This helps to ensure that the Hadith is authentic and has not been altered or changed over time.

[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=15) thoughts where we discuss the  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=18) philosophical issues we answer some of  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=20) the contentions that are brought against  
[0:00:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=21) Islam and we offer a robust case for the  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=24) veracity and beauty of Islam as a way of  
[0:00:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=26) life  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=27) my name is and today we are continuing  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=30) our problematic Hadith  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=34) and applying our toolkit and  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=36) understanding it inshallah we are on  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=38) tool number five with our problem like  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=40) Hadith remember the problematic Hadith  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=42) seems to indicate that women are  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=46) deficient in their intelligence  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=47) deficient in their minds and deficient  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=49) in their religion does it actually do  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=52) that this is what we're finding out  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=54) uh tool number five and Tool number five  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=56) is access to the books that actually  
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=61) explain the Hadith right and we did this  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=64) I have a whole paper where you can  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=66) access it in shalatara online I  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=69) consulted over a dozen classical books  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=73) of shuru that actually go over this  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=75) because this Hadith appears in many  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=77) books of Hadith and so any will actually  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=79) explain it we'll go through it  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=82) and that's something that we did and it  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=84) helps obviously give that understanding  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=86) now that is a classical understanding  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=89) remember our sincerity to the religion  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=91) our sincerity of playing tool number one  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=93) is also realizing that classically what  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=97) was important to them isn't necessarily  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=99) what's important to us  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=101) some Scholars problematize this Hadith  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=103) classically some did not now a person  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=106) might say hey wait a second those who  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=107) did not does that mean that they're  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=109) biased against women does that mean that  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=110) they have an issue Etc no not  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=112) necessarily remember they had their own  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=114) issues that they were dealing with in  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=115) their own lens their own Paradigm the  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=117) world was very different we can apply  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=119) that by the way to almost any era to  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=122) almost any  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=124) um geographical place as well in the  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=125) west if I looked a thousand years ago  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=127) what were their comments on women I  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=129) would be shocked and surprised and yet  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=131) in some ways  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=132) there might be some wisdom to be taken  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=134) from some of their writings as well it's  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=136) not that I completely write them off  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=137) because they don't see the world as I do  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=140) I have to put them in their place and  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=142) understand that as well some of the  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=143) books of by the way the books that  
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=145) explain the Hadith some of them don't  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=148) even come across the issue of the  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=150) deficiency they don't even address it  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=152) because they're not interested in it  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=154) from that perspective they're interested  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=155) in the rulings that apply for the Muslim  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=159) to apply in their life so for example in  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=163) bukhari itself this Hadith appears three  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=166) different times one time it appears in  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=169) the book of menstruation because of its  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=174) comment on Menses where it makes that  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=178) Proclamation that a woman if she's on  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=180) her menstrual cycle she does not pray  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=183) she does not fast perfect so that's why  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=185) he put it in that chapter so many of the  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=187) many of the explanations are going to  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=190) tackle the Hadith from that perspective  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=191) because they're already on that chapter  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=193) they're not going to address the whole  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=195) other theological issues that are in it  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=197) this is why a person might access some  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=199) of these books and be like hey wait a  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=200) second he's not even talking about this  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=201) and that's actually correct in the  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=204) second chapter that it appears it  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=206) appears in the book of zakah and it's  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=208) because there's an added section where  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=211) after the prophet because remember the  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=212) whole beginning of the Hadith is where  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=214) the prophetam is actually encouraging  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=215) them to donate to give and so a woman  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=217) comes to the prophet salallahu and she  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=220) says can I give my husband charity and  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=223) so  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=224) he says yes etc etc and so she because  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=227) of her question is asking about charity  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=229) the scholars will discuss that whole  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=231) issue of can a wife give her husband  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=234) charity if she's wealthier than he is  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=236) and that's a whole other subject for  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=238) another day inshallah right so depending  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=240) on where the scholar put it he obviously  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=243) has a point because he wants people to  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=245) understand something a ruling etc etc so  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=247) I have to realize that that not  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=248) everybody is going to have the same  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=249) problems that I have what we  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=251) problematize now is not what people  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=253) problematize a long time ago  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=255) that's not necessarily a bad thing we  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=258) don't automatically write them off  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=259) because they don't share the passions  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=261) that we do right everybody has their  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=264) historical place so that's number five  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=266) number six tool number six  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=269) is checking authenticity  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=272) and as we said If a person is paying you  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=274) know what I mean attention to this and  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=275) knows this since we said it's Muslim  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=278) both of these this is of the highest  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=281) degrees of authenticity outside of these  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=283) books it appears  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=287) it also a version of it appears  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=291) and in fact the version of the helps us  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=294) understand it even more even though the  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=296) version of the of Imam does not contain  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=300) this problematic phrase which is that  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=302) they are deficient in their intellect  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=304) deficient in religion it has the first  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=306) part where he's encouraging them to give  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=308) and that they can constituted a majority  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=311) of the people of the Hellfire meaning  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=312) women  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=312) five different companions have narrated  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=315) this Hadith so many unique Chains It's  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=318) almost impossible from a Hadith  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=319) perspective to put any flaw on this  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=322) Hadith so that we know that it's  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=323) completely authentic but this is a step  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=325) that a person can do if I come across a  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=327) problematic Hadith and I realize it's  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=328) weak and it goes against a lot of what I  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=330) don't understand about Islam that I can  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=332) write it off I know that this probably  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=334) isn't true but remember it's  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=335) probabilistic in nature when I look at  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=338) this and I see hey wait a second the  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=340) prophetam is saying this checking  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=341) authenticity is something that a person  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=343) should do however in this case it's  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=345) completely authentic now  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=347) there are people remember we said  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=350) that their bias might cause them to  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=353) write off Hadith in its entirety because  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=356) of one or two problematic how did they  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=358) come across because they don't like them  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=359) or doesn't agree with their own Paradigm  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=361) their own worldview  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=363) now while understanding that they have a  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=365) problem and I completely understand this  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=366) in fact this is why we're doing this to  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=368) just write off Hadith in its entirety  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=370) because I don't like it is incorrect and  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=373) it's not  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=375) a stable or sound method because writing  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=378) off Hadith in its entirety introduces a  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=381) hundred more problems thousands of more  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=384) problems  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=385) then we're solving I might solve like in  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=388) this case oh if I just say well I don't  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=390) believe in Hadith anyways so there's no  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=392) issue women are not deficient in their  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=393) intellect and intelligence yeah but now  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=395) I've introduced so many new problems  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=398) it's not even worth it it's not even  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=399) practical or pragmatic or wise and so  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=404) we have to realize that  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=406) it is authentic now we have to face it  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=408) we have to deal with it and these are  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=410) where some of the challenges come in for  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=412) some people  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=413) tool number seven  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=415) is understanding the makasud which is  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=418) there are goals of the Hadith there are  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=420) goals of legislation there's goals even  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=422) within the Quran itself  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=425) there's wisdom in everything is the  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=427) prophet saws trying to say something he  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=429) is  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=430) what is that so let's look into it and  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=433) we can do this by the way we can apply  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=435) it and inshallah we will when we do the  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=436) reread but I want to mention that tool  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=438) here that  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=439) if I know that even if I don't  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=442) understand the Hadith or  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=444) I can at least acknowledge okay this is  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=446) somewhat problematic I can at least say  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=448) you know I don't understand but I do  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=449) know that I trust the prophet saws  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=452) and I trust his wisdom maybe there's  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=455) something behind what he's saying  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=456) there's not a problem saying I don't  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=459) know there's not a problem in saying  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=460) this isn't clear there is a problem in  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=462) saying you know what I don't understand  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=463) this I'm just going to throw it out  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=465) we that's why we need patience right so  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=468) saying I don't know investigating  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=470) further I think this is one of the best  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=472) courses that a Muslim can actually apply  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=474) number eight and number nine are both  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=476) related meaning understanding the  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=478) historical context and the context  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=479) within the other narrations okay  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=481) historical context  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=484) tells us that most of the versions does  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=487) not mention that there was Aid or there  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=489) was a but in some of them the ones in  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=491) bukhari  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=494) mentioned that there was a the prophetam  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=497) gave a sermon and that there was a  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=499) congregation people gathered now the  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=501) version of bukhari the narrator says it  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=504) was either  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=505) he's not sure  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=507) the version in what thought he actually  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=509) says it was during the solar eclipse  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=514) now there's certainty he says it was  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=517) during the eclipse we had the prayer and  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=520) after the prayer he gave now you don't  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=522) have to give a after the eclipse prayer  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=524) but he did because people had gathered  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=526) and he wanted to encourage them to  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=528) actually give donate etc etc which is  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=530) what we should be doing during the  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=531) eclipse prayer this makes a lot of sense  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=533) now because if it's during AIDS Aid is  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=535) usually a joyous Affair Etc and he would  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=538) give the women their own sermon Etc but  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=540) he would encourage them to do good and  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=541) what not but in this one in this case he  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=544) seems very concerned plus the wording  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=548) even though it mentions that it could be  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=550) Aid actually alludes to the eclipse  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=553) prayer why he says I have been shown  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=556) that you were a majority of the people  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=558) of the Hellfire now pause and the  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=561) version of motla the prophet salallahu  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=564) while he's praying the eclipse prayer he  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=566) says while he is praying he said in  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=569) front of him Allah opened up like a  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=571) portal or whatever and he saw  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=574) Paradise in front of him and he saw from  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=577) its fruits and its trees so much so that  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=579) he says if I were to reach out with my  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=581) hand and grab the grapes he said I saw  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=584) some grapes and grabbed them and brought  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=586) them they would have remained here in  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=587) the Dunya and you would have eaten from  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=589) them forever they would have lasted  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=591) eternally because the paradise is  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=594) eternal and anything in it even if it's  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=596) taken outside is also Eternal he says  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=600) and then Allah removed that and then he  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=602) showed him the Hellfire and it  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=604) frightened him so much so and he looked  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=606) and he saw a lot of women inside  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=609) this is where he became concerned this  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=611) is why after the Salah finished Etc he  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=613) gave a general sermon and he went to the  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=615) women specifically to remind them  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=619) this is where when we have this  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=621) inter-contextual  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=623) or intra-contextual analysis it actually  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=626) makes a lot of sense he just saw this  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=629) and now he wants to share that whatever  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=631) he saw with the women that were there  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=633) that were present so he goes over to  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=635) them why specifically the women he was  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=638) telling them look you know the reality  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=639) is a lot of women  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=641) especially when it comes to donating  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=643) money  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=644) they rely on their husbands and not on  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=645) themselves because there are also many  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=647) of them rely on their husbands for their  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=648) financial upkeep and whatnot and and and  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=651) maintenance  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=654) but they also rely on their husbands for  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=656) their Good Deeds financially and so he  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=659) says the first thing that says o women  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=662) you need to give charity  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=665) a lot of women don't give their own  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=666) charity this is what he said and by the  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=668) way this is a problem that we still have  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=669) today when we do fundraisers  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=673) unfortunately the majority of the people  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=675) who donate our men and not necessarily  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=676) women this doesn't mean that women don't  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=677) have their own money but they assume  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=679) that oh my husband will give for us  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=680) that's true the husband will give for  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=682) you but you have your own Deeds to to to  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=684) to to get as well don't wait for your  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=687) husband and this is basically what he's  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=688) saying  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=690) and then he says I I saw that you made a  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=692) majority of the people of the Hellfire  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=693) he was worried for them he's not stating  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=696) a fact he's trying to make it so that  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=698) that's not the case meaning that isn't  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=702) necessarily set in stone number one  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=703) number two even if it is women make a  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=706) majority of humankind anyways so taking  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=709) tool number eight and Tool number nine  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=710) we can see that now we're adding a lot  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=712) of context to what's going on we  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=714) understand it a little bit better step  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=715) number 10 is the next one that we will  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=718) do inshallah when we'll come back for  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/QlfuqSwdGX0?t=719) the next episode inshallah
