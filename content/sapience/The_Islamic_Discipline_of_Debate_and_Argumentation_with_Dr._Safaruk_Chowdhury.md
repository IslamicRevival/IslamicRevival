[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=328) takes it from strength to strength  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=329) um um  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=333) and so you know keep that up keep that  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=335) up you know how  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=336) difficult it is out there in the field  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=339) especially that strata of darwin  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=342) because it's upper march and so  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=346) you know you're better than most you  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=347) know it's very different from being in  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=349) the  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=350) sort of not the low end of the field but  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=352) the less intellectually challenging area  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=355) of the field so  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=356) handler each has its own place isn't it  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=358) as you know but  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=360) there are levels there are levels so  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=363) well i mean  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=364) in terms of the first question i mean  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=368) i've always um i always try and write  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=371) books  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=371) i wish i had yeah i always try and write  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=374) books  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=375) i wish i had and when i was growing up  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=378) trying to study islam there was always  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=381) certain books  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=382) i would wish i had and maybe that would  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=385) have helped  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=386) in my own development my own  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=387) understanding  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=389) and ever since i've kind of used that  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=391) that motto i want to try and write books  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=394) not necessarily academic books but just  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=396) try and write  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=397) something that i wish i had when i was  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=400) trying to develop and learn  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=402) islam and so this subject matter  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=406) of islamic argumentation or islamic  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=409) theory of argumentation and disputation  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=411) was one  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=412) area i didn't find anything  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=416) so short simple within the english  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=418) language there may be stuff in arabic  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=419) language and  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=420) and there are and maybe very simple text  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=422) for those who are arabic speaking but  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=423) for us  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=424) who are you know mainly english-speaking  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=425) communities  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=427) i didn't have anything it was always  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=428) been on my mind to write something  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=430) on it um it wasn't it wasn't very good  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=433) but at least something out there  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=435) so i'm always i've always been  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=437) interested in writing books that have  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=438) been overlooked or neglected  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=440) so one area like balarama wrote a little  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=443) lame book on that  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=445) um certain areas of fit that not many  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=447) people touch on like in  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=448) employment things like that so  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=451) this is just another one of the books  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=453) that i'm trying to  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=455) fill a fill a gap or perceive what i see  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=458) a perceived gap  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=460) and so yeah it's a lost discipline  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=463) um a lot some people even said to me  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=465) they didn't know there was a theory of  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=467) argumentation within the islamic  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=468) intellectual  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=470) tradition they never knew it existed  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=472) they just thought it was a modern  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=473) yeah they just knew the modern thing so  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=476) my aim was  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=477) was to do that and what made me sort of  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=479) hurry up with it a bit is um  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=480) you know i think last year there were  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=483) two  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=484) famous uh imams let's say from the  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=487) midlands  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=488) you know who had a pre-debate um  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=491) debate yeah type thing and  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=494) um that that got quite heated and  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=497) um they're both obviously knowledgeable  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=499) but you know one one of the  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=501) knowledgeable interlocutors  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=503) didn't want to proceed unless they  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=505) follow the rules of  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=506) what we call monado you know the rules  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=509) of debate  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=510) and so that triggered in my mind i've  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=512) got to get this book finished my notes  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=514) were just bit  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=515) scatters i thought i've got to put it  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=516) together quickly because obviously  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=519) it's become notorious now you know  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=521) argumentation  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=522) this this subject matter has piqued  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=525) everyone's interest  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=527) uh it's prickly everyone's interested so  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=528) i thought let me get it out as soon as i  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=530) can and hopefully it can be a benefit  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=532) but um the aim really is for general  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=534) students and madrasa students to  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=536) understand  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=537) um the practical purpose of  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=540) argumentation and debate  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=542) um and what the the epistemological  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=546) goal is why are we doing it and the  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=549) goal is really you know it's it's  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=551) truth-seeking  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=552) so um once we find the truth  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=556) we submit to it and the argumentation is  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=558) supposed to get us there  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=560) okay good  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=563) just to add to that would you say as  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=566) well at the same time because of the  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=568) social context that we live in  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=569) yes debates have an epistemic goal  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=572) meaning that we want to  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=573) account for the truth you know the  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=575) famous statement of  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=576) imam shafi'i may allah have met on him  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=578) when he would pray that the truth would  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=580) come  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=581) through the mouth and the words of his  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=583) interco intellectual which shows a lot  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=585) of  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=586) sincerity but this is within the context  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=590) of course within a in a intra-muslim  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=593) discussion context but also from a  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=596) context of debating  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=597) people outside of islam not only has it  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=600) an epistemic  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=602) goal but it has a social goal it shows  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=606) the kind of veracity of islam  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=608) even when i remember when i had a debate  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=609) with professor lawrence krauss  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=611) many young students they the iman  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=615) was increased or they had more faith  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=618) they probably didn't understand many of  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=620) the arguments but because someone was on  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=621) a platform  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=623) someone was doing it was the perfect  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=625) time for recall  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=627) you know as a social performance yeah  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=631) that's the point so the point is it also  
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=633) has social  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=636) impact as well at the same time right  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=638) definitely  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=640) strategic yeah yeah that's right and if  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=643) you look at anyone who knows  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=644) uh familiar with this history will know  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=646) that there were public debates held  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=648) in the courts of the rulers things that  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=651) so  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=651) it was a part it was a feature of  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=655) in social interaction within muslim  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=657) societies islamic society so  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=659) yeah so my aim was to try and plug that  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=662) gap where i felt  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=663) well there was a perceived gap but there  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=666) was nothing out there that's just  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=667) sort of basic um that just sets out the  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=671) rules  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=672) of debate and the etiquettes of debate  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=675) yeah so that was my aim to try and get  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=677) something out  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=678) um on a bottom footing and then those  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=681) who like it or you know want to take it  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=683) further can do a better job and you know  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=685) maybe go on to higher higher works in in  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=688) the field  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=690) but even skimming through this doctor  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=691) what i've noticed is  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=693) that you know you go through for example  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=695) logical fallacies  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=696) you go from different different forms of  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=699) logic  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=700) now i would probably argue with you now  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=702) or not argue agree with you  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=704) if i'm assuming that you you you affirm  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=707) this point as well  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=708) that many who engage in debate and  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=710) dialogue  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=712) they don't know basic logical fallacies  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=715) they don't know for example how to make  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=716) a valid inference  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=718) they don't know how to make a valid  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=720) deductive argument for instance or  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=722) the different modes of logic which are  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=723) very important important in articulating  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=726) an argument  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=727) and putting an argument together and  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=729) sometimes we think we have won over our  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=731) opponent but in actual fact  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=732) we've missed our key premise or we  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=735) haven't made the necessary logical link  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=737) and this is why when you put this in  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=739) your book i found it i thought it was  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=741) fantastic it was fascinating that  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=743) exactly what we need so moving to the  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=746) second question so what does  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=748) what does mean like in a kind of islamic  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=751) intellectual theological context oh all  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=754) right  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=754) so um well the the the discipline  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=758) is is a combination of um  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=763) so the word bath in arabic generally  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=766) means or comes from the root that means  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=768) like  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=769) to to examine to investigate  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=779) it comes from the root of of  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=782) which obviously means to to see it  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=784) something to gaze at something but it  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=786) also means to like  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=788) rationally rationally investigate to  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=791) explore to examine  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=793) so put together those two words  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=796) a a definition given by those in the  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=800) field  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=800) is something like um  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=811) so um the science this discipline  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=814) is the principles by which you arrive  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=818) at or by which you know how to avoid  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=821) error in debate  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=823) so this science is supposed this  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=825) discipline is supposed to give you  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=828) the tools by which to avoid making  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=831) errors in debate  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=832) so munavala is like what we're like two  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=834) people who are  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=836) having exchange having an exchange of  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=839) views  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=840) so to arrive at to arrive at the truth  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=844) whereas that's different from uh  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=847) mujahidella  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=848) so mujahide is because it's this kind of  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=851) inheritance from the greeks you could  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=852) say  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=854) is two people having an exchange but not  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=857) to seek truth necessarily that's not the  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=859) epistemic goal rather it's  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=861) me to win the debate so i'll do you over  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=865) because i'm more eloquent than you or  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=867) happen to have on the day  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=870) i articulate myself in premises stronger  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=873) than you  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=874) but i may not necessarily be right i may  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=876) not found the truth but  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=877) i won over you so that's the difference  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=880) between yeah  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=880) jedel and  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=882) [Music]  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=889) yeah so would that be  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=893) that meaning always because when you  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=895) refer to the quran for example i think  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=897) it since chapter 16  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=898) when allah says and discuss with them  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=902) and debate with them in ways that are  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=904) better  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=905) so are we going to need the quranic word  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=908) here  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=908) the way that you've just explained it or  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=910) are we going to understand it through  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=912) for example he comments on this verse  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=914) and he says  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=916) you argue them in ways that is better  
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=918) with no gruffness and no harshness  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=920) but how did you feel at that point yeah  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=922) definitely  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=923) um obviously that judder that i  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=925) mentioned that  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=926) the meaning there was a technical  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=927) meaning like so how it's done  
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=929) within yeah within the kind of technical  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=932) um the meaning within the discipline but  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=935) allah definitely uses the word as you  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=936) mentioned in the ayah  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=938) um argue with them in the best way so we  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=940) have to have not only  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=942) not only must we employ the best proofs  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=945) but we have to employ the best day  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=947) quorum in delivering that proof  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=949) yeah and that's unfortunately something  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=951) i sense i'm sure you know you  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=954) you know you know much better than many  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=957) i think that side is lacking that side  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=960) is lacking the decorum with which you  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=961) deliver the truth or you deliver your  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=964) proofs  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=964) yeah yeah and uh well i've learned that  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=967) i mean  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=968) i've made those mistakes on my own  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=969) journey so  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=971) i think it's very important for us to  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=973) basically be the best ambassadors for  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=975) sure i mean today because of social  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=977) media  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=978) everyone has a platform and that's one  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=979) of the unfortunate things  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=981) so okay moving on then on the third  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=983) question so  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=986) so why do you think it's important those  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=988) who engage in monothera  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=990) in debates and discussions  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=993) why do you think it's important for them  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=995) to study logic  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=996) and if you can give us some examples of  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=998) the type of logic that you use in your  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1000) book  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1001) okay so  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1005) now strictly speaking i mean in the  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1007) quran does it make  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1008) a condition to use logic to argue  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1012) yeah um well maybe if we have time i'll  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1014) touch on like the quranic what i  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1016) feel is probably what the chronic method  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1019) of argumentation is but  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1020) it's not a condition in order to argue  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1022) or have a dialogue with someone or  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1024) to have a debate with someone that one  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1026) has marked with logic that's not a  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1028) condition i think that's very clear from  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1029) the quran i think that's very clear from  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1031) the sunnah  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1032) but what why logic is important  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1036) is we need to know the grammar of things  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1038) i can't remember which author  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1039) said that but we need to know the  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1040) grammar of things when you're learning a  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1041) language you need to know the grammar of  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1042) the language  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1044) similarly when you're arguing you need  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1046) to know the grammar  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1047) of the argument um and the grammar of  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1050) the argument in a manner of speaking is  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1052) logic  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1053) so logic is like it is a system that  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1055) tells you  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1057) what follows from what  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1060) so if you make a claim or you make a  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1062) statement or you  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1063) you put forward some proposition  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1067) what is entailed by that proposition or  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1070) what you can deduce or infer from that  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1072) your logic will tell you that or the  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1074) logic will tell you what you can and  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1075) what you can't  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1076) what doors you can enter in through and  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1078) what doors are closed for you  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1080) so i mean so that's very important  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1083) because  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1083) you might infer something which you're  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1085) not allowed to infer from your own claim  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1088) and that's very important that's why  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1089) allah talks about a lot you might  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1091) claim something but you have no right to  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1094) make that claim from the claims you  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1095) already made  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1096) so that's important you need to know  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1098) what route you can take  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1099) in an argumentation or debate or what  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1102) you can't and your logic will tell you  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1103) the other thing is that logic allows you  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1105) to formalize  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1106) your arguments to put them methodically  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1109) in steps  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1110) um and so by putting it methodically in  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1114) steps  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1115) you can now check whether it's valid or  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1117) not  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1118) um and it also allows you to sort of get  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1120) clarity in what you're saying  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1122) so logic is important you know because  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1125) of that  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1126) lots of times we might make arguments  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1128) but we may it may come across  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1130) jumbled it may come across a bit hazard  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1134) or it might it may not come across with  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1136) clarity but once we put it down in steps  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1139) and see what follows from what we can  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1141) get some clarity  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1142) as to what's being said and i think  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1143) that's important that's important  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1146) so in debate our le mans emphasized  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1149) putting  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1150) arguments in a logical form and that's  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1153) primarily the syllogism  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1154) so that's why i think probably the  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1156) largest chapter  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1158) in in the notes part of the support  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1161) material  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1162) is on logic where i go through some sort  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1165) of um  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1166) different types of logic so we've got  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1168) there for example  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1169) yeah so we've got here for example  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1173) page 68 onwards yeah yeah yeah  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1176) so we've got um syllogistic logic so  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1178) syllogistic logic is probably the most  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1181) familiar people would have been waving  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1183) through your own work maybe through  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1185) uh they studied logic themselves so a  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1188) syllogistic logic  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1189) looks at arguments put into three lines  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1193) two premises and a conclusion so if i  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1195) give the audience  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1197) if i give the audience one example um  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1200) so let's say premise one to line one  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1202) premise one  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1203) if god is maximally loving then he must  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1205) be maximally forgiving  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1208) you might know that not joy but this two  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1211) the biblical god is not maximally  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1213) forgiving therefore  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1215) that's the third line the biblical god  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1218) is not maximally  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1219) loving that's the syllogism that gives  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1222) you  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1222) the first premise the second premise and  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1224) a conclusion  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1226) most people when they think of logic  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1227) they think of that  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1229) like yes put it yeah putting into  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1231) syllogism  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1232) so so yeah so you've got to see logistic  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1236) logic then you've got  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1237) predicate logic predicate logic is about  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1240) statements containing things  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1242) um like uh how we describe  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1246) things so if i say zaid is tall  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1250) or amar is sure  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1254) master al-aqsa is a blessed land so  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1256) muslim  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1257) is a subject and the predicate is  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1261) blessed land because i'm qualifying the  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1263) subject al-aqsa with  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1265) the description the predicate blessed  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1267) land  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1268) zaid is tall tall is predicated of zaid  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1272) so that's predicate logic we look at  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1275) statements that describe  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1276) objects um then i think the other  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1280) thing in there is quantificational logic  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1283) quantification logic is when we make  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1284) statements involving all or some  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1287) so if i say all human beings have a  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1289) fitrah  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1290) that all i'm saying that  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1294) whatever a thing is if it is human it  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1296) has a fitra  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1298) um yeah the universal quantifier  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1303) yeah we call that the universe yeah i  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1306) did this for my m.a  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1307) and oh my god i was like it's another  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1309) language  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1313) yeah for me i prefer the philosophy of  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1315) logic  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1316) like why do we even have this stuff in  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1318) the first place  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1319) why why did that necessarily follow but  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1322) in order for me to pass their exam honda  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1324) passed it quite well  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1325) i had to trick my brain i had to trick  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1327) my brain bro  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1329) and to say right these are just the  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1330) rules of the game i'm accepting the  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1332) rules don't talk about the rules don't  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1334) philosophize the rule  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1336) and just do it and i'm telling you it  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1338) was an alien language for me and one  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1340) morning  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1341) i just got it i'll keep on writing out i  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1343) just got it so it is  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1344) it could be quite complicated with the  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1346) uh existential quantify the universal  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1348) quantum  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1349) it's more deep and you have all these  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1350) funny symbols yeah carry on absolutely  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1353) no no but you're right  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1354) yeah it is can be it can be an alien  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1356) language definitely for many and this is  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1357) why lots of people feel comfortable with  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1359) the syllogistic logic because  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1361) you use natural language like you know  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1363) to put it into syllogism you'd have to  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1364) use symbol  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1366) so the other aspect of conservation  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1367) logic is when we use words like sum  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1369) or few so i know some people rejected  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1372) allah's messenger so some  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1374) so in arabic use bard yeah so  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1378) and then you've got something in there i  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1380) think a little short section of modal  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1382) logic  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1382) now modal logic is big modal logic  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1386) is the logic that examines when we use  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1388) words like  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1389) necessary that must necessary  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1392) and possible may be so when we use words  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1395) like that we're using  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1396) modal terms um so if i say it is  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1399) possible that  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1400) i live in mecca this is possible so it's  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1404) possible that  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1405) i don't it is necessary that the whole  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1408) is greater than the parts  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1410) so it must be the case that the whole is  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1411) greater than the parts now why are these  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1413) important  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1414) because in debate or dialogue or any  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1417) form of exchange  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1419) we may be making claims um in these  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1423) forms but we're not realizing it  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1425) so we've got to be careful what we can  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1427) infer from what  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1428) and so this these logic become very very  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1431) important  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1432) but just for those who perhaps are maybe  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1434) about the book or logic is not their  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1436) thing  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1438) you know if you want to skip that  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1440) chapter do  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1441) but i think it's worth worth investing  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1444) some time in  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1446) to be familiar with basic at least  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1448) reduced to syllogistic logic i would say  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1451) yes yes and yeah for me what i found  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1455) very useful  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1456) was when i started to appreciate the  
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1459) flow of an argument and how things  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1461) how statements can connect what you can  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1463) infer or do  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1466) you could use it as a code in analyzing  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1468) for example your opponent's  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1470) argument as well for example many  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1472) atheists sometimes  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1473) come out with a hell of a lot of logical  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1475) fallacies concerning religion  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1477) or they infer things that shouldn't be  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1480) inferred  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1481) or they make statements that they can't  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1483) make by virtue of  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1485) you know the logical systems that we  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1487) both agree on  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1489) so it it enables you to understand right  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1492) they've made a statement but behind that  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1494) there is an assumption what is their  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1495) premise  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1496) right and there is an assumption behind  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1498) the premise we could unpack that  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1500) and so it's i think it is very important  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1502) to understand  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1503) things but this leads up to a very  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1505) important question actually which is  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1506) quite controversial in our tradition  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1508) um is what about you know is logic  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1511) anti-quran  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1512) yeah and could you even find some  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1517) forms of logical statements or logical  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1519) arguments  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1520) in the book of allah oh  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1523) now anyone who looks at our history  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1527) our intellectual history will know  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1529) obviously logic  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1531) is a contested science so meaning that  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1536) somewhat especially those who are also  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1538) inclined  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1539) like league of theoreticians  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1543) they didn't have time for monty they  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1544) just said this is this is not  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1546) necessary for um  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1551) deriving it's a foreign discipline  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1555) it's got no use for them so there  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1559) there was a there is a camp and the big  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1561) scholars in that camp  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1563) um you're looking at imam even salah for  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1565) example the great mohaddiv  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1567) obviously you've got as well islam even  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1570) tamiya  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1571) on that side who generally push back  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1573) against  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1574) greek logic although he wasn't against  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1576) logic per se  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1578) he just didn't like um  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1581) the way logic was being you know  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1583) inflated into like some big bad boy so  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1585) he  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1586) just he wanted to deflate that um  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1589) so yeah there's that cam and then you've  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1592) got  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1592) the hezeli camp um  
[0:26:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1596) sort of the more sort of rationally  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1598) inclined  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1600) i think hojo islam is an exception other  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1602) than  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1603) imam razali generally a lot of the the  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1606) the  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1606) the kalam incline scholars the muta  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1609) kalimun  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1610) they use logical arguments in or logic  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1614) in their dialectic  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1615) so they will put things in premises and  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1617) then say well if you say this then we  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1619) will reply  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1619) like this and you can't infer this from  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1622) that  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1622) so that their dialectic involved logic  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1630) takes logic i think to it to a different  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1632) level  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1633) now what he does is not only does he say  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1637) logic is valuable but he's saying  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1640) that the quran  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1643) has an un can exhibit an underlying  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1646) logical structure  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1648) in fact um the quran anywhere  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1651) we look in the quran we can see logical  
[0:27:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1653) syllogisms  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1654) at work and they're called the mizan he  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1657) calls him the mizan  
[0:27:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1659) and in other verses  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1675) yeah that's his gloss on it that's his  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1677) gloss on it so  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1678) he says it can't be scales to to weigh  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1680) barley and wheat and and rice  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1682) he goes nah there's more noble scale  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1685) than that for him  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1686) so it's the scales of logic  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1689) so for example i mean  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1693) um my mma dissertation was on this um  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1696) so if we take an example i think it's in  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1699) surat al baqarah  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1701) where allah subhanahu ta'ala talks about  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1705) i think the ibrahim given the proof  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1709) to um i think it's nimrod  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1713) about nimrod claimed to be a deity  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1719) so do you not so allah is asking his  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1722) prophet have you not looked at  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1724) the one who argued with ibrahim  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1726) regarding his lord nothing  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1736) is  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1738) said to nimrod look my lord is the one  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1740) who  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1741) who gives life and and so he gives life  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1744) and he takes his life  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1746) and the murder said well i can give life  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1748) and i can take life so he orders someone  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1749) to be killed you know  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1750) and then it spared someone's life sort  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1752) of thing  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1759) so he says my lord is the one who can  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1762) bring the sun  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1763) from the east so you bring it from the  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1766) west  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1767) then allah says  
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1771) then he was dumbfounded he knew he he  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1773) didn't have that power  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1774) so islam says that here we can put it  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1777) into a syllogism  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1778) so the syllogism goes something like  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1780) this  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1782) whoever has the power um  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1785) to bring the sun  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1789) from the west yeah then that person is  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1794) a deity he is god um  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1797) and then he says so if  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1801) um if i remember the premise correctly  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1803) so he says if  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1804) whoever can bring whoever can bring the  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1808) deity  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1809) let me just bring up because i think i'm  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1810) not doing it off the top of my head  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1811) properly so i think he's saying here  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1813) whoever can bring  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1814) whoever has the power over the sunrise  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1816) so that's the whoever power of the  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1817) sunrise that thing is god  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1820) um ibrahim's deity is something that has  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1822) power over the sunrise  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1824) therefore ibrahim's deity is god so for  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1826) all x  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1827) if x for any object if that object has  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1830) the power over sunrise  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1832) then that object is god ibrahim  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1835) al-islam's deity has  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1837) power over sunrise therefore ibrahim  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1839) al-islam's deity  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1840) is god so if p then q p the therefore q  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1844) that's hundreds of islam's inference  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1846) yeah that's his inference from  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1848) um uh if p then q p therefore q  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1852) so he says underlying the argument is  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1854) that logical structure  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1856) and then he goes on more and more and  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1857) more um  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1859) where he tries to fit quranic arguments  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1863) into illogistic form any of the  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1864) valid forms that aristotle had found  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1867) altogether i think there's 54  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1868) moods of the civilization 56 moves of  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1871) the syllogism  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1873) so yeah that's an example there and then  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1877) you know he gives lots and lots of  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1879) examples and this can be found in our  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1880) custard  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1882) now not everyone accepts this yeah  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1884) obviously not everyone accepts it  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1886) this is this is yeah this is it is a  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1888) controversial  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1889) um but you would  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1893) where everyone accepts the fact that you  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1895) that if you're going to basically  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1896) articulate something  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1898) and trying to prove something you have  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1899) to do in a way  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1901) that is logically valid meaning  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1904) yeah one statement leads to the next  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1907) conclusion  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1909) fine you don't have to basically have  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1910) this kind of you don't have to fall in  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1912) love with the aristotelian paradigm  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1915) and you know make it into this monster  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1917) but i think  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1918) even because when you read the works of  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1920) ibn tamiya may allah have mercy on him  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1923) you would see that he had an argument  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1924) like he had an argument against  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1926) the the the best of possible worlds  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1929) in the problem of evil in actual fact he  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1931) called al-ghazali's argument as well  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1933) they agreed on that issue  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1934) that this is the best possible world  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1936) that allah can create  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1937) um and he had another argument  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1939) concerning the problem of evil when he  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1941) was referring to allah's name and  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1943) attribute  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1944) that he is the wise but there is wisdom  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1946) behind these things so  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1948) he had an argument he thought that his  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1949) conclusion  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1951) was valid based upon all the other  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1954) justifications he made in the previous  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1956) statement that he made in his writing so  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1959) he may not have placed on him the same  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1961) so the thing is i don't think that  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1962) rejected the need to be able to  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1967) have an argument that flows properly  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1970) yeah  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1971) i don't think they disagreed with that i  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1973) think what you're trying to say here  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1975) kind of inflation of logic which even  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1978) tamir  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1979) uh tried to uh dismantle in his um  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1984) in uh book  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=1998) so yeah i want to be clear for the  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2001) audience so they don't think that  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2002) you know even the the the  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2006) anti-logic yeah what can we mean  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2009) they had to use certain principles or  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2011) logical principles  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2013) to derive rulings especially when they  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2014) did and other bits and pieces right  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2019) so yeah so we've got yeah so i'm not  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2021) trying to say that  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2022) um sorry islam is antithetical to logic  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2026) or those  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2027) who denied a sort of logic  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2030) primarily our society and stoic  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2032) abyssinian farabi and logic  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2035) that they weren't intellectual or they  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2036) were they were anti-irrational i'm not  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2038) saying that at all i'm just saying  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2039) the way uh islam has taken it to a  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2042) metaphysical plane  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2043) because now he's saying or we can infer  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2046) that  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2047) you've you've said now logic is the way  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2049) the divine  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2050) discourse is formed yeah you see there's  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2053) a big claim yeah  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2056) maybe yeah maybe people didn't want to  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2059) climb up that and that high  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2060) metaphysically absolutely so that was  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2062) very controversial for sure  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2064) uh but just for the audience saying  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2066) unique  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2068) for the sake of the live stream um you  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2071) know having an argument that flows  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2073) in a way that is valid is very important  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2076) when  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2077) when we're engaging in monado uh but  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2080) obviously  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2081) there's a huge camp of the olympia who  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2084) reacted the kind of metaphysical aspects  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2086) of logic  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2088) which is part of mainstream islam so  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2090) this leads now to  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2091) logical policy you talk about logical  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2093) fallacies in the book so what  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2095) is a logical fallacy and maybe give us  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2097) an example of some logical fallacies  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2102) um so in logic you know  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2106) so people can reason correctly in logic  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2109) you can reason correctly  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2110) um so you set out your your argument in  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2113) premises  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2114) and the conclusion follows from the  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2115) premises that's great  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2117) sometimes um the way you reason  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2121) the conclusion doesn't quite follow from  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2124) what you're saying  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2126) um so and that could be because of the  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2129) way you constructed your argument  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2131) so you think you can infer something  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2135) that but you can't given based on what  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2137) you've already claimed  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2138) so you've committed an error in  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2140) reasoning your reasoning isn't  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2143) correct and sound so fallacy just  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2145) basically is  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2146) um a mistaken belief or conclu  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2150) a mistaken inference you make for  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2152) something you've said or claimed  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2154) you think you can claim it uh infer it  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2156) but you can't  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2157) so fallacies then are those types of  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2159) arguments that  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2162) show a error an incorrect  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2165) um setting out of an argument  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2168) so that's very very important to know  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2172) because i need to know when i'm making  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2174) an argument have i committed a fallacy  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2176) because if i have then i can't that  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2178) argument i need to change it  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2180) um yes similarly i need to point out to  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2183) my opponent that if she has used  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2185) a fallacy then she may not be aware  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2189) um i need to alert her to her fallacious  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2192) reasoning um because at the end of the  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2194) day remember we're trying to reach  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2195) truth it's not haha i picked a fault in  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2197) your argument  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2199) yes and you definitely my argument and  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2201) we're just going to bruise each other's  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2203) egos there's nothing to do with that  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2205) bottom line it's about seeking truth  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2208) so you can't reach truth by an error in  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2211) reasoning  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2212) you can't reach the truth through an  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2213) error in reasoning  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2215) so so that's why in arabic we call  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2217) fallacies  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2220) you made that you made a a mistake in  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2222) your reasoning  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2224) and there are tons of fallacies um  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2226) [Music]  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2231) some fallacies sorry there's a bit of a  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2233) delay for that so i do apologize  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2235) so some fallacies  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2238) are not fallacies if you apply them  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2241) correctly  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2242) like for example before you give us some  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2244) examples but one that comes to mind is  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2246) you know the argument from contingency  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2248) or the argument from dependent  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2250) some uh interlocutors or atheists or  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2254) or skeptics they say oh you've committed  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2257) the fallacy of composition and the  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2259) fallacy of composition is a error in  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2261) reason where you think  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2262) the whole has to have the same  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2264) attributes as its part  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2266) so they would say that's a policies  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2269) because given example of the fallacy  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2272) um the persian rug is heavy in weight  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2276) but its individual threads are light in  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2278) weight  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2279) so just because the individual threads  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2282) are light in weight  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2283) you can't now infer that the whole  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2285) persian rug is light in weight so that's  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2288) however you have to be careful how you  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2290) apply that fallacy because it's not  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2292) always the case that it's a phallic  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2294) for example a brick wall a brick wall is  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2297) hard  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2298) and its individual parts bricks are also  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2300) hard so you can say  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2302) the individual brick by hard make up a  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2304) hard wall  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2305) so the hole will have the attribute of  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2308) its  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2308) individual car and with the specific to  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2312) the argument from contingency  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2314) you can't apply this fallacy to the  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2315) argument continue because  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2317) of the principle of dependency or the  
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2319) principle of contingency that contingent  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2321) things always make up contingent holds  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2325) from that point of view so and  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2328) yeah you're right there's a lot of  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2330) fallacies but they get  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2331) also complicated to the point where  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2333) sometimes they're applied and sometimes  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2335) they're not so give us some other  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2336) examples what  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2338) your example just shows the need while  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2340) we need to study fallacies so we use  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2341) that if we're applying  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2342) if i accuse my inner debate in islam in  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2345) islamic  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2346) in bathroom another like if i accuse my  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2348) opponent or something  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2349) i can't just throw out a flimsy  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2351) accusation or that that's a fallacious  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2353) argument  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2353) i i better you know i better bring my  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2356) evidence  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2357) if i'm misunderstanding fallacies  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2360) then i'm making a false accusation  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2361) against my debate opponent can you see  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2364) we don't have to do that so that reaches  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2366) the etiquette debate  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2367) so we've got to be very very careful in  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2369) how we do that yeah i mean there are  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2371) tons  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2371) in the book i tried to put some examples  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2374) maybe i'll mention a couple  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2375) where i don't often find these fallacies  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2377) being  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2378) studied or mentioned so they get off the  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2380) radar  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2382) but i think they're quite important um  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2384) and sometimes we may fall prey to them  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2386) or some people  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2387) may use it against us and then we're  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2389) scratching your head thinking that  
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2390) sounded right  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2392) but you know what you go back and you  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2393) think and you think uh how did i not get  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2395) that  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2396) um so i mean for example there's one  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2399) the one that's called the fallacy of  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2401) appeal to accomplishment  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2403) so the form goes something like this  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2406) p something is true p is true because  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2409) the person  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2410) making the claim has an impeccable  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2413) record or accomplished record therefore  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2416) p is true  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2417) so someone may say to you look i've got  
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2420) a phd  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2421) i've got so many jazzers to teach so  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2424) believe me when i tell you yeah  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2426) there's no contradiction between this  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2428) and that well believe me if you know  
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2430) islam is compatible with this or islam  
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2432) is compatible with that  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2434) okay but truth is not dependent on  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2438) the accomplishment of someone otherwise  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2440) we would have to say  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2442) someone more accomplished than the  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2443) person making that argument will be even  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2445) truer  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2446) yes so it doesn't really matter  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2450) i'm not demeaning ejazza i'm not for our  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2452) audience please don't mistake we're  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2454) talking about logic here we're talking  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2455) about strictly what can follow from what  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2457) you may have a bundle of ejazzers it  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2460) doesn't make  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2460) your claim about something true yes  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2464) because someone will come along and say  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2466) i have 10 to the power of two e jazzers  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2469) yeah so therefore i'm truer than you in  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2471) what i claim  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2473) but truth has to be independently  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2476) established and verified through  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2477) evidence  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2479) so that's called the appeal to  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2480) accomplishment um  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2482) and people try and you've got to  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2483) remember this and the quran points this  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2485) out beautifully fallacies are used  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2487) in a performance to to shut out the  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2490) opponent's argument  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2492) that's what fallacies are used for to  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2494) shut out  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2495) all the debate so it's it has a it has a  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2498) adverse pragmatic function yes  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2502) and allah recalls these fallacies in the  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2504) quran in many many places  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2507) another thing is this um appeal what  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2510) they call appeal to consequence  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2512) um something is um uh  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2515) you could say some belief  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2519) or something has negative consequences  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2521) therefore that thing is false  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2523) or you can do the opposite and say  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2525) something has positive consequences  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2527) therefore that thing is true  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2529) so you're pegging truth and falsity  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2532) on mere consequences um  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2536) so so i know someone might say um  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2540) look at all the youth and muslim youth  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2542) out there who don't  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2543) live a hedonistic lifestyle you're  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2545) robbing them of so much  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2547) enjoyment and fun and whatever it is  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2550) yeah  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2551) therefore you know living by your  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2554) religious rules and guidance  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2556) that must be false um but that's clearly  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2559) fallacious  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2560) you can't play truth on the mere  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2563) consequences of something  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2565) um because we can get lots of a lot of  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2569) a lot of yeah they say oh  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2572) no the crime says this it's bad  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2575) therefore it's wrong  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2576) right so number one is a logical policy  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2579) but also  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2580) we could under we could unpack their  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2582) premise well  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2585) according to whose framework is that bad  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2588) how do you define bad right or into what  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2591) normative  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2592) theory what is your method what's your  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2594) normal theory to even make that judgment  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2596) so that's why it's very important you  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2598) mentioned it's not important for people  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2599) to understand that  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2600) when people make these emote because  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2601) remember logical fallacies have  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2603) emotional  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2604) uh content  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2608) you don't even have a phd yet who are  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2610) you so-and-so you don't even know arabic  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2612) or who are you so so you don't know this  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2614) now in in certain contexts that might  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2616) make sense for what you don't know  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2617) arabic and you're claiming to be  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2619) an expert in tafsir exegesis then we  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2621) have a problem  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2622) so again it's applied but generally  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2624) speaking if you if you're discussing  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2625) about a topic that  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2627) you know you have some expertise over  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2628) someone's saying oh you don't have this  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2630) therefore you're wrong  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2632) that's that's fallacious so and they all  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2634) have emotional content and that's right  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2635) in a debate you have to be very clear of  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2637) your emotions  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2638) like reminds what bruce said about when  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2640) you're ready to fight he said you have  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2642) to be ego less like a wooden doll  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2645) just allow the limbs to work themselves  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2647) don't get emotional because if you have  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2648) too much emotional content  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2650) you won't be able to address the logical  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2652) fantasy because  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2654) you've just been the the emotion has  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2656) been imposed on you you don't realize  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2657) that actually there's an error in their  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2659) reasoning so yeah that's brilliant i'll  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2662) give you one more  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2664) question yeah and this is called the  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2666) fallacy of inflation of conflict  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2668) um i don't want to mention um a recent  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2672) example  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2672) but you know i'm sure our viewers can  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2675) make the connection  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2676) the inflation of conflict fallacy says  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2678) that imagine you have authority person a  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2681) an authority person b they are they  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2683) differ over some  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2685) claim or proposition we and then the  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2688) person infers that therefore  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2690) we cannot say anything certain or  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2692) meaningful about  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2693) p so person a and person b differ over p  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2697) therefore we cannot say anything certain  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2699) or meaningful about p  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2700) now the reason why that's gracious is  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2703) because we cannot make that inference  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2704) all we can say is  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2706) person a and b differ over p that's all  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2709) we can say  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2709) we cannot infer that there's nothing  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2711) more meaningful to say or nothing more  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2713) certain to say  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2714) so if two or lamar differ over a  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2717) particular  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2718) issue um it doesn't mean therefore the  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2721) whole subject matter is in dispute or  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2725) there's nothing certain in that subject  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2727) area all it says is that two scholars  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2730) disagreed  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2732) that's the extent of the claim that we  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2733) can make so  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2735) unfortunately a lot of a lot of muslims  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2737) i see that  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2738) they commit that inflation of conflict  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2740) fallacy just because two giant scholars  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2742) disagreed about something  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2743) therefore the whole subject matter  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2744) they're talking about what issue is so  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2746) uncertain  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2747) and that's not clear can you see you  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2749) know what you should say  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2751) what you should do is maybe do a youtube  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2752) video on like the  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2754) top 30 logical fallacies on muslims  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2757) social media  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2758) you know people's reactions to things oh  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2760) this looks like this we've got to say  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2761) that and you could we could  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2763) basically do like apply the logical  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2765) fallacy to these reactions  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2767) but here okay good so the next question  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2769) is a very important question uh  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2771) doctor so what are the etiquettes of  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2774) debates  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2775) in the islamic tradition so give us an  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2777) overview  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2778) tickets of debating of munabhara in the  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2780) islamic tradition  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2783) i mean there are so many and  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2790) when one you know  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2795) has to be looked at as an act of worship  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2798) um  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2798) because you're seeking the truth um so  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2802) um it also falls under actually  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2805) you know commanding right forbidding  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2807) wrong because that what falls under that  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2809) so your argumentation should fall into  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2811) your  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2812) program of darwin essentially  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2815) so anyway so so bearing that in mind we  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2818) have to have that  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2819) there cannot be any inappropriate  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2821) behavior in a debate we can't become  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2823) angry infuriated agitated lose our  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2826) composure  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2827) shout um flail you know gesticulate  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2831) you you know like that um  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2836) because we're gonna lose focus on  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2837) remember the focus is we're arguing to  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2839) attain the truth  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2842) not to throw a barney at someone where  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2845) we're just we want to focus on the truth  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2847) so um the first etiquette debate  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2851) at one etiquette debate is that we  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2854) shouldn't  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2854) um we shouldn't make assumptions about  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2857) the person we're debating  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2859) um we mustn't assume the person has ill  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2863) intentions  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2864) um uh we shouldn't assume  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2868) that they're out with some kind of sub  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2871) unless we have reasons to obviously  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2872) there are always exceptions right unless  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2874) we have reason to the default is  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2877) you have good opinion of your intel your  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2879) your debate partner  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2881) um and you you know you have the  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2884) intention to draw nearer to allah  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2887) and you always want to give a good  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2888) opinion of them  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2890) so that's that's the second etiquette  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2893) debate  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2894) another etiquette debate is um not to  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2897) debate  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2898) in inappropriate places so we shouldn't  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2902) conduct debates in intimidating places  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2906) um like maybe we invite someone to  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2909) debate and then we want the audience to  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2912) you know bae for blood  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2915) you know um that kind of thing or we  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2918) shouldn't be debating in  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2919) areas where we may get overwhelmed  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2922) like overcome with fear um  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2926) yeah so we need to avoid places like  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2928) that places that aren't safe  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2930) um and places in effect really  
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2933) for any platform or place that doesn't  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2936) allow you to  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2937) achieve your aim again which is the  
[0:48:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2939) truth  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2941) so not in a not in a so any place that's  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2944) considered inappropriate as if it bars  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2946) you from  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2946) reaching the truth the other etiquette  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2948) of debate is to debate your peers  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2950) generally  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2951) i know you you debated obviously  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2953) professor kraft and that was the first  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2955) time it was done  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2956) and i think there was a milestone  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2959) but generally um we should be cognizant  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2962) of who we're debating we shouldn't  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2963) debate  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2964) like like a high school per high school  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2966) kid and we're adults  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2968) yes generally peers are like  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2970) intellectual peers  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2972) um we should avoid debating  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2975) people who are considered yani  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2978) respectful and dignified like and we you  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2981) know we come along  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2982) and try and you know  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2986) agitate them for a debate we should we  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2989) ought not to do that  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2990) we ought not to we want to keep within  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2992) our our peer  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2993) um so so there's a so in order to do  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2995) that we have a rightful and appropriate  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2997) level of engagement  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=2998) yes we must have patience and diligence  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3002) we have to have a suburb we cannot lose  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3004) patience in the debate  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3006) um because at the end of the day however  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3009) long the debate partner takes to make  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3011) the claim  
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3011) you have to sit patiently yes  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3014) unless you set a time and whatever it is  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3016) you know unless you have logistical  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3018) agreements but  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3019) you must have patience and and bear  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3023) out what your opponent is saying you  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3025) cannot  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3026) um you know lose it basically  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3030) so we need to be respectful kind we  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3032) shouldn't interrupt  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3033) that's a big thing um we are not allowed  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3037) to interrupt our debate partner  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3039) can't cut them off they have to finish  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3041) making their point or their  
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3042) clarification or their claim  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3044) or their premise or their proposition um  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3047) and we have to wait till they finish  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3050) yeah  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3050) and then the list goes on and on and on  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3058) yeah in your view would this be applied  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3061) to debates  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3062) with non-muslim interlocutors as well  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3068) it's across the board there's no when  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3070) the undermine talk about it it is not  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3073) they don't specify that it's just a  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3074) believer  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3076) okay not a muslim with muslim debating  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3079) in fact  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3080) it's anyone who's your debate partner  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3082) your debate opponent  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3084) um so can't insult each other  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3087) unfortunately  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3088) i've seen some clips even recently  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3091) respectable  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3092) scholars insulting each other um  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3096) you know you know how it is  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3099) you know you yeah i'm sure you've seen  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3102) and heard it yourself  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3104) absolutely absolutely okay i'm going to  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3106) advise people to go to that relevant  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3108) section the etiquettes of debate in the  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3110) islamic tradition  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3111) it talks about that aspect in the book  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3113) so the next  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3114) thing is you also talk about quranic  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3117) method of argumentation the prophetic  
[0:52:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3120) method of argumentation  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3123) what what are you talking about what is  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3125) the quranic method of argumentation  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3127) what is this the the sunnah of  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3129) argumentation the prophetic methodology  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3131) and and give us some examples okay  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3134) um the quranic discourse  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3138) in the quranic discourse how the quran  
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3142) models argumentation how it gives  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3145) examples of argumentation  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3147) is very different from  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3150) a philosophical type of argumentation  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3152) but i'll come i'll mention that a bit  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3154) later but let me mention some of the  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3155) features of  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3156) what i think are the quranic  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3157) argumentation  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3159) um we have to remember by the way  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3161) quranic argumentation  
[0:52:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3163) is part of the jazz of the quran because  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3166) it's coined in the arabic language  
[0:52:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3168) interesting so so you know  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3172) if language is what grounds or quran's  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3174) inimitability and you've written  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3175) extensively on that  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3178) and argumentation is based on the  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3180) language then it's part of the  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3181) inimitability  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3183) uh the other feature of the chronic  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3185) argumentation is it appeals to  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3188) um both the intellect and the emotions  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3192) and i think sometimes you mentioned in  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3193) your talks that an ayah  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3196) is supposed is you know is supposed to  
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3198) just activate  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3200) in you um you know  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3203) your sense of awe and wonder  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3210) so arguments are aimed at hitting that  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3212) as well not just our thinking  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3214) but to awaken that war in us  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3217) so the chronic argumentations are  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3220) addressing  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3220) the human person holistically it's not  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3224) just a  
[0:53:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3224) rational thing it's addressing our  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3227) emotions  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3228) our fear our hopes our longing our  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3230) desires and things like that  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3233) the quran uses evidence is based on what  
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3237) is  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3238) on sense perception of what is sensible  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3241) um it doesn't base premises or claims on  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3245) wild guesses speculate  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3248) far-fetched convoluted examples um  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3252) so everything is grounded in a claim  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3255) that can be traced back  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3257) and verified through the senses  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3260) so that's another feature of the chronic  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3262) argumentation there's no contrived  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3264) artificial language it's all  
[0:54:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3267) couched in beautiful eloquent heart you  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3270) know  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3271) pulling at the heart so allah uses that  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3274) kind of language  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3276) um the other stuff the other sort of  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3280) feature of the quranic argumentation is  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3282) um  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3283) the quran always gives justifications it  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3286) gets you to think  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3289) why allah when allah makes a claim he's  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3291) grounding acclaim  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3292) um they're not groundless  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3296) um and so things like that and then the  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3299) quran uses different  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3300) styles for his argument sometimes it's  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3303) polemical and hard hitting  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3306) so like warnings um  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3310) sometimes it's persuasive it's trying to  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3311) convince you  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3313) it's using you know if you want to use  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3315) that outstanding language  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3316) of ethos logos pathos and all that kind  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3318) of stuff so it's using  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3320) persuasive language other times it uses  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3323) a legal language  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3325) other times it just narrates using uses  
[0:55:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3327) narration or style  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3329) so there's so many different styles in  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3332) the quran  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3333) so you mentioned  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3337) an example for example to use an example  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3340) if we look at for example um  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3344) let me just think uh what i can think  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3346) that would be an easy one  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3349) so uh allah subhanallahu ta'ala gets  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3352) us here's one a feature of chronic  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3356) argumentation  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3356) is allah makes us see allah wants to  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3360) make  
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3362) to expose the contradiction in the  
[0:56:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3363) opponent's view  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3365) so for example when the the the  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3368) the mushrik the mushipoon arab times  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3371) they  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3372) they their faces used to go black when  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3375) they had a daughter born  
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3378) when they had a daughter born the faces  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3380) used to go dark black out of shame  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3382) and we know what their heinous practice  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3385) was  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3386) bringing alive you know newborn  
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3389) daughters like that  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3390) um it's infanticide and allah says okay  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3394) you don't like girls you don't like  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3396) females  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3397) you kill him so backwards  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3400) and barbaric but yet you have you don't  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3403) see it as a problem  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3404) that you attribute daughters to allah  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3409) allah has no problems in the sense of  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3411) it's not allah is having a problem with  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3412) females it's not that  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3414) it's based on your own logic and your  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3416) own your own viewpoint you don't like  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3418) anything female but yet you find it  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3421) dignified enough to attribute it to  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3423) your deity so allah exposes it yeah  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3427) the inconsistency and i think  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3430) very profound doctor because the quran  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3433) in its statements and arguments are just  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3435) very multi-layered because on one  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3438) area it's like an ayah is like a diamond  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3442) and where you put the light it has a  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3444) different reaction  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3446) so you know take for example when allah  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3449) talks about  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3450) uh in in sort of 52 verse 35 to 36  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3454) when allah says did you come from  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3455) nothing you create yourself do you  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3456) create the heavens  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3460) you have no certainty now that primarily  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3462) can be used as a psychoemotive point to  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3465) awaken what is intuitive  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3467) so some argue that's part of the fitra  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3470) but  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3471) also there's an underlying powerful  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3473) argument behind that  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3474) concerning things that are things that  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3477) come into being  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3479) could they come from nothing could they  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3480) create themselves could they be created  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3482) by something else created or is an  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3483) uncreated creator  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3485) so you could have a rat no powerful  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3486) argument on one hand  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3489) but the same verses can also have a  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3491) psycho emotive  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3494) function to bring out what is naturally  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3497) within us which is what allah is the  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3499) reality and his worthy of extensive  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3500) praise absolutely  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3502) absolutely so right you also talk about  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3505) the prophetic methodology  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3507) of argumentation so what is that and  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3509) give us some as well  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3512) so that yeah so the prophetic argument  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3514) it does overlap with the quranic  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3516) argument but what i was trying to say  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3518) there  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3518) i think there is a sunnah methodology in  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3521) argumentation  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3522) um so the prophet when he's delivering  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3525) the truth  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3526) he uses so some of the features of how  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3529) the prophet used to argue  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3532) um he used to use one the most eloquent  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3535) language  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3536) he was the most eloquent arab of course  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3538) without a doubt so his arguments were  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3539) always couched in  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3541) the most beautiful in an eloquent and  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3544) respectful way  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3546) respectful terms um  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3549) he he he would use some of the most sort  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3552) of  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3553) penetrative examples  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3556) when he's using when he's in debate he'd  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3559) try and you'd use the strongest proof  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3561) to establish the claim um  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3565) so but you've got to remember his  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3566) arguments were arguments  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3568) aimed at being transformative  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3573) not aimed at me giving you propositional  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3575) knowledge can you see  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3577) his aim was he's got to transform  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3579) because he's bringing guidance he's  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3581) trying to transform human lectures and  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3582) i've come to talk about the fitra  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3584) hopefully in just a bit um never do you  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3587) find him in the sunnah  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3588) argumentation merely for sport  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3592) or quarreling or dueling  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3597) you know just for no purpose at all  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3601) argumentation the prophet used was to  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3604) to awaken general realization in human  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3607) beings  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3608) the arguments were never complicated or  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3610) confounded the prophet  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3613) ever sat down and made an argument to  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3615) the companions or to his  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3617) debate opponents like mushy corn and  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3618) they said who  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3620) muhammad what are you saying that's so  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3622) convoluted  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3623) it was always simple it was never  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3625) abstract and disconnected from reality  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3628) can you see so  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3631) so yeah so the prophet would use that  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3634) obviously his  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3635) argumentations were linked with the  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3636) quran because he used to wait for  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3638) revelation to come down  
[1:00:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3641) so one example is the example for  
[1:00:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3643) example of isa ali  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3644) salam where the delegation from nagaland  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3647) came to the prophet  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3648) and they were discussing and debating  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3651) many issues and one of the issues that  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3652) cropped up was  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3654) the nature of isa alaihissalam and they  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3657) were saying to the prophet were muslim  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3658) before you even came  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3660) um and the prophet said no that's not  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3662) true based on what you said  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3664) your claim is that you say jesus is  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3667) um and then the argument they bring as  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3670) we told in the probably  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3671) and the syrup hashem even others like  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3674) that  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3675) that you know they claim that you know  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3677) islam what makes him unique is that you  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3679) know he was born  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3680) from singapore from a single from a  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3682) mother only  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3684) um but if that is the case so the  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3687) prophet waited for the response  
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3688) you know if that is the case then surely  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3691) if you think that's weird let me give  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3692) you something even  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3693) stranger what would you say in the case  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3696) of someone who had no parentage  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3698) on your logic remember this is not the  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3700) quran is not making this claim a lot the  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3702) prophet is not making this claim  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3703) this based on the claim that the um  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3707) the christian delegation from najib made  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3709) you are claiming someone's divinity  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3710) based on the fact that they were born  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3712) without one  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3713) biological parent but what if i give you  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3715) the example of someone who's born about  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3717) no biological parents so things like  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3720) that  
[1:02:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3721) and and you know so and there's many  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3724) many  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3725) many many i know we haven't got time to  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3726) go through the process but  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3729) the whole time yeah so the whole point  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3732) of this to encourage people to actually  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3735) uh get the book as well you can get it  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3737) off

[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3745) you're going to get involved in these  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3746) things  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3747) please learn about logical fallacies  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3750) different  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3750) uh types of logic learn about the  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3752) chronic methodology of argumentation  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3755) the prophet prophetic methodology of  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3757) argumentation learn about the etiquettes  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3759) of  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3759) monad and discussion and debate and so  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3762) on and so forth so this leads us to our  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3764) final question ultimate question i've  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3767) got two more questions  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3768) one the penultimate question is what is  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3771) the difference between  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3772) quranic argument and philosophical  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3774) argument  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3777) the difference between quranic argument  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3779) and philosophical  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3782) yeah now after everything i just said  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3785) about logic  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3786) yeah i'm i'm not dismissing logic at all  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3789) um i know we've encouraged it today um  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3792) for those who are working  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3794) to do to study logic for the reasons we  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3796) mentioned earlier  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3798) um but but there is a difference between  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3802) how the quran presents arguments and how  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3804) a philosopher  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3805) presents arguments um the quran  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3808) is based on natural language whereas  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3812) whereas philosophers logicians use an  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3814) artificial language i know you mentioned  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3816) earlier about free m a  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3817) you have to study the squiggly lines and  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3819) the symbols and things like that  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3820) there's no artificial language in the  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3822) quran is natural language  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3825) the quranic arguments are often informal  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3828) um they're not set out formally in a in  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3831) in a logically structured way whereas  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3835) the philosopher philosophical arguments  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3837) are set out in a formal way  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3839) um the quranic arguments are based on  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3842) what you can sense and perceive  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3844) what the mind can grasp but philosophers  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3846) arguments can be about the metaphysical  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3848) the meta-metaphysical you know the hype  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3852) because yeah you know um  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3855) the chronic arguments are for everyone  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3858) because it's  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3859) a guidance for all humankind so it has  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3861) to be addressed  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3863) be understood at every level whereas  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3864) philosophical arguments are only known  
[1:04:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3866) by specialists  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3867) [Music]  
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3869) those who know logic philosophy whatever  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3870) theology and things like that  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3872) the quranic arguments are very simple  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3876) non-technical they're not abstract  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3878) whereas  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3879) we know philosophical arguments can be  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3880) complex and  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3882) technical and abstract we know that um  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3885) but here's one that's very unique in  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3887) quranic argumentation  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3888) the quran has come to agitate the fitra  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3894) the quran has come to agitate now  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3898) often it does that by generating  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3900) vulnerability in us  
[1:05:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3902) reminding us of our limitedness how  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3904) needy we are how weak  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3905) how finite we are so that vulnerability  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3909) gets us to think  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3910) well something greater than me i'm so  
[1:05:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3913) i'm so weak and powerless  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3915) so there must be something greater than  
[1:05:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3916) me and yeah the occult camp player  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3918) plays a role in telling us what is now  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3920) the word object worthy of worship  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3922) but the quran has come to hit that fit  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3924) and to ignite it awake  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3927) because it could be dormant for most of  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3929) us it could be you know for a lot of  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3930) people it's dormant  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3931) needs agitating philosophers don't do  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3933) that  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3935) philosophical arguments don't hit your  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3937) fit i mean i i  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3938) you know you've studied philosophy  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3940) you've you know you've read philosophy  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3942) books back to front  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3943) i mean how many of them sort of really  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3946) when they're formal and technical  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3948) banger i don't know  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3952) yeah they're not transformative they  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3954) don't agitate  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3955) pedagogical yeah yeah they absolutely  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3958) the the and that's the power of the  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3961) quran  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3963) the arguments are simple yet profound  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3965) yeah  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3967) it's formative so we're not saying logic  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3971) doesn't have we just mentioned the  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3972) importance of logic  
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3973) earlier but we're saying that the  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3975) methodology of the quran is different  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3977) because it's about idea now um  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3980) but the logic is the tool um that can  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3982) help passing uncovering  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3984) in some formal ways or with clarity what  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3987) is already within the chronic discourse  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3989) and there are other differences but i  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3990) thought i mentioned those um yeah  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3992) so anyone who feels they don't get logic  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3994) or they're not studying it not to feel  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3997) that they can't access the quranic  
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=3999) message  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4001) the best arguments are fundamentally the  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4003) arguments of the book of allah subhanahu  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4005) wa ta'ala  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4006) so that is a given i think another thing  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4008) which is very interesting is always  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4010) the quran and you mentioned that earlier  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4012) the quran uses premises  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4015) that are not for example abstract and  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4017) cannot be  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4019) justified whereas the quran uses  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4022) premises that can be offensible they can  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4025) be sensed and they can be  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4026) easily unpacked or easily understood  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4030) whereas in philosophical language or in  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4032) philosophical arguments  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4034) you may need certain premises you need  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4037) another thousand arguments just to  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4039) justify your premise  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4042) so yeah absolutely imagine imagine if  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4045) you say to someone  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4046) in some possible world p there is some  
[1:07:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4049) person who lives there and he eats  
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4051) vegetables and already you've lost them  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4054) that is an abstract possible word it's  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4055) got nothing to do with anyone we don't  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4057) even know how that world is it's just a  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4058) mere  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4060) you know it reminds me of the  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4063) zombie argument uh when they talk about  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4066) the philosophy of the mind  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4068) yeah you imagine yeah  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4072) so yeah hamdulillah so we've  
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4076) done i think more than an hour now so  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4077) final question what is your  
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4079) word advice to the active to those who  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4082) engage in islamic outreach those who  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4084) want to intellectually academically uh  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4088) share islam and defenders  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4092) first of all the advice is to myself uh  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4094) before it's to anyone and i'm i'm  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4096) lying i say this uh if anyone knows me  
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4099) i'm the one who need  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4100) most of advice i would say this um  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4104) in the context of what we've just been  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4105) talking about we need to check  
[1:08:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4107) our sincerity that's the first thing our  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4110) iklas  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4110) where is it so on our last meetup where  
[1:08:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4113) are we  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4114) what's up you know we want we want a  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4116) good taqwa footprint  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4118) so we need to check our icloud  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4121) am i debating am i discussing what is it  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4124) for is it  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4124) because you know the audience are going  
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4128) to like me  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4129) the audience is what the audience want  
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4131) um is it because  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4133) it makes me feel good and gratified you  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4136) know  
[1:08:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4136) i like to humiliate people whatever  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4138) whatever it is i'm not making  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4139) accusations against anyone i'm just  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4141) saying generically  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4143) if our intentions are not right if it's  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4145) not purely  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4146) to to seek the truth as a as a  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4150) as a means and seek the truth into means  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4151) of drawing nearer to allah  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4153) then we're probably not debating on the  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4156) right grounds or discussing or  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4158) arguing on the right grounds so  
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4162) how is must be put in place  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4165) the other thing i would say is um  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4170) we should avoid debating um unless we  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4174) have to  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4176) we should avoid debating debating  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4178) shouldn't be a habit  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4180) um it shouldn't be something we clock up  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4184) like we got debate mileage  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4187) it it should be part of our data  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4190) our program and used where necessary  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4193) yes because that's how we're going to  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4194) deliver the truth obviously with the  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4196) best possible decorum but deliver it  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4198) through argumentation dialogue  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4200) discussion and so on doesn't have to  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4201) just be argument but dialogue and  
[1:10:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4202) discussion as well  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4204) so we need to avoid it unless we need to  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4207) employ it  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4208) in our strategy of da'wah to show the  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4210) intellectual  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4211) side of islam the strength of the  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4213) islamic  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4214) soul um the final piece of advice i'd  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4218) say is  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4219) if we are going to be debating and  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4221) discussing and dialoguing  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4223) not to turn it inwards in a in a in a  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4227) in a detrimental way what i seem to  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4229) sense now me personally is that we're  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4231) going inwards  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4233) destructively destructively  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4237) and and the worst thing is it's for  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4240) everyone to see  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4242) i know you've made some comments about  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4244) something before and i think you know  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4247) advice from yourself is going to be  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4249) important for  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4250) thousands and thousands of people who  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4251) are probably want to pick up a camera  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4255) and go somewhere and debate and record  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4257) it and show it to someone  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4259) and you know get gratified by it  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4261) whatever it is  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4263) but we seem to be turning inwards  
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4264) without within ourselves and without any  
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4267) adap yes we're shooting  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4271) we're firing at each other we're  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4273) scattering bullets at each other without  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4275) any adam  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4277) so that needs to that i think we need to  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4279) pull the brakes on that  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4281) um because we're insulting each other  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4284) we're attacking each other we're making  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4285) it personal we're insulting  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4287) we're breaking all the ada  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4291) so i would so reminded to myself we need  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4293) to check our sincerity  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4295) are we doing it to seek the truth and  
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4296) draw nearer to allah is  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4298) it part of our strategy to take islam  
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4302) intellectually to the people but with  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4304) the best decorum  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4306) and are we avoiding are we doing  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4308) debating  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4310) you know by lobbying grenades within our  
[1:11:52](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4312) each of our camps  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4314) um you know we're we're we're imploding  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4317) internally within ourselves  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4319) and that's destructive that's actually  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4322) in the book  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4323) i mention examples of that is  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4336) and this is why they should read it and  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4337) study it because  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4339) it would solve a lot of our issues

[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4343) and it will be closer to the islamic  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4344) tradition and how we should basically  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4346) engage in monarch in debates and  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4348) discussions  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4350) it has to be done with sincerity and

[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4367) in the future we could actually unpack  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/VgFH2Qr7WP0?t=4369) certain key concepts together
