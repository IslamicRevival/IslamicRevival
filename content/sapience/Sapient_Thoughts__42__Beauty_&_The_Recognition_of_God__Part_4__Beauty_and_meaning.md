[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=19) thoughts  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=20) where we discuss theo philosophical  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=22) issues where we  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=24) answer contentions against islam  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=27) and where we provide a robust case for  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=29) the veracity of islam  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=31) in today's episode which is one of a  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=33) multiple multi-part series  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=35) on the topic of beauty and the  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=37) recognition of god  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=39) we are going to be continuing our  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=41) discussion  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=42) from the last episode so if you remember  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=44) from the last episode we had given  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=46) a conceptualization of beauty and now  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=49) what we want to do in today's episode  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=51) is that we are going to look at how  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=53) beauty is connected to meaning  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=55) in various scenarios and where we  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=58) experience beauty  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=59) so let me start with when we're talking  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=63) about  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=64) beauty being connected to meaning what  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=66) we're saying here is that beauty is  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=68) connected to meaning in the sense that  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=70) it's giving you something  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=71) deeper than a surface meaning  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=74) okay so let's take and let's compare  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=77) two types of interests you have an  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=80) aesthetic interest and a utilitarian  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=82) interest  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=83) right now what does that mean let's give  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=85) an example to to elucidate the point  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=88) when a person sets a table for some  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=91) guests  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=92) now someone could quote unquote set a  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=95) table  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=96) by putting some paper plates on the  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=98) table  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=99) and some plastic utensils and  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=102) you know and and that's it that's  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=104) they've set the table  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=106) now this is one setting of a table which  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=108) one could say is quite utilitarian  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=110) it's based on a the utilization  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=114) of the plate in the sense that there is  
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=116) a practical value of the plate  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=118) the plate is there someone takes it they  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=120) take food and we're done  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=122) now compare that to someone who sets the  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=124) table  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=126) by way of beautifying it so there is an  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=128) aesthetic interest here  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=130) and so when someone sets the table with  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=133) a very nice tablecloth  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=135) they add to it you know candles to the  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=137) table and they would have  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=139) napkins that are cloth based and wrapped  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=141) and put on the plates  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=142) the plates have been set and they're  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=144) china plates and  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=146) utensils real utensils on table mats  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=149) that are  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=149) that have a design on them and when you  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=152) look at this particular setup of the  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=153) dining table  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=155) you see that there's a beauty to it  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=158) this beauty transcends the mere utility  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=162) of just  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=162) having plates and having utensils so  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=165) what we can say is that  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=167) that additional element of beauty is  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=170) connected with some sort of meaning  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=171) in the sense that when the host sets the  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=173) table like that  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=175) it could be pointing towards something  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=177) beyond just  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=178) the host wants you to eat it could be  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=180) that the host  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=181) values the the the the participant or  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=185) the guest that's coming over  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=186) and therefore they took out time to  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=188) beautify because remember  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=190) beauty is something that pleases us not  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=192) in a sensual way  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=194) but there is an aspect of beauty that  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=196) pleases the person  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=197) so the meaning here could be about the  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=200) host  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=201) or it could also say something about the  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=203) guest or the value of the guest  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=205) right and so there's a meaning that goes  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=207) beyond just the utilitarian interest  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=210) there's an aesthetic interest here and  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=212) that points to a meaning that's deeper  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=214) than the surface level  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=215) utility of plates and utensils  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=218) now we could also  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=222) talk about beauty being connected to  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=224) meaning meaning it points to something  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=225) deeper  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=226) than a surface level meaning when we  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=228) talk about arts and entertainment  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=231) so something that is entertaining  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=234) would have a kind of surface level  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=236) pleasure  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=237) so when you watch a movie that is just  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=239) merely entertaining  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=240) you you know you watch it you enjoy it  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=243) and then that's it you're finished  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=245) but when it comes to something that is  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=247) related to art  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=249) it not only has this idea of you being  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=253) entertained for a short amount of time  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=255) but it allows a person or perhaps causes  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=258) a person  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=259) to think deeply so for instance you know  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=262) if  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=262) if if you're a movie buff there may be  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=265) certain movies that  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=267) are just there to entertain there may be  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=268) you know some sort of fleeting action  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=270) movies where you  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=271) watch the movie you're entertained for  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=273) the duration the movie and that's pretty  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=274) much it you're not really thinking much  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=276) about  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=276) the the meaning behind you know uh you  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=279) know something related to that movie  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=281) you may have other movies where there is  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=284) a certain artistic element that's  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=286) very deep and very beautiful and so  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=288) there's a meaning behind it so every  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=290) kind of  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=291) shot and every angle and and every you  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=293) know the filmatography and everything  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=295) involved  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=296) has a certain meaning the color of the  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=299) particular movie has a certain  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=301) you know it's supposed to convey a  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=302) certain feeling which has a certain  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=304) meaning  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=305) so we can look at the idea of beauty  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=308) when there's a film that is you know  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=310) related to its beauty and it's  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=312) you know how it's being you know how it  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=314) was being how it was composed  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=316) and how the audience is supposed to look  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=318) at it and think about it deeply  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=319) perhaps um and compare that to let's say  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=322) a movie that was just there for  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=323) entertainment purposes  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=325) that being said the movie that has kind  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=328) of  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=328) more to it has a deeper you know like a  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=330) certain color hue  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=332) a certain a certain way that the the  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=333) movie has been uh recorded  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=335) the the the camera angles uh the types  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=339) of cameras  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=340) the grittiness of the film there's so  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=342) many things that give the film a certain  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=344) feeling  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=345) which is there to allow the audience or  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=348) cause the audience to think  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=349) deeper about the film right so we can  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=352) see  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=352) this distinction between beauty in the  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=355) sense that beauty points  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=357) to meaning and it points to something  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=358) deeper than a surface level meaning when  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=360) we compare  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=361) arts and entertainment so another  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=364) example that we can provide  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=366) is in the realm of uh literature or or  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=369) or or writing and here we can com  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=373) we can compare prose and poetry  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=376) so when we think of prose prose is like  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=378) the composition of something it's just  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=380) something that  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=381) someone has put together and it's  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=382) therefore let's say informational  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=384) purposes  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=385) so you could think of something like an  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=387) organic chemistry textbook  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=390) poetry on the other hand has an  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=392) additional  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=393) purpose behind it poetry not only is  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=395) there to let's say convey  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=397) some sort of information but it's there  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=400) to not only convey information but it  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=401) has an  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=401) element and add an element of beauty so  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=404) if you think about prose being your  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=405) organic chemistry textbook  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=407) this is something you may read once and  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=409) maybe you need to read it to study for  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=411) an exam  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=412) and then you study for the exam and then  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=413) you maybe never go back to it or maybe  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=415) you go back to it  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=416) just to refer and get some information  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=418) extract some information from it  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=419) but you're really never going to go back  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=421) to it because you you derive some sort  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=423) of deeper pleasure  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=424) out of that i mean well maybe derive  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=426) some pleasure out of it because of the  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=428) subject matter but here we're talking  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=430) about the idea of it's giving you  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=432) information  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=433) and that's pretty much it whereas when  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=435) you compare that to  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=436) poetry poetry is something more  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=440) poetry has a pleasure that that that  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=443) that is  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=444) more than just extracting information  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=446) from something  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=447) so if i was to to to read out a poem by  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=451) emily dickinson which is called  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=452) um hope is the thing with feathers let's  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=455) now  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=456) take a look at it and listen to this  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=458) particular poem  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=459) so emily dickinson writes hope is the  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=462) thing with feathers  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=464) it perches in the soul and sings the  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=467) tune without words  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=469) and never stops at all so now what we  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=472) see here is that there's a concept  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=473) that's being put forth that is hope  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=475) and it's being described as a you know  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=478) in this case  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=479) a bird let's say and there's a certain  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=482) beauty to the way the words have been  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=485) put together  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=486) and the and the feeling that it gives to  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=489) the person that's reading the particular  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=490) poem because they  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=492) may be able to understand hope and they  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=494) understand hope as a concept but now  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=496) there's something deeper related to hope  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=498) so hope is the thing with feathers that  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=501) perches in the soul  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=503) and sings the tune without words and  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=506) never stops at all  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=508) and sweetest in the gale is heard and  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=511) sore must be the storm now think about  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=514) this  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=515) you know person that's going to the  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=516) vicissitudes of life's the ups and downs  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=519) and then they have this thing called  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=520) hope and the way that emily dickinson is  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=523) now  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=524) is is describing it in by way of poetry  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=527) it's it's it a person would have a  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=530) certain pleasure in reading that because  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=532) they can  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=533) they can see themselves in it perhaps so  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=536) and swedish in the gale is heard and  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=538) sore must be the storm that could abash  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=541) the little bird  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=542) that kept so many warm again we're  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=544) talking about hope here right  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=546) i've heard it in the chilliest land and  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=549) the strangest sea  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=550) and yet never in extremity  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=554) it asked a crumb of me  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=557) so there's a certain beauty to that  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=558) there's a certain you know  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=560) it's something that transcends just mere  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=562) extraction of information  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=564) and so we find when we compare prose and  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=566) poetry  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=568) the same phenomena when we were talking  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=570) about  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=571) beauty pointing towards something deeper  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=574) it has a meaning but it's something  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=575) deeper you can come back to this poem  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=576) and read it again  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=577) there's a phenomenon that happens  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=579) whereby you derive a certain pleasure  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=581) and you can go back to and say what did  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=582) the author mean and what was the meaning  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=584) behind  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=585) x y and z and this line and that line  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=587) and this word  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=588) or this sentence coming with this  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=590) sentence and so on and so forth  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=591) that you would go back to it over and  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=593) over and over again in fact when we  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=595) speak about prose and poetry  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=597) um clenus brooks he writes in the heresy  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=600) a paraphrase  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=601) he addresses the topic of can a poem be  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=604) paraphrased  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=605) and he says that the reason why and  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=609) notice that it's called a heresy or  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=610) paraphrase in other words you can't  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=612) paraphrase a poem  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=613) um the reason why it would be wrong  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=616) in a sense or you can't paraphrase a  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=619) poem  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=620) he gives a few reasons as to why that  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=622) would not be the case why a person  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=624) could not engage with trying to  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=626) paraphrase  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=627) a poem he says number one poetry can  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=629) express  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=630) several thoughts at the same time and  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=632) this is true if you know when you look  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=634) at  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=634) various poems there are numerous of  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=637) numerous thoughts that can be expressed  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=639) by way of one sentence within the poem  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=641) let alone the poem itself  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=643) number two poems are polysemious  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=646) in other words there's meanings conveyed  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=648) on several levels  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=650) and that's also true when we think about  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=651) poetry there's several levels and layers  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=654) that one can understand and one can  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=657) investigate in terms of its meaning  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=659) meaning is lost in any paraphrase in  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=662) other words  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=663) when you try to paraphrase and to give  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=665) an extreme example of this when you try  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=667) to translate  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=668) one poem from one language to another  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=670) you find that there is something that is  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=672) lost and that thing that is lost  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=676) is that pleasure that one derives  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=679) from the poem itself or a a a  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=682) level of that pleasure and you can think  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=684) about this when you translate  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=686) like one poem from one language to  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=687) another in the original language  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=689) there is a certain level of beauty that  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=693) in most cases cannot be in the other  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=695) language you may be able to give  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=696) some element of the beauty because  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=699) there's a certain meaning that's been  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=700) extracted from it and you can you can  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=702) but the original beauty of the poem the  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=705) original  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=705) sound the original uh cadence of the  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=708) poem  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=709) that is something that's very difficult  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=711) when you try to translate it  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=713) or you try to paraphrase the poem  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=715) there's something that's lost  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=717) and then the fourth one is really  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=718) interesting because clan is brooks then  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=720) says  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=721) sound is important because in many poems  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=724) there's a rhyming scheme or there's a  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=727) way in which the words come together  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=728) such that the sound  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=730) gives a certain type of meaning and this  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=732) is you know true when it comes to  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=734) poems this is true when it comes to even  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=736) the quran for instance  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=738) there are certain you know places and  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=740) elements of the quran  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=741) where the sound is indicative of a very  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=744) specific meaning  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=745) and because the sound is the way it is  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=748) it enhances the meaning  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=749) so we see that in this concept of  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=752) conceptuality when we're talking about  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=754) conceptualizing beauty  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=755) when we're talking about the idea of  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=756) beauty being attached to meaning and  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=758) that meaning is something deeper than  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/sdMYWj65pY0?t=759) the surface level
